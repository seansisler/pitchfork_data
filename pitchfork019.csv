There Is a Difference,Demolition Doll Rods,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b960eb335119a49ec763/1:1/w_160/ba665a48.jpg,2006-04-30 06:00:54,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2275-there-is-a-difference/,Swami,"In Detroit's racial hall of mirrors, the Doll Rods' rock'n'roll minstrel show registers about as much as another building collapse. Forget their Brother J.C. Crawford moments on ""Open Up Your Door"" and their pseudo-spiritual, plantation-aping ""ain't nobody do me like Jesus"" ""Medley""; they have still duller weapons in store. Among them: Ramones familial surnames, Stooges attitude, and New York Dolls boy-as-girl-in-the-city (or Joan Jett, girl-as-boy-in-the-city) looking for action. Their sex life could be as fictional as their Doll Rod last names-- even if they play shows without clothes on, and call their new record There Is a Difference, as in two gender-opposite kids looking down their little shorts. Remember how on-the-way-to-school-we-broke-all-the-rules we once were? Sometimes I think I do-- on ""Where My Baby Be"", say, where they do the chorus like debauched Angels, or on ""Booty Call"", where she calls Danny Doll Rod and says she wants action, and he tells her action is his middle name, and I imagine this happened to me once. Is ""action"" anybody's real middle name? Lies do clear the way for good fiction. Demolition Doll Rods tell a bedtime story, the only one: Getting laid, over and over again. Drummer Christine Doll Rod is a Meg White-like bass-and-tom kicker, steady and pumping, though she's not really any good at the instrument. Add that to infinitely repetitive hooks, like ""She don't like nobody but me"" (""Baby Say Unh!"") and ""Honey yeah I wanna take you home"" (""Take You Home""), and loop the same blues lick they stick between each one, and you've got yourself a decent approximation of your standard missionary old-school sex-rock. OG jaded pervert Iggy Pop took 'em on tour with him once, and he would know. Suppose they're not very likable, and they're nihilists in their endless focus on one idea-- fucking-- till it seems as tired as brushing your teeth, and their blues revival screech and three-chord skronk and big chorus are pushing for the grave faster every time they do them. Suppose that's the big idea. ""The first thing that you'll know? You'll be ready for the grand finale, so come on baby let's go let's go let's go let's go.""","Detroit rock band tells a bedtime story, the only one: Getting laid, over and over again.

Meme,Milosh,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38869fc7814a47cd680/1:1/w_160/40690ded.jpg,2006-04-30 06:00:53,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5690-meme/,Plug Research,"Some albums reward close attention; Milosh's Meme repels it. Which is not to say that this Canadian's second full-length is a repellent work-- just a recessive one. On each of the album's 11 cuts, words dissolve into whispered vowels, vocals into the mix's cushy mid-range, until finally the song excuses itself into the background of whatever conversation you happen to be having. Milosh occupies a hallway, as it were, between bedroom singer-songwriter and lounge producer. His album's packaging-- an earnest black-and-white close-up of an earnest Milosh-- suggests the former, and so does the backstory. Meme is supposed to have a theme, and a grand one at that: the breakup with the girl who inspired his debut, You Make Me Feel. Problem is, judged by the standards of confessional songwriting, Milosh fails the most fundamental test: We don't hear a thing about him on the entire album. Unlike his Plug Research labelmate Mia Doi Todd, whose fascinating persona holds every note together even as she swings from plucky folk to don't ask-Dntel electro to cod reggae and back, Milosh is a complete cipher. The good news is that we shouldn't care. Milosh is not really a James Bluntian sensitive dude, or, at any rate, he's not only that. He may attempt to graft a singer-songwriterly, uh, meme onto an album of sweet micro-produced electronica with barely any lyrics on it, but we don't have to fall for it. What we have on our hands is a roll of moody wallpaper that will play brilliantly, which is to say opaquely, in a Schrager-designed hotel lobby, or in any bedroom with a Barcelona chair carefully angled to ""interact"" with a strategic throw pillow. Milosh arrives at his recipe in the first ten seconds of the opener and from there never falters: treated piano loops, gentle pats of percussion (clicks-and-cuts, but nothing too sharp), and breathy vocals that denote neither sadness nor seduction, but rather, a sort of abstract luxury. ""Emo"" has so overtaken our vocabularies that it's basically become a synonym for ""plaintive""-- I have already seen the word applied to Milosh; if anything, he sounds vaguely like Sade. The songs build vertically, by adding and subtracting textures over a basic loop; unconcerned with momentum, they start, go on for a bit, and give up the ghost with one last vanilla-scented breath. Sometimes a line breaks through, such as ""Ooh, I made you cry last night"", and then we're back to the coo. On ""Couldn't Sleep"", Milosh tries some R&B; melisma, but...politely. Breakup album or not, this is essentially makeout music-- albeit scrubbed clean of any sweaty residue. The most energy the disc musters is on ""Playing With Yen"", which opens with faux-Eastern bells but acquires an urgent mid-period Depeche Mode synth riff halfway in. Naturally, this song is the closer. I rarely get to review music this docile. This is, in itself, a respite. The background is not the worst place to be if the party is good enough.","On his second full-length, this Canadian artist occupies a space between bedroom singer-songwriter and lounge producer.

Our Love Will Destroy the World,Birchville Cat Motel,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b8c0084474cd0c055a/1:1/w_160/ea1252b9.gif,2006-04-30 06:00:52,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1203-our-love-will-destroy-the-world/,PsuedoArcana,"Operating under the name Birchville Cat Motel for more than a decade, New Zealand's Campbell Kneale has mapped a formidable, boundless body of drone. Across the course of his innumerable available (and hopelessly unavailable) recordings, Kneale has crafted his various free-form creations with an uncommon patience and a painterly eye for detail, resulting in a catalog that veers dramatically from austere electronic flutter to ferocious scorched-earth noise. Kneale's work has become increasingly guided by the pull of black/doom metal in recent years, as best exemplified by his sludgy productions as Black Boned Angel. This inclination is in glorious display on Our Love Will Destroy the World, a new Birchville full-length that inseparably marries Kneale's mile-deep electric drones and jacked-up Neu!/Hawkwind propulsion to create a gnarled, ridiculously savage heavy-psych juggernaut. On many of Birchville's past albums, such as last year's exquisite With Maples Ablaze, Kneale has been joined by collaborators like Reynols, Dead C's Bruce Russell, and Lee Ranaldo. It's unclear, however, whether Kneale had any guests contribute to the multi-tracked ensemble din of Our Love. Despite its full-band assault the album advances with such a concentrated, beam-like focus that it sounds as though it might have been transmitted onto tape directly via one man's seething brainwaves. Two of the five tracks here originally appeared on 2003's out-of-print Screamformelongbeach CD-R. Among the others is the centerpiece, the seismic, 16-minute riff-mantra ""55,000 Flowers For the Hero"", an Acid Mothers Temple-style piledriver whose emotive impact is somewhat akin to being overtaken by a swift-flowing river of molten asphalt. Incredibly dense with massed overtones of guitar and electronics, this track appears at once monolithic yet dazzlingly intricate in its drifting shadows, shedding excess layers as it very gradually melts away to a lone specter of amp distortion. Likewise, ""Heaven's Flaming Horse"" combines sawblade drones and turbulent grindcore rhythms to forge an insoluble, corrosive mass of charred flesh and spent wiring, reducing metal's flash and bombast down to an endlessly intense, solitary roar. Following this barrage the melodic ""Lay Thy Hatred Down"" appears as an oasis of tranquility, the counterpoint of Kneale's sedate guitar and woodwind figures providing the listener a brief respite from the album's high-octane oblivion. The mysterious organ and doctored-tape drone of ""Double Cascade Mini Fantasy"" adds a welcome touch of gothic confusion; the set-closing title track is another tortured, color-saturated Sabbath riff, bombarded from all angles with random debris and piercing electronic wails. Less authoritative and hypnotic than the earlier ""55,000 Flowers"", this redundant finale comes as a slight letdown, though it is somewhat redeemed by its prolonged outro of vibrant, stray particles that careen about as if in desperate search for another unfathomable riff to ride. And judging by Kneale's overall productivity and obvious passion for Birchville's new, heavier direction, the guess here is the wait for that riff will not be long.","With an uncommon patience and a painterly eye for detail, New Zealand's Campbell Kneale maps out a formidable, boundless body of drone.

Rio Grande Blood,Ministry,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c548eb335119a49ed990/1:1/w_160/3ff08fc8.jpg,2006-04-30 06:00:51,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5311-rio-grande-blood/,Megaforce,"Lately, Ministry has gradually become The Al Jourgensen Show; while other musicians have filled in on bass and guitar, none have left a significant stamp on the songs. But Rio Grande Blood, Jourgensen's 10th proper full-length under the Ministry name and second focusing on the Bush administration, alters this trend. On guitar is Prong frontman and former Danzig member Tommy Victor, who adds his characteristic squealing harmonics and complex, quick-fingered riffing. Taking care of the low end is Paul Raven, also formerly of Prong, but better known for his stint with the highly influential Killing Joke. Given that Rio Grande Blood is Ministry's strongest collection of tracks in more than a decade (not an overstatement-- keep in mind, we're talking Filth Pig era), the addition of these two from Industrial Metal's Council of Elders is not likely coincedental. Musically, this album follows the same basic formula Ministry have relied on since at least The Land of Rape and Honey: The songs are fast-paced, the guitars chug over drum-machine beats, and Jourgensen's distorted vocals wail atop it all. But while nothing much may have changed in Jourgensen's camp over the years, the formula isn't nearly as limiting in the hands of these musicians. This first becomes apparent on ""Señor Peligro"", when Victor makes his presence felt with a speedy opening riff that balances palm-muting and raw fretboard friction. He's got the chops-- and carefully laid accents-- required to pull off speed-metal riffing without sounding generic. Gone is the computer-program sterility of recent Ministry: Victor's guitar work is dynamic and human. Jourgensen's imaginative use of vocal effects helps to differentiate these songs. On ""Gangreen"", his voice is shiny and metallic, recalling 1988's ""Destruction"". Unfortunately, it also features a guest vocal appearance by someone named Sgt. Major, allegedly a former drill instructor, who spews lame insults throughout the track. Later, on ""LiesLiesLies"", Jourgensen's vocals are deep, gruff, and raw, much like the death metal growl characteristic of Psalm 69. And though Ministry were never known for melody, their best work was always marked by subtle melodic sketches, which recur here, to powerful effect, for the first time in years. Further mixing things up are additional vocal contributions from Jello Biafra (on the unfortunately titled ""Ass Clown"") and Liz Constantine (on ""Khyber Pass""). But ultimately, Rio Grande Blood isn't likely to attract any new fans. Jourgensen's attempted to branch out before without success and he now seems resigned to stick with what tends to work best. Yes, Rio Grande Blood rehashes Psalm 69, but as long as Jourgensen has talented musicians along for the ride, Ministry could do a lot worse.","Al Jourgensen's 10th proper Ministry LP and second focusing on the current Bush administration features contributions from former members of Killing Joke, Prong, and Danzig.

Living With War,Neil Young,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaee13d1975652139b0e/1:1/w_160/582279f2.jpg,2006-04-30 06:00:50,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8856-living-with-war/,Reprise,"Four dead in O-hi-o. Southern man, when will you pay them back? A kinder, gentler machine gun hand. Like many musicians of his generation, Neil Young has never shied away from political statements. However, his views haven't always been easy to pigeonhole as left-leaning, complicated as they are by Nixon-empathy (""Campaigner""), his early-80s support for Reagan, and most recently, his ill-advised United 93 quickie tribute ""Let's Roll"" (not as lingeringly embarrassing as Paul McCartney's ""Freedom"", but a stumble nonetheless). These mercurial politics have a lot to do with Young's impulsive nature; as his manager Elliot Roberts put it in Jimmy McDonough's biography Shakey, ""If he watches TV on the road and there's a CNN special on Bosnia, Neil wants do a record and a benefit within two days."" With his attention now directed toward the current Bush administration and Iraq war, that M.O. hasn't changed; in fact, the internet's greased distribution wheels have fueled it, allowing Living With War to travel from studio to stream to stores in roughly a month's time. This fast-track approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Lyrically, Living With War captures all the indignant ferocity and off-the-cuff logic of a blog-post screed: calls for impeachment, ""Mission Accomplished"" mockery, etc. Obviously, Young's not dishing out well-measured, footnoted policy analysis here, but neither is he bothering with metaphor or subtlety-- it's all direct, literal, and viscerally emotional. It's a bold move: Shooting from the hip opens Young up to a whole list of easy talking-point criticisms (""oh my god, he was born in Canada!""), and the proper-name references almost guarantee a brief shelf life. But from a musical perspective, Living With War's short gestation benefits Young's performance, inspiring him to make his loudest, rawest release of new material since at least Ragged Glory, maybe even Rust Never Sleeps. With his guitar re-tuned to its characteristic distorted snarl, and the clearly live mix preserving bum notes and sloppy harmonica or trumpet solos, Young returns to the spontaneous recording style of albums like Tonight's the Night that best suits his talents. Coming hot on the heels of the contemplative Prairie Wind, the serrated guitar of ""After the Garden"" and ""Restless Consumer"" quickly puts to rest any notion that post-aneurysm, sixty-something Neil was going to slip quietly into retirement. The album's most effective political statement-- the decision to use a 100-strong choir for backing vocals-- has little to do with the lyrics. As unrehearsed as the main instruments, the choir is used not for pretentious ends, but as a way to turn every song into a mass protest, with Young's distinctive howl falling back into the mix behind the wall of voices on the title track or the centerpiece ""Let's Impeach the President"". Ironically, preaching to the choir with a choir saves Young's complaints about cable news, photo-ops, and pharmaceutical ads from succumbing to faded-hippie fogeyism. Alongside Bruce Springsteen's We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, Living With War is the second album this spring on which an elder rock statesman makes an effective protest record with a raucously communal approach, reverently covering historically heavy anthems along the way (""America the Beautiful"", in this case). As a political statement, however, Young's record may be more fleeting, with its topical references to steroids and New Orleans. But despite the press releases, the impulsive politics of Living With War are almost incidental to its success, mere fuel for Neil Young to return to the vicious sound he's neglected in recent times.","Like Bruce Springsteen's We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, this album features an elder rock statesman making an effective protest record thanks to a raucously communal approach.

Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey,Lifetime,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd05c0084474cd0c2beb/1:1/w_160/5d1cb27d.jpg,2006-04-27 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4781-somewhere-in-the-swamps-of-jersey/,Jade Tree,"Lifetime bookmarked my formative New Brunswick, N.J. years: I arrived in 1992, around the time the band released its full-length debut, and left for the West Coast in 1997, within weeks of its breakup. Even during that vibrant peroid, it was an underdog city; since then, the best local clubs have been bulldozed and the indie record store that signed my checks went kaput. Still, New Brunswick possesses a rock aura largely because of Lifetime (and, okay, the Bouncing Souls) and the subsequent success of Thursday, a band who likely wouldn't have existed without their elders. Unlike many other hardcore favorites, Lifetime progressed substantially over the course of their career-- their last two albums, Hello Bastards (1995) and Jersey's Best Dancers (1997)-- are their best work and classics in the genre. Why bother with the history? Because those two records are the reason Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey exists. Angular, honed, stuffed with feedback, lyrically taut, they deliver resonant pop-hardcore shards that transcend the ""emo"" tag by a mile. There are those complexly scissor-fight guitar parts, fault-line structures, and muscular drums, but the centerpieces are Ari Katz's poetic pen and exploded monotone, the latter which comes off agitated, bored, and heartsick all in the same line. Katz slurs his best lyrics, chopping sentences into weird line breaks. The effect is weirdly hypnotic. It doesn't get more heartbreakingly introspective (and introspectively triumphant) than ""Hey Catrine"" or more carefully observed than memorizing the map a girl squints in ""Turnpike Gates"". Plus, even just looking at Hello Bastards' appropriation of the Housemartins London O Hull 4's cover art, it was clear they were lighting out into more interesting territory than your average post-Minor Threat youth crew. The older, baggy-pants material isn't as strong, but it possesses a raw, charismatic appeal and melodic sense lacking in most East Coast straightedge rock. Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey makes this early, pre-Jade Tree work available en masse: The self-titled New Age records 7"", the ""Tinnitus"" 7"" EP, three versions of the Background LP-- straight up, remixed, and as a live set-- compilation tracks, and a pair of covers (Billy Bragg's ""New England"" and Embrace's ""Money""). Background is historically important, but it's awkward as a three-peat. I appreciate ""You"" and ""Thanks"" (sounding very Hüsker Dü in its remixed form), but three times? That said, the most interesting take is the 2005 overhaul: It's sharper, brighter, the guitars more pronounced, the drums super-sized. It's so superior to the original that it seems odd they bothered including the old version on the unnecessary second disc. It's nice for purists to have both that and the live archival stuff, but otherwise the second slab feels like a justification for the 52-page perfect-bound booklet, which comes amply packed with liner notes, lyrics, and photographs. Those visual accouterments are great, but why not pack disc two with additional rarities or practice tapes? Whatever my gripes, disc one's tight. It's great to listen again to ""Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey"", originally released as the superior B-side to the ""Boy's No Good"" 7"". Same goes for 1994's ""Ferret"", which takes a minute or so to kick into a quicker gear; when it does, it shifts to a blissfully emotive harmony. ""Isae Aldy Beausoleil"" and the rest of the stuff from the Seven Inches compilation is here as well, but the real collector gems are previously unreleased remixes of Jersey's Best Dancers material: A mellow, differently enunciated ""Young, Loud, and Scotty"" and a fuzzed-out ""Bringin' It Backwards"", featuring a less explosive mosh coda than the album version. The rawer ""Theme Song For a New Brunswick Basement Show"" is appealing in its apropos basement-karaoke quality. But why Lifetime? Why now? As most folks know, they recently signed to Decaydance, a subsidiary of Fueled By Ramen run by Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. Cynics and angsty teens are shaking their heads, but Lifetime were climaxing when they split and remain friends (or, at least friendly), so why not? In their first incarnation, New Brunswick's finest delivered their sounds in a tiny van, crashing on friends' popcorn strewn floors. Their music has always reflected that road-wizened, pre-Warped Tour sensibility-- the production never slick, but always tight. That in mind, guessing which direction the band takes with the new record will be fascinating. Wisely, they're sticking with Steve Evetts, who recorded their last two records. Smart, because their legacy could largely depend on it (no pressure, dudes). But whatever, even if they weren't returning to hopefully breathe some life into a fairly stale genre, Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey successfully provides a snapshot of an important moment in hardcore and post-hardcore before it become a million-dollar industry. Here's hoping they get some of that cake, too.","Compilation makes the pop-hardcore band's pre-Jade Tree work available en masse.

Psychic Secession,Yellow Swans,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab1fc0084474cd0c12f5/1:1/w_160/ef15361a.jpg,2006-04-27 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8912-psychic-secession/,Load,"Yellow Swans' penchant for myth-making-- they often go by D. Yellow Swans, so that the ""D"" can stand for, you know, different things-- tends to hide just how well-meaning they can be when they're not trying so hard. The first Yellow Swans studio full-length came titled Bringing the Neon War Home, cause that's what they wanted to do; here, they call for Psychic Secession, because that's where they're headed. Leader Pete Swanson wants to bring us along: ""From false election to fear conspiracy/ I had to change my mind/Psychic secession/ We have to change our minds"". Swanson and fellow Swan Gabriel Mindel Saloman are third-way guys-- oppositional, yes, but inclusive as well. The line ""I woke up with dreams in my life"" from the song ""I Woke Up"" rings twice: Once lyrically, and once at the song's 5:10 mark, when their decaying and nihilistic junk gets brought back to life with just handclaps and a skipping drum machine. The track's ensuing effects are spun out and yo-yoed back with charisma; the beats stitched together by three additional percussion credits. Of their brethren in beats-- Forcefield, Mindflayer, Wolf Eyes-- Yellow Swans' noise is less crowd-oriented in the neck-injuring sense, but more catchy: They get up into not just your gut, but your friend's, too. In their common denominating way, Yellow Swans feel (but don't sound) like Swanson's other part-time pastime, Badgerlore, who united their friends by hanging out in the woods away from it all on Stories for Owls, a forest in which everybody got to play an instrument. ""True Union"", a song that asks to ""seal us in a true union,"" takes the ghostly delicacy of Badgerlore and applies to it feedback and backbeats built of fuzz. Cinematic in scope but comfortable in scale, it's calming, jittery, and, just when they've got you on their team, violent: Bellowing arching screams and vocoder, oceanic wave-crash, and electronic burns make whatever peaceful union they forge into a threat. There are those who want Yellow Swans, like they want fellow former Narnack roster guys Parts and Labor, to ""save"" noise from itself: put a beat to it, melody on top of it, or bring hooks-- to make the stuff sound unlike itself. But if the Load Records tag on Psychic Secession didn't clue you, Yellow Swans aren't pandering or fleeing their pack: They are those outsider dudes, not salesmen. If their pitch is attractive, maybe it's not them; maybe it's you.","Load band is less crowd-oriented but more catchy than its noise brethren (Forcefield, Mindflayer, Wolf Eyes).

Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02e5e6ef959693234f2/1:1/w_160/5ffe6d38.jpg,2006-04-27 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3692-monsieur-gainsbourg-revisited/,Barclay,"If the tribute album isn't the lowliest of all arts, it's pretty close. The number of good ones can be counted on two hands, if you're feeling particularly generous, and the number of bad ones would give an EPA director night sweats over all that future landfill space. (And that's before we get into the string quartet tributes or jazz remix discs.) There are so many variables going into each one-- the unfuckwithability of the original compositions, the skill set of the interpreters, the compiler's choices of both song and artist-- that their uniform awfulness is kind of amazing. And I can't imagine there's much money in them. And yeah, this one sucks, too. Serge Gainsbourg is one of the 20th century's great perverts. I mean, fuck music, Gainsbourg would make Boccaccio blush. A Russian Jew whose parents fled to Paris from the Bolsheviks, Gainsbourg studied art, painted, and eventually found his way into a musical. He was far from a pin-up and initially wanted to just write the songs, not sing them. But in the late 1960s, Gainsbourg met, befriended, and eventually bedded Brigitte Bardot, with whom he recorded a string of duets whose overripe arrangements were only matched by their leering eroticism. After splitting from Bardot, Gainsbourg repeated the trick with Jane Birkin. A wit, a wag, and a dirty old man, Gainsbourg was the stereotype of the literate, oversexed Frenchman come to life. And though his commercial fame peaked in the early 70s, his work only became more complex and, well, filthy as time went on. (And really, the fact that his only remote American hit, ""Je T'aime...Mon Non Plus"" stalled at No. 69-- how good is that?) He died in 1991. So lets get a bunch of English-speaking artists to pay homage to him. And then, wait for it, lets translate the lyrics into English. Badly. (Oh and the titles too, for good measure.) Think about that for a minute. An artist known for his subtle wordplay, puns, and allusions run through Alta Vista Babelfish and fact-checked by an 8th grade French class. Have you clicked off the review yet? Things don't fare much better on the musical end. A decade ago, Tricky could have turned ""Au Revoir Emmannuel"" into something dark, demonic, and sexy. Today he's, well, Tricky in 2006. Likewise, the inclusion of meat-and-potatoes Britrock band the Rakes is baffling, since they deliver a meat-and-potatoes Britrock rendition of ""Le Poinconneur des Lilas"". A Futureheads rendition would have been goofy, like a teenage boy trying to write erotica, but at least would have had a certain charm to it. And could anyone be more wrong for the ironic twists of Gainsbourg songs than the ultra-earnest Michael Stipe? (Oh, Brian Molko, you and your yarl can fuck back off to the 90s.) The slim, so to speak, highlights: You have to assume that the old man would have approved of Chan Marshall and Karen Elson's version of ""Je T'aime""-- almost a parody of breathy, laconic-to-the-point-of-catatonia female delivery. The Kills strip down ""Le Chanson De Slogan"" to its frame and take it as black as their hair. Portishead sound thinner and less glutinous than they did a decade ago, closer to the rustic ambience of the Beth Gibbons solo album (though that old ""Sour Times"" melodrama would have worked a treat in this context). And Jarvis Cocker and Marc Almond are the only two people on this record who should be covering Serge Gainsbourg, even if both are a bit too panto for their own good. With a more imaginative compiler--and fewer Big Names whose fame peaked years ago-- Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited could have turned out so much different. Just imagine Matthew Herbert (who's already remixed ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to great effect) and Roísín Murphy tackling one of these songs. Le sigh.","Serge Gainsbourg tribute album translates song lyrics into English and features contributions from Cat Power, Jarvis Cocker, Portishead, and Tricky, among others.

All the Young Dudes / Mott,Mott the Hoople,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3855e6ef95969323859/1:1/w_160/be043798.jpg,2006-04-27 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11786-all-the-young-dudes-mott/,ColumbiaColumbia,"On the whole, classic rock radio is a pretty macho affair, full of ""Hot Legs"", ""Big Balls"", and ""Radar Love"". In a certain respect, Mott the Hoople's biggest hit (and only contribution to American classic rock playlists) fits right in: ""All the Young Dudes"" is upfront with its sexual desire and horny, twenty-something lust. There is one catch: It's also a celebration of the glam's gender-bending aesthetic. At the time of its release, Mott the Hoople were wallowing in obscurity despite releasing four albums of high-powered boogie. They were ready to pack it in, but David Bowie encouraged them to soldier on, offering Mott the chance to record ""Suffragette City"". The band, though, wanted ""Drive-In Saturday"", which Bowie wasn't willing to part with. ""All the Young Dudes"" was the compromise. In the short term, Bowie came out looking the genius, as the band briefly achieved the stardom they felt was rightfully theirs, kicking out their two best albums in the process. But it couldn't last, and by 1974, guitarist Mick Ralphs was off playing in Bad Company and Mott faded back to the margins. Mott the Hoople are still a widely respected and influential band, and it's pretty easy to hear why-- they've got the swagger, confidence, and riffs of glam and the basic approach of punk. That's not to mention vocalist Ian Hunter, whose voice was so limited and colorless that he probably made more than a few kids with guitars think ""if this guy can sing in a band, surely I can."" The band, however, found countless ways to work around Hunter, from melodic harmonizing on the choruses that he could yelp and talk-sing over to clever lead guitar parts that Ralphs used to inject hooks into the verses. So Hunter becomes the everyman, just trying to get by, and the tension between the band's chops and his lack of skill and range is oddly poignant. All the Young Dudes closes with the dejected piano ballad ""Sea Diver"", a crushingly sad song that uses a diving bell as a metaphor for being trapped in a failed relationship. Hunter's inability to get through half an octave without cracking or morphing into a dock worker's shout sucks out all the maudlin potential of the piano part and string arrangement, turning them instead into a kind of security blanket. It's a strikingly emotional capstone to an album that mostly trades in funky rock and roll and leather-pantalooned swagger. Young Dudes highlight ""Sucker"" is a slow, cowbell-guided rocker adorned with sax interjections from Bowie; it features a killer call-and-response between a harpsichord and a wordless backing vocal phrase on its chorus. The reissue appends a thunderous live version that suggests the band's true power wasn't really captured on any of its records. However, there's also a live version of ""Sweet Jane"" that's as forgettable as the studio version that leads off the original album. Conventional revisionist rock crit wisdom says this is a five-star record, but in truth it's not even close, and that song is a big part of the reason. Elsewhere, a primordial version of ""Ready for Love"" pales in comparison to the version Bad Company took into the charts two years later, but the band gets in some strong hard boogie tunes on ""Momma's Little Jewel"" (the early demo version added here, called ""Black Scorpio"", is even nastier) and ""One of the Boys"", the rocking follow-up single to ""All the Young Dudes"". Bowie-philes will love the version of ""All the Young Dudes"" featuring his vocal, even though it's weaker than the version everyone knows. Mott follows the band's biggest moment with a concept album about rock'n'roll success. You could argue that they'd hardly experienced enough fame to complain about it, but the songs are so humane and devoid of self-pity that it's impossible to hold it against them. ""All the Way From Memphis"" opens the album with a charging piano rhythm, and the harmony vocals on the chorus are one of the band's catchiest moments. It's a classic song in waiting, a nearly perfect throwback to the first rock era. If the whole album stuck to that kind of meat-and-potatoes brilliance, the band could have been sitting on a masterpiece, but the songs on which they depart from the basics aren't nearly as compelling. ""Violence"" offers stark evidence that weird wasn't their territory, as Hunter sounds more drunk than unhinged on the off-kilter chorus, and interludes of people shouting and arguing add little more than expendable shots of surreal humor. Ralphs gets in an interesting solo on ""Drivin' Sister"", as he interrupts the band's headlong boogie and gets busy with the volume pedal, mimicking a steel guitar. ""The Ballad of Mott the Hoople"" nods to the band's Dylan influence with its rambling lament that ""rock'n'roll's a loser's game"" and humming Hammond organ, but closer ""I Wish I Was Your Mother"" takes it even further, appropriating the dusky ambiance of Dylan's work with the Band and adding mandolin and harmonica to the equation. The band goes exploring on the second half of ""I'm a Cadillac/El Camino Dolo Roso"", cooking up a spooky groove over which Ralphs' searching slide guitar solo directly points the way to his work on Bad Company's first album. Rumor has it that Ralphs left Mott the Hoople because a song he had written was out of Hunter's vocal range, an obstacle he never had with Paul Rodgers singing his stuff. Hunter and the rest of the gang kept on going, logically titling their next album The Hoople, but it wasn't quite the same, and Hunter eventually struck out on his own as well, leaving this sometimes overlooked band with roughly the level of fame their music merited-- a couple of hits and a sizable cult following.","Columbia/Legacy presents expanded reissues of the glam-boogie band's two best albums.

Welcome to My World / Lost and Found,Daniel Johnston,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba189d034d5c69bf5399/1:1/w_160/b68de9c5.jpg,2006-04-27 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11766-welcome-to-my-world-lost-and-found/,High Wire,"People often fret about what it means to be a fan of Daniel Johnston, wondering whether interest in his songs means rubbernecking at his severe mental illness. His true believers worry less. Despite amateurish recordings and peculiar performances, they'll say Johnston is a classic songwriter of the most traditional sort. Hear your way through Welcome to My World, a collection of his most memorable work, and careful listeners would have to admit the believers are onto something: There's no train wreck in the music. These 21 songs might not be the work of the Brian Wilson-level genius some like to claim, but they're far more keen than most people give them credit for-- every bit as musically satisfying as a Bob Pollard or a Jens Lekman or an Anton Newcombe, and rather more emotionally astute, too. It's not the success of a savant, either. Johnston is a student of the heart of the whole pop-rock enterprise, with a musical education that comes from years spent with a piano and a Beatles songbook, changing the order of the chords around to create new sequences-- check out the sophisticated double-time changes in ""Lennon Song"". Bob Dylan's in there, too, and Elvis Costello, who Johnston impersonates with comical efficiency on ""Man Obsessed"". Beach Boys, Big Star, Hank Williams-- this stuff comes from the wellspring of pop-music basics, and Johnston knows his way around it as well as the next rock geek. He writes compelling melodies, even when he can't deliver them well, and his lyrics are well formed, coherent, and consistent in their metaphors. He can be cutting and clever (look to the devil's lines in ""Never Relaxed""), moving and seemingly wise (""Some Things Last a Long Time""), and alarmingly self-aware about his relationship with his fans (""Peek-a-Boo""). His subject matter pulls in a lot of very personal quirks, but its core lies in the same stuff everyone deals with-- lovelessness, making a living, all the good old standards. He has plenty to say about them, too, given that his illness has made all those things even more of a struggle than they already are. What makes it all slightly different is the way Johnston made these songs, especially during the 1980s period so many of them come from: The most well known were recorded with only a boombox and a chord organ, in his brother's garage. The sound quality is poor, and Johnston's voice yelps and lisps, wounded and childish, making it that much stranger to hear the conviction in his playing; it's as if he doesn't think there's anything less than star-ready about this music. These are things indie rock fans have been known to cherish, but only so long as they feel like the person on the other end of the tape is just like them-- self-conscious, wilfully amateurish, in on the ""joke."" With Johnston it comes closer to what art-- and ""indie""-- claim to be all about: This is a more honest, less mediated peek into someone else's world. In some ways, we're used to hearing and enjoying the music and ideas of people whose worlds aren't like ours: We happily listen to rock musicians who are almost certainly morons, or whose politics we find ridiculous. How squeamish should we be about looking into the goodhearted world of someone like Johnston-- his naivete, his struggles with everyday life, and the illness that manifested after those early recordings? Why is it we'd praise a song about Casper the Friendly Ghost if it seemed like whimsy, but get uncomfortable when Johnston intends the metaphor in earnest? With the best of these songs, though, even that question falls away: Listen through the strangeness of the circumstances, and Johnston's songs are as normal as yours or mine. Knowing his biography, as many do, helps even more. After failing in college and being shipped off to live in Texas, he taps out a happy rag called ""Chord Organ Blues"" and tries to figure out what he's doing: ""Everything's big in Texas, you know it is/ I think I might have made a big mistake."" He runs away on a moped and writes ""Speeding Motorcycle"", a much-covered ode to the freedom of it: ""We don't need reason and we don't need logic/ Cause we've got feeling and we're damn proud of it."" Knowing that the girl he came closest to loving married a funeral director explains a bit of ""Man Obsessed"": ""The only way you could get her to look at you is to die."" Lines like these are clever, universal, and delivered passionately, with emotional readings that are complicated and convincing. There are times when Johnston's earnestness and naivete work against him, when cliches about love and live seem to spill out of him unexamined: The happy back-porch bounce on ""Living Life"" goes on about ""learning to cope with the emotionless mediocrity of everyday living,"" and the haunting autobiography on ""Story of an Artist"" has a pretty teenaged conception of what being an artist means, complete with banal shots at the normal folks who ""sit in front of their TVs."" But even then we know it's no self-satisfied pose, and Johnston's fundamentally good-hearted enough that it's hard to mind his flaws. Welcome to My World turns out to be a lovely package, and probably as much Johnston as the average listener will need; it's also notably short on the Johnston recordings that sound harrowing and depressed enough to be difficult listening. Lost and Found, the 45-year-old Johnston's newest album, is somewhat harder to recommend. These days, Johnston is better known as a visual artist than as a singer-songwriter, and this makes sense: His magic-marker drawings come from the same place as those early recordings, executed in private and for the sheer expression of it. His music, on the other hand, has come to require collaboration, something Johnston doesn't seem well-suited for: At times it feels like the backing band has shoved him to the front of the stage and started improvising bland, inappropriate things behind him, self-conscious and unsure how to really enter into his songs, leaving him sounding lost and awkward. He also seems a lot more labored and sluggish, in his performance and his emotions, than as a young man, which is where some of the aforementioned fretting comes in: Some of that is surely the result of how medicated he is, bad for his music but good for him. The songs center more and more on that lovelessness, which surely weighs harder on a middle-aged man-- more and more songs revolve around funeral home Laurie-- and some of them still hit. But it probably says something that the most exciting of them is ""The Beatles"", a recreation of a song from the 80s.",,7.7,
Röyksopp's Night Out,Röyksopp,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cab1335d7bf169858b/1:1/w_160/5fdddb7b.gif,2006-04-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6863-royksopps-night-out/,Astralwerks,"Pity downtempo. The genre tag ubiquitously and properly applied to Röyksopp's brand of smooth, pre-dawn electronic-pop must forever endure over-hyphenated allusions to its status as the turn-of-the-Y2K high-end retail-shopping soundtrack of choice (uh, see?). Those who have heard Röyksopp's two albums, 2002's Melody A.M. and last year's The Understanding, won't be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer local Crate & Barrel. And yet the live Röyksopp's Night Out EP isn't completely unlike that store's unnecessary baubles. Put it on your wedding registry: ""What Else Is There"", in which touring singer Anneli Drecker does a great impression of the Knife's Karin Dreijer's studio-version Björk impression, while Röyksoppers TorbjØrn Brundtland and Svein Berge lay out their template of club-thumping drum pads and Airy analogue synths. ""Only This Moment"" finds the frontmen coolly engaging in Depeche Mode mode with guest sighs/moans from the excellent Kate Havnevik. ""Poor Leno (Istanbul Forever Take)"" spreads open the original like a starless night sky, albeit dropping the vocals. An intense ""Remind Me"" rides fashion-show guitars, which work despite the replacement of Erlend Øye with a vocoder. And, yes, Röyksopp do perform Queens of the Stone Age's ""Go With the Flow"", the primary reason the Norwegian band's longtime fans will want this record. Its bleak death-wish lyrics and martial melody make surprising sense amid rocket-propelled synths and understated vocals, but the cover's still a curio when laid beside Röyksopp's superior, original compositions. Plus, the eight-minute ""Alpha Male"" is the same lasers-firing space obelisk dropped on the What Else Is There? EP like, three months ago. Well, we already done reviewed that, and most people who wanted it probably already bought it. Like a $49.95 designer urn or a $79.95 lasagna pan, Röyksopp's Night Out EP is pretty but largely inessential. The uninitiated should pick up either of the full-lengths (or that still-great remix of the Streets' ""Weak Become Heroes""). Nevertheless, the disc makes an argument for Röyksopp's downtempo even staunch rockists can appreciate: It sounds good live. OK, save your pity for another genre. Like maybe mainstream country.","Live mini-album features versions of the Norwegian band's biggest hits, and a cover of Queens of the Stone Age's ""Go With the Flow"".

Hind Hind Legs,The Lovely Feathers,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfa13d197565213b67b/1:1/w_160/b66c7cf0.jpg,2006-04-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5005-hind-hind-legs/,Equator,"The Lovely Feathers seem poised for success: They hail from the buzzing indie beehive of Montreal; they're labelmates with Islands on the newly formed Equator Records; hell, they even have a name derived from the animal kingdom and Marcel Dzama-esque illustrations on their album sleeve. But it isn't merely the contemporary cred signifiers that make Lovely Feathers a potential hype band; it's the music. Armed with a sophisticated pop sensibility, the Lovely Feathers are never short of musical ideas, as they spastically shift tempo, volume, and style in highly compressed spaces. The songs are unpredictable, leaping from barely-there strumming and whispered vocals to bombastic full-band arrangements. Album opener ""Pope John Paul"", for example, effortlessly packs at least five different parts-- only two of which repeat-- into less than four minutes. Unfortunately, the band's eccentric approach to songwriting is mirrored in its disastrously quirky lyrics. Pop music needn't be literate or even literary to be great, of course, but too many of these songs are marred by distractingly precious words. Often the delivery is tongue-in-cheek; elsewhere, cringe-inducers like ""I like the chapped skin above your eyes/ Even when you complain about my hives"" from ""Mildly Decorated"" are sung with what sounds like conviction. Such couplets, when paired with this high level of musical invention, mark the Lovely Feathers as heirs to the Unicorns' legacy of smart-ass pop. But where the Unicorns managed to situate their cloyingly cutesy lyrics in an album-wide concept about death, there's no such coherence here, just grating loose ends. Sometimes the lyrics manage to be amusing, but mostly they're as irritating as the aforementioned chapped skin and hives. Still, there's strong evidence here that the Lovely Feathers are a superb indie pop group in the making; enough, even, to make you forget the lackluster lyrics. ""In the Valley"" is the band at its tightest, as the thumping bass of its disco-tinged intro gives way to razor-sharp guitar interplay and a swooning string section. ""Wrong Choice"" is classic indie rock in the Weezer vein, with sing-along verses and swelling choruses. The Lovely Feathers have the potential to shape their ideas into something more focused, and the songs on Hind Hind Legs would have carried more weight had they not been sabotaged by silliness and fluffy wordplay. Maybe Yanofsky had this in mind on ""Ooh You Shocked Me"", when he sang, ""Who has a heart? I have a heart."" Perhaps next time, he'll prove that sentiment to be more than just another ironic line.","Montreal band are labelmates with Islands on the newly formed Equator Records and are reminiscent of the Unicorns.

Idol Tryouts Two: Ghostly International Vol. Two,Various Artists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7915e6ef95969320ff2/1:1/w_160/8e358d56.gif,2006-04-26 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1898-idol-tryouts-two-ghostly-international-vol-two/,Ghostly,"From the vantage of childhood, the future looks pretty sweet. Cars fly. Wiseacre robot maids work tirelessly yet display the full range of human emotion. Dogs talk, but with catastrophic speech impediments to reassure us that we're still their betters. The subtext is that advanced technology equals richer lives, ipso facto. But then the weird and unfathomable digital age swept that analog idyll into history's dustbin. I understand my old record player, but have no significant grasp of how my computer works. The majority is reliant on devices that only an elite minority knows how to build and repair. We're skeptical of progress and intimidated by our increasingly inscrutable machines, which make us feel isolated and over-stimulated. No wonder digital technology in music, from Radiohead to Godspeed, is often deployed as a tacit critique of the world it's creating, an embodiment of homogeneity, alienation, and dread. Since the turn of the millennium, the Ann Arbor-based electronic music label Ghostly International has stewarded everything from house to ambient, digital pop to electroclash. This label primer is divided into two discs: Avant-Pop showcases Ghostly's more upbeat and structured artists, while the enigmatically titled SMM disc airs out comparatively amorphous fare. But there's some slippage in these characterizations: Benoit Pioulard's ""The Depths & the Seashore"" (from the Avant-Pop disc), with its hypnotic acoustic guitar and spare percussion, would make as much sense on SMM; likewise, the skittering drums and ice-blue melody of Cepia's ""Hoarse"" wouldn't be out of place on Avant-Pop. This malleability is just one of several things that make this comp at least as good, if not better, than individual LPs by the artists it features. Ghostly artists don't know from technophobia or human obsolescence. Their music is united by a utopian bent, a childlike wonder at technology's capacity to express and celebrate the individual spirit. This spirit is evoked by the music's overarching lyricism and its endless variety within narrow parameters. The palette isn't very diverse-- drum machines and samplers, synths and sequencers-- nor is it used very diversely. Throughout Idol Tryouts, precisely molded drums scatter in soft configurations around silent downbeats; bass rubberizes; house beats crest and subside like whitecaps on the sea; melodies shimmer in high-end digital decay. Yet each artist manages to put their own unique stamp on these stock varieties like endless variations on the same essential face. Solvent serves up springy, burnished new wave. Dabrye's durable, staticky instrumental hip-hop sings with sampled woodwinds. Matthew Dear's clicky haunted house stomps in iron boots, while Outputmessage's track cascades down in pinging, elastic waves. Loscil's offering finds supple, jittery beats struggling to escape from a glittering black morass. Greg Davis pits raucous acoustic guitar against an ambient pastel wash. Twine scans across alien radio bandwidth, while Deru recasts the sound of trickling water as svelte electro pop. The often wordless yet consistently eloquent beauty of Idol Tryouts Two sounds a resounding rebuke to the idea that electronic music is cold and unemotional; that it all sounds the same; that guitars and human voices are the only true paths to expression. It's also a testament to the idea that technology can be an agent of freedom and delight, not control and anxiety, when humans use it as a tool and not a crutch.","This 2xCD compilation-- which features contributions from Matthew Dear, Tim Hecker, and Dabrye, among others-- is split into one disc called ""Avant-Pop"" and another, more experimental platter titled ""SMM"".

Catastrophe Keeps Us Together,Rainer Maria,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fcc0084474cd0bff45/1:1/w_160/e2f72031.jpg,2006-04-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6672-catastrophe-keeps-us-together/,Grunion,"On the casino floor at Caesar's Palace, carefully positioned to catch spillover from the adjacent Colosseum Theatre, is a gift shop devoted to a unique and singular brand: the Celine Dion Boutique. Now, I'm not so oblivious as to have missed the luminance of Ms. Dion's starpower, but as a marketable icon, Dion seems a bit hollow, and buying a $250 tracksuit with her name emblazoned on it seems a little like buying merchandise celebrating water or air. This is, after all, a performer whose big-budget Vegas revue features a Cirque du Soleil knockoff troupe to compensate for her shortage of stage presence. Rainer Maria are far from having a replica historical amphitheater built for their performances, never mind the attached gift shop, but over the course of their five-album career their sound has traveled a path toward the kind of big-voice/big-message concept that would pack 'em in at an indie casino (Cosloy's Palace?). Once upon a time, the trio rode the second or third wave of emo, with Kyle Fischer and Caithlin De Marrais hurling raw harmonies at each other like Fleetwood Mac cum Fugazi. But after mastering that dynamic on the first song of their first full-length (""Tinfoil"") the band has refocused their vocal spotlight to train solely on De Marrais. In a technical sense, De Marrais' pipes are powerful enough to carry the band's load, especially now that they don't have to deal with intrusion of Fischer's indie-boy yelp. However, the band has also streamlined their songwriting, whittling away the unconventional turns and multiple pre-choruses that made their earlier material more interesting, leaving emotionally aerodynamic compositions free of atonal snags or polyrhythmic left-turns. Rainer Maria may still be writing love songs, but the relationships of Catastrophe Keeps Us Together appear thematically and musically less complicated and knotty. Even with an occasionally dark-tinged lens, Catastrophe's hearts will go on in widescreen style. The title track turns a grim apocalyptic vision into a repopulation fantasy, De Marrais belting out, ""At the end of the world, I'm gonna find you,"" in true end-credits fashion. Elsewhere, ""Love is...""-like statements are dropped, instructions for relationship success are dispensed, and acoustic guitars are played crisply. Not every story has a happy ending, but songs like ""Life of Leisure"" and ""Already Lost"" don't have anywhere near the meltdown of a good old De Marrais/Fischer screaming match-- and the vocab-heavy narrations fall short of disguising their cloying, cliched sentiments. Fischer's input throughout is restricted to his guitar, which continues Rainer Maria's trend of focusing mostly on echobox atmosphere rather than serrations. Problem is, the punchier parts still sound the best, the four-chord mantra of ""Bottle"" or the overdrive-drenched darting between the drums of ""I'll Make You Mine"" standing out relative to the spacier, flimsier tones of their reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's ""I'll Keep It With Mine"". It's useless to keep wishing hard for the heady days of the mid-90s; like the rest of us, the members of Rainer Maria are different people than they were 10 years ago. But it's still discouraging to see a band that once painted such accurate sound pictures of the complexities of love go the primary-color route of the power-ballad, snipping off the loose ends and hangnails that formerly propelled their relationship updates. Like the anthemic stylings of Ms. Dion, Catastrophe's valentines are direct and glossy, but ultimately as hollow as a gift-shop bauble-- a brand unworthy of a tracksuit.","Former emo stars ditch much of their raw, co-ed harmonies and refocus their vocal spotlight to train solely on Caithlin De Marrais.

Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics,Yo La Tengo,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab01ea9e61561daa5ca4/1:1/w_160/01f3fa87.gif,2006-04-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8873-yo-la-tengo-is-murdering-the-classics/,Egon,"From the right angle, Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics is the funniest record in the world. At first the title only seems sarcastic-- when you listen to the album, it turns out it's just honest, if humorously so. The disc features Yo La Tengo and a few friends flat-out slaughtering other people's songs in on-air performances during WFMU fundraisers. It makes sense that this collection of bootleg-quality recordings of unrehearsed covers would be associated with WFMU, given the freeform radio station's legendary penchant for incorrect and outsider music, and the saving grace of the whole thing is that no one involved is taking it remotely seriously. The deal is this: The members of Yo La Tengo were trying to think of a way they could help their favorite radio station (it, like the band, is located in Northeast New Jersey, although you can tune in from anywhere in the world via their website). Then it struck them that they could perform requests live on the air in exchange for pledges of support. The trick was that they had to play each request on the spot, with no rehearsal or time to remember little things like, say, lyrics. They did it first in 1996, and it's since become a hugely entertaining annual tradition. Gathering requested covers from 1996-2003, Murdering is temporarily charming and fun, but inevitably, its 30 tracks (over 76 minutes!) are a gruelling slog. To be fair, the band members know music inside and out, as the well-rehearsed covers that populate their records (covers album Fakebook, in particular) and concerts demonstrate. Additionally, they have a jazzier sensibility than most rock bands, so interpretation isn't beyond them. But those hoping for anything even close to the ballpark of their studio albums clearly haven't read the warnings all over the band's own website, which kindly inform prospective listeners not to expect much. Besides, they do have a proper album planned for later this year. What I'm getting at is, should you order the disc, you're not really buying a Yo La Tengo album. You're not even buying a live album. You're buying a comedy record, for all intents. The bit where Ira Kaplan forgets the second verse of Three Dog Night's ""Mama Told Me (Not to Come)"", and wisecracks about the band's singer, is great-- though not nearly as funny as the version of Archie Bell & the Drells' ""Tighten Up"" that opens the album. Kaplan's exhortations to ""tighten up on the drums now, Georgia"" are so hilariously geeky they actually sort of work, and both he and fellow guitarist Bruce Bennett (who joined the band for these fundraisers) accidentally come in when Kaplan calls for the bass. James McNew doesn't exactly know the bassline anyway, but he gives it his best shot. There are a few songs Yo La Tengo really nail, like the Modern Lovers' ""Roadrunner"", which Ira spikes with a blistering guitar solo. It's also fitting that they'd turn in a competent rendition of NRBQ's ""Captain Lou"", given that the cult band's cover-request shows were the inspiration for Yo La Tengo's own fundraising appearances. And I honestly cannot believe how well Kaplan remembers the verse lyrics to Huey ""Piano"" Smith's ""Sea Cruise""-- never mind Doug Sahm's ""Mendocino"". On the opposite end of the spectrum, the band's take on Yes' ""Roundabout"" is side-splittingly inept, with someone basically leaning on an organ to approximate Rick Wakeman, while the version of Bachman-Turner Overdrive's ""You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet"" is just plain ghastly (and yet considerably less annoying than the original). Unsurprisingly, the album's best moments are attributable to inspired listener requests. By far the most imaginative of these is the old promotional song ""Meet the Mets"", a jingle advertising New York's less appreciated baseball franchise. What's more impressive is that the band actually knows all the words to it. Later, recalling their Genius + Love collaboration with Daniel Johnston on his ""Speeding Motorcycle"", a young caller named Lela sings ""Route 66"" over the phone while the band plays softly in the background. It's so genuinely sweet that the band's uncertaintly over the chord sequence doesn't much matter. But again, while these are great moments on the air, they don't exactly translate to replay value, so the disc, packaged inside Adrian Tomine's fantastic artwork, becomes just a keepsake for fans of the band and WFMU (or anyone who ever wanted to hear the Knack, the Beach Boys, Sonic Youth, and Bonzo Dog Band in the same ramshackle medley). In short, this is the kind of thing that would have been a fan-club disc back in the 90s. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but much as I love Yo La Tengo, WFMU (possibly the greatest radio station in existence, by the way), and the general idea, it's difficult to give this a genuine recommendation. Instead, save your money for next year's WFMU fundraiser: Tune in, make a pledge, request a song, and brace yourself. It's for a good cause.","Charity album collects the Jersey band's spontaneous, by-request WFMU benefit covers performances, including takes on tracks from the Beach Boys, Sonic Youth, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive.

My Ghetto Report Card,E-40,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd175e6ef95969322faa/1:1/w_160/c2cb893f.jpg,2006-04-25 06:00:09,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2941-my-ghetto-report-card/,Warner Bros.BMEWarner Bros.BME,"The big story in rap last year was Houston. For years, the city had developed its own aesthetic, code words, and sui-generis star system, all while out of sight of the East Coast's cultural gatekeepers. When the rest of the country suddenly took notice, local stars Mike Jones and Paul Wall became national stars, and rappers all over the world started talking about codeine cough syrup and DJ Screw. The same thing is now supposed to happen to California's Bay Area. The region has its own sound, hyphy, which involves lots of berserk, scattered drum-machines, enormous synth-riffs, and brittle, burbling hooks. Like Houston, the city also has its own look and slang and locally based distribution networks. Lil Jon certainly did his best to package the scene and sell it to the rest of the world when he signed E-40, a local legend whose claim to national fame had previously been inventing handfuls of popular hip-hop slang terms. But the album has been out for a month now, and it's not even halfway to gold, so the results are in: The Bay Area is not this year's Houston. The problem is pretty easy to hear in the first five tracks of My Ghetto Report Card-- the album's pure hyphy section. Lil Jon and Bay Area scene-general Rick Rock slap together a set of monster-bangers, but the effect is more exhausting than exhilarating. ""Yay Area"" sounds like robots malfunctioning: frantic off-kilter drums, high-pitched synth squeals, gurgling staccato vocal samples. This stuff has a frenzied, delirious tension and a striking futuristic sheen, but it has none of the sensual restraint of Timbaland, who is a clear influence. Rock and hyphy-version Lil Jon have no idea how to use silence; their tracks are all push and no pull. After about 30 minutes, it begins to feel like an aural version of three cans of Sparks. On the album's second half, Lil Jon is back to his typical tracks: old-school 808s, evil keyboards, sly R&B; whistles, but it's not enough to save the record. E-40 himself doesn't really help matters, basically rapping in Bernie Mac's making-fun-of-white-people voice-- a nervous adenoidal yammer. And he doesn't ride beats so much as fall over them, sloshing his wavery vowels around so much that they sound seasick. 40 loves words, and some of his lines are so dense with regional slang that they barely make sense: ""One of my youngsters just got popped with a thumper/ They tryna wash it/ They talking football numbers."" He can be humurous (""I'm a couple of tacos short of a combination"") or incisive (""The law ain't concerned/ They love us hustlers and dealers/ They wanna tear our houses down so they can build IKEAs""), and he's often a lot of fun. But his goofy-ass flow doesn't lend itself much to serious sentiments. On ""Black Boi"", he delivers this: ""In my days, I was raised in the Church/ Mama did what she could to keep us off the turf/ But it ain't no one to blame/ But Noreaga and Reagan and rock cocaine."" On paper, it looks great, but 40 still sounds as if he's talking about partying. That voice can get old fast, and Lil Jon tries to address the issue by loading virtually every track with guest appearances, but it doesn't work: the guests either utterly school 40 (Too Short, Bun B) or clutter up the track with clumsy nonsense (Juelz Santana, Budda). My Ghetto Report Card has a few great moments. Rick Rock often makes great use of samples: a Digable Planets vocal loop on ""Yay Area"", Bernard Herrmann's Psycho strings on ""Gouda"". And E-40's 18-year-old producer son Droop-E turns in one of the album's strongest tracks with ""Sick Wid It II"", a streaky hyphy banger that manages not to sound way too ADD. On ""U and Dat"", another standout, 40 himself is barely a factor, as Lil Jon's sidelong crunk'n'b track and T-Pain's indelibly sticky vocal hook do all the work. But the album runs way too long at nearly 80 minutes-- six of which are devoted to a soul-crushing song called ""Gimmie Head"", all anemic organ tweets and TMI lyrics (""Shoot it everywhere while I beat my meat/ In ya face, in ya hair, all over the sheets""), and all the party-up fun stuff starts feeling like teeth-gritted forced hedonism long before it should. If hyphy ever does have its cultural moment, it won't be because of this album; it'll be despite it.","Hyphy veteran works with fellow Bay Area scene-general Rick Rock and crunk's mainstream conduit, Lil Jon, to try to cross his sound over to a national audience.

Zeroes and Ones,Eleventh Dream Day,by: Cory D.

Zeroes and Ones is their fourth release for Thrill Jockey, and first since 2000's Stalled Parade. Frankly, their sound hasn't changed much since that album, which saw them working within a broader sonic spectrum than on previous efforts. Here, they continue to focus on mood and texture, whether they're playing straightforward, upbeat rockers or slower, drawn-out numbers full of sprawling guitar work and dry, dusty rhythms. Unfortunately, these tracks don't have the charm of their more traditional jangle-rock, and at times the disc suffers for it. Eleventh Dream Day start strong with ""Dissolution"", a mid-tempo pop song with a bouncy bass line, co-ed vocal harmonies, and driving chorus-- a formula that works throughout most of the first half of the album. The band changes gears with the sprawling, eight-minute ""New Rules"", which slowly builds throughout its first half, and then spends the second half as a showcase for front man Rick Rizzo's squealing guitar work. Sadly, the second half of the album is a hit-or-miss venture. While several songs sparkle (especially ""The Lure"", where Janet Beveridge Bean takes on the lead vocals), the slower tracks are simply too faceless. ""Return of Long Shadow"" is a sort of moody barroom song that never seems to take off, and the album-closing ""Journey With No Maps"" features nice string work and pedal steel, but is nevertheless forgettable. Even with these missteps, Zeroes and Ones won't disappoint those who've been patiently waiting six years for the next chapter in the Eleventh Dream Day saga-- but it won't win them many converts.","Indie veteran's fourth release for Thrill Jockey, and first since 2000's Stalled Parade, finds them working within a broader sonic spectrum than on previous efforts.

Cosmology of Eye,GHQ,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c020eb335119a49ed33c/1:1/w_160/0a490d8f.gif,2006-04-25 06:00:07,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3679-cosmology-of-eye/,Time-Lag,"As always, the shifting features of the underground continue to assemble and mutate according to their own peculiar gravity. One of the most unexpected and impressive recent formations is GHQ, a trance-folk group made up of Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogitsu), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice), and Steve Gunn (provenance unknown). Cosmology of Eye is their first official album following a typically murky history of small-batch recordings, and here the trio vividly broadcasts an astonishing selection of American primitive drone, slow-puffing acoustic strums, and elongated, dimly-lit ragas. The most immediately striking aspect about Cosmology of Eye is how dissimilar it is to Bassett and Nolan's better-known projects. Listeners familiar with either Magik Markers' spazz-rock extremism or the skull-warping mysteries of Double Leopards might initially be taken aback by the graceful, unhurried majesty of GHQ's drowsy astral maneuvers. As such, this album provides a valuable counterbalance to each musician's previous body of work, infusing their steadfast, ecstatic drone-rituals with a welcome crosscurrent of fresh oxygen. At times the patient, widescreen visions of Cosmology of Eye can seem like a deliberate reverse-image of Double Leopards' claustrophobic din, as GHQ's quiet orbits trace some of the same mystical arcs as East Coast avant-pioneers like Angus Maclise or Henry Flynt. The echoes of these visionary forebears are most evident on the opening ""Drink the Good Moon"", which layers minimalist violin scrapings over distant percussion and shadowy vocal incantations. Though Bassett's vocals are featured more prominently on the bottomless swirl of ""Drift-Void"", lucid conversation is kept to a minimum around these campfires, as everyone instead seems intent on staring at the flames, hoping to discern whatever spirit figures might rise from the ashes. The epic, loose-formed raga ""Lie, Live, Make It"" forms the bulk of the album's second side, and its repetitive, unresolvable patterns manage to simultaneously recall the celestial mantras of Popul Vuh and the primal rhythms of the Godz. Better yet is the album-closing ""Black River Apples"", which features spiraling, Sandy Bull-like strands of guitar and banjo and likely stands as the most unabashedly gorgeous music either Bassett or Nolan have ever had a hand in. Predictably, GHQ have already followed Cosmology of Eye with the full-length La Poesia Visiva CD-R on the Heavy Blossom label. On this release the trio return to the fertile climes of Cosmology of Eye, dipping again into the perpetual drone-streams that seem always to reside just out of view, extending to the horizon in every direction. If Hototogitsu, Double Leopards, and Magik Markers are sometimes able to channel the exact vibrations of an ongoing apocalypse, GHQ instead create the enlightened hymns of post-urban survivors. Time will only tell if they will eventually become as endlessly prolific as Bassett and Nolan's other groups, but for now it would appear that GHQ have momentum on their side.","Following a murky history of small-batch recordings, this is the first official album from a trance-folk group featuring Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogitsu), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice), and Steve Gunn.

Back to the Web,Elf Power,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc465e6ef95969322de8/1:1/w_160/7e259b46.jpg,2006-04-25 06:00:06,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2748-back-to-the-web/,Ryko,"Could that title be a statement of direction from Elf Power, an acknowledgment that they stumbled instead of strutted on their previous album, 2004's Walking With the Beggar Boys? Could Back to the Web represent a retreat to their Athens lair, hidden dark in the recesses of Elephant 6 psych-pop or perhaps buried deep beneath Orange Twin, the group's 150-acre land conservation project? Could this album be a dramatic regrouping, a realigning of priorities and personnel to better capture their early, hazy pop bliss? Doubtful. Certainly Back to the Web is the best and most confident Elf Power have sounded in years. The band has finally managed to integrate its 1960s folk fetish with its 70s rock jones-- two elements that are encoded in the group's collective DNA but have been squarely at odds with each other most of the time. Elf Power are doing something right, but interpreting the album title as career commentary might be giving them more credit that they deserve. For all the record's improvement on the band's sound, Elf Power remain completely unself-aware, with little to no idea of their strengths and weaknesses, which, admittedly, have shifted subtly since their last outing. Back to the Web starts strong: ""Come Lie Down with Me (and Sing My Song)"" provides a low-key yet confident introduction, with Heather McIntosh's cello carrying an elegantly subdued melody. As the opener flows into the more upbeat ""An Old Familiar Scene"", the tempo remains checked and consistent-- unfortunately, it doesn't change much at all across these dozen tracks-- the same regulated rush of sound, lead by Andrew Rieger's curiously dry vocals, on song after song. Making the most of a generally undistinguished voice, he places one syllable squarely on each beat, with minimal syncopation. Reminiscent of Donovan at his Donovanest and 60s Ren-fest pop in general, this strategy is most pronounced on the darkly pastoral ""Rolling Black Water"" and ""King of Earth"", but throughout the album, Rieger rarely leaves his vocal comfort zone or abandons his meditative, slightly detached evenness. Because he is the primary songwriter-- and because Elf Power's music has always served the lyrics-- Rieger's vocals restrain the band considerably, which seems especially unimaginative when the music sounds this nimble and emphatically evocative. With the addition of McIntosh on cello, Olivia Tremor Control's John Fernandes on violin and clarinet, Jimmy Hughes on guitar, and Josh Lott taking over drums, the lineup has expanded in interesting directions, giving the Elf even more Power. Together the band-- also including mainstays Laura Carter and bassist Brian Poole-- crafts sweeping scores for Rieger's songs, creating a psychedelic pastoral that's equally sunny and sinister. They pepper these tracks with beguiling sonic flourishes, like Julien Derocher's banjo on ""23rd Dream"" and McIntosh's cello drones adding low, ominous rumble to ""Forming"". Featuring Rieger's most lushly melodic hook and loosest vocal performance, ""Peel Back the Moon, Beware!"" is a sweetly shambling mid-album highlight, as Carter's accordion and Poole's bouncy bass dance around each other. These are moments that work despite the limitations of the album, proving the band is capable of much more than is captured on Back to the Web. Too bad the songs aren't as adventurous as the music. This lack of songwriterly imagination severely limits the band's range. ""King of Earth"" sets a tone that sounds like it's leading somewhere, but despite the layering of instruments-- mostly reeds and guitars-- it never quite fulfills its promise to burst forth dramatically, instead fading at the end with little to show for its three minutes. Even on ""Somewhere Down the River"" and the closing title track, when they try to cut loose and kick up some real noise, Elf Power sound restrained and muted. As the album progresses and each song falls into the same lockstep, the repetitiveness becomes increasingly noticeable and tiresome, and even the band's freshly enthusiastic inventiveness can't entirely disguise or alleviate it. As a result, Back to the Web becomes, very much unintentionally, an album of unresolved tensions and undeveloped builds-- not a welcoming web, but a house full of identical rooms and steep stairs that lead into blank walls.","E6 holdovers manage to integrate their 1960s folk fetish with their 70s rock jones on this Rykodisc release.

Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? EP,Arctic Monkeys,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d9b1335d7bf1698364/1:1/w_160/ecc49519.gif,2006-04-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/498-who-the-fuck-are-arctic-monkeys-ep/,Domino,"Five-song EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? is the English quartet's first new release since it became the year's most-talked-band and, oh dear, it's largely about dealing with sudden fame and its unfortunate consequences-- the obligations of touring, the demands of fans, the inevitability of backlash. This is nothing new for the Monkeys-- ""The View From the Afternoon"" kicks off their debut LP with a warning that ""Anticipation has a habit to set you up/ For disappointment in evening entertainment,"" and tellingly that's the Whatever People Say I Am... track featured here. Thesis statement laid out, half of Who the Fuck's new tracks are less about the experience of being young and bored and smartly observant, the combination that, to date, has colored their best tracks, but about the experience of being the Arctic Monkeys themselves-- still young, sometimes bored, but their vision now limited to a tour itinerary or press clippings, and unable to successfully articulate why that's so frustrating. For the listener, it's easy to spot the chief problem: Songs about the need and drive to become rock and roll stars are more powerful and interesting than the ones about the experience of being a rock and roll star-- just ask Noel Gallagher. Arctic Monkeys singer and lyricist Alex Turner-- an expressive storyteller with a keen eye for detail and a deceptively sly wit-- seems well-equipped to navigate the divide between talking as one of the kids and talking to the kids, so perhaps his stumbles are more a shell-shocked response to the speed in which they gained their fame than a fundamental flaw. The EP's defensive title track comes across as a poor decision, a dispatch from the other side of the velvet rope that moves between communicating directly with their fans (""Your heroes aren't what they seem/ When you've been where we've been"") to dismissing johnny-come-latelys to admitted bouts of paranoia. The stick to your guns/last gang in town tone of the thing is admirable-- lord knows, rock could use a bit of swagger-- but it has a bit of a ""famous last words"" quality to it, reading like that ""Declaration of Principles"" that came back to bite Charles Foster Kane in the ass. ""Despair in the Departure Lounge"" is about, you guessed it, missing your girl when you're on the road. And sure, it's a cliché, but it eventually unfolds as an unexpected gesture from a lyricist who's often guarded, reserving his empathy for his characters (and, on ""A Certain Romance"", for his could-be enemies) and putting up a front with regards to himself. The moment when the song redeems its cookie-cutter nature is its third verse, and it hits not because of what Turner says but how he says it, slowing his voice into a wobbly quiver that mimics both the haze of travel and the hallucinatory nature of the lyric (""Yesterday, I saw a girl/ Who looked like someone you might knock about with/ And almost shouted""). It's reminiscent of the aforementioned Gallagher's exhausted solo acoustic turn on Oasis B-side ""Talk Tonight"". The other two new tracks are a third-tier character sketch (""Cigarette Smoker Fiona"") and an understated ballad (""No Buses""), with the latter serving as the record's grower and most thoroughly satisfying track. So, more a reiteration of their mission statement than a new record, the hint of ferociousness and fight on the title track is a positive sign; that the band feels backed into a corner by the manner and speed in which it gained fame isn't. It would be churlish and archaic to insist in 2006 that bands drive around in a van for x number of months in order to ""earn"" success when they can efficiently and quickly cover the distance of the globe with a single mp3. (Gnarls Barkley, the UK market's other recent digital-age sensation, presumably get a free pass because they're industry vets.) If people already have their knives out for the Arctic Monkeys, the band would do best to ignore them and move on rather than address the issue itself in song. After all, the surest way to deflect backlash is to make good music.","2006's most buzzed-about band address the onset of fame and the inevitabililty of backlash on this five-song EP.

Gold Brick,Jon Langford,by: Stephen M.

Even as he continues to sharpen his chops on country and western, and U.S. folk and folk art, his disdain for particular political and social developments has only intensified and become more intractable. Rather than diluting his music, his lefty hostility has thus far mirrored the subversiveness of the musical forms he practiced, infusing albums like 2003's The Mayors of the Moon and the following year's All the Fame of Lofty Deeds with a fiery dissatisfaction and a feisty humor. All rock legends should age so gracefully. That spiritedness is all but absent on Gold Brick, a concept album of sorts about the gold and slave trades that exchanges his C&W; fixation for sea shanties and bland rock. Too many of these songs sound like obligatory run-throughs. Jettisoning the reconstructed C&W; that made Lofty Deeds such a gem, Langford has gathered a decent backing band. Only occasionally do they hint at the rabble they're capable of rousing: Pat Brennan's piano elegantly laces these songs together, and Jean Cook's violin on ""Tall Ships"" speaks more loudly and clearly about these matters than Langford's lyrics. Langford hasn't given them his best batch of songs, though. ""Buy It Now"" lazily tackles even lazier consumerism, but its slothful antigroove can't sell the message. ""Gorilla & the Maiden"" starts strong but soon loses its way as Langford muddles the melody, and ""Anything Can Happen"" proves the adage that there's nothing as boring as listening to someone else describe their dreams. The biggest disappointment is centerpiece ""Salty Dog"", a dead-in-the-water sea dirge that's just embarrassing. Langford flails as he tries to hit the high notes; worse, he never sounds like he's even in character. Gold Brick has some luster, hinting in its best moments at the album that might have been. Langford and his band put some vigor into the reggae-flavored ""Dreams of Leaving"" and the reminiscing ""Invisible Man"", almost excusing its grafted chorus. He finally gets some real fire in his voice on the closer, ""Lost in America"", which recaps American history as global farce: a confused Columbus landing on what he thinks is the West Indies, the Transcontinental Railway pulling the Great Depression behind it. But this moment, which comes too late, reveals the essential imbalance that sinks Gold Brick: Langford is navigating by politics, not by music. He has something to say, but for once in his storied career, that seems to take priority over how to say it. As a result, both the music and the message suffer.","Former Mekons leader and head Waco Brother balances his love of traditional American music and his disgust with American capitalism and consumerism.

Hokane,Aki Tsuyuko,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bf5e6ef9596932129f/1:1/w_160/95876368.jpg,2006-04-24 06:00:13,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8320-hokane/,Thrill Jockey,"Aki Tsuyuko's own music has been made in the shadow of Nobukazu Takemura, her more famous and connected collaborator. Tsuyuko first lent her quintessentially innocent vocals to his Child's View project in 1998, and many of Takemura's subsequent records featured at least one Tsuyuko contribution. Takemura's favored technique during this glitched-out phase was to take her flat, indeterminate coos and feed them into the silicon chipper, combining the skipping utterances with repeating melodic phrases heavily indebted to Steve Reich. It was a fruitful period for Takemura, yielding key tracks like ""Meteor"" and ""Kepler"", both of which would have been seriously diminished without Tsuyuko's contributions. Meanwhile, she quietly released her debut album Ongakushitsu in 1999. While Takemura's aesthetic depended heavily on software, Tsuyuko's could have come from any time since the development of the electric organ. She has acknowledged a debt to the piano music of Erik Satie, and while she shares his delicacy and understatement, her tunes are not especially melodic. Instead, they can be imagined as small musical sculptures, turning slowly in place without really going anywhere. The visual aspect of Tsuyuko's music is made explicit on this limited-run boutique release, which combines a CD of new music with a hardcover book she wrote and illustrated. The book and music are designed to work together, with a few pages of drawings, text, and musical notation devoted to each track. Musically, Hokane is of a piece with Tsuyuko's earlier release. Dynamic range is nonexistent; tracks develop according to a logic inspired by the loose patterns of nature, with melodies that could have been transcribed from a gently swaying wind chime. Though electronic organs remain central, Tsuyuko experiments with arrangement, scoring her music for flute, vibraphone, voice, and several other instruments. There is a strong similarity in timbre to Takemura's work circa Songbook, but Tsuyuko exhibits a patience and restraint that elevates the seemingly simple music to something more profound. She also transcends the easy poignancy of childhood references, opting instead for a removed formality, which provides ample distance for contemplation. The mood is tranquil, placid, and, at points, quite beautiful. Hokane is so unassuming it can very easily slip into the background, but I doubt Tsuyuko minds. Of greatest interest in the book is the inclusion of the written score to the album, with clefs integrated into watercolors of geometric figures, blurred street scenes, and so on. If you read music, you can get a sense of how Tsuyuko uses repetition by observing the notes laid out on paper, and ""seeing"" this particular album reinforces the music's ability to evoke mood and color. Still, while the book is an attractive artifact and fits well with the music, it'll probably end up on the shelf for a while after you flip through it a couple of times. The important thing is that Tsuyuko has a solid new record that builds and improves upon her debut.","Thrill Jockey solo debut from the longtime Nobukazu Takemura collaborator.

Saturday Looks Good to Me's sound is refracted through so many layers of fetish for the past, it's a wonder the time-space continuum isn't ripped every time they put out another album, teleporting Brian Wilson into medieval England or Stephin Merritt into EPCOT. Draw this timeline on a chalkboard: SLGTM clings to the prolific self-release protocol of indie pop (1980s), while attempting to recreate the childhood sensation of listening to dusty, warped 45s (70s) of pop music from the heyday of Motown and Spector (60s). It's fitting then that Saturday Looks Good to Me's productions often sound like a cassette tape that's been redubbed a few too many times. Slathered with reverb, and occasionally interrupted by broken tape head warbles, the basement music made by Fred Thomas and a cast of dozens could be written off as affected lo-fi pandering, but in the spirit of conducting a séance for the Wall of Sound, it's an appropriate approach: cramming as many elements as possible into a handful of tracks, and putting the resultant technological distortions to good use. Unless you live in or near Ann Arbor, Mich., it hasn't been easy to be a SLGTM completist-- the band has consistently bled seven-inches and tour EPs since their inception. They have often saved some of their best work for these shorter formats, which makes the Sound on Sound collection more of a highlight reel than a barrel-scrape. Swollen, yes; 30 tracks and 80 minutes is a lot to digest from any band. But its length and unity of purpose allows sufficient time to fully submerge in the band's world-- fuzzy, faded, and a little weird-smelling, like the rec-room blanket. Whether sung by Thomas' own glottal voice or someone from his extensive guest-singer Rolodex, SLGTM's songs are usually led by the next-room stomp of echo-drenched drums, no matter how much of a pocket orchestra (horns, strings, organs) is thrown on top. But this is no GBV slackery: The sleigh bells and gunshot snare of ""Lift Me Up"" emulate Motown via transistor radio with meticulous detail, while the sheepish instrumental homage ""Pet Store"" nails the far-off mono-mix percussion of the Beach Boys' ""Let's Go Away for a While"". Even when the rhythms are supplied by machines (""It Sounds Like They're in Love with You""), it's the kind of dusty technology you'd expect to find on a Magnetic Fields record, setting up a second timeline parabola stretching from synth-pop to Tin Pan Alley. As with the Merritt catalog, it sometimes seems like SLGTM's revival of outdated sonic packaging is meant to deflect cynicism toward the sickly sweet sentiments within songs like ""Summer Doesn't Count (Unless You're Here with Me)"" or ""Girl of Mine"". In a scene where earnest love songs are almost anachronistic, it only makes sense to clothe them in hand-me-down production and arrangements, even if it means sacrificing the immediate for the sake of memory mining. It's this level of remove that nips at the band's heels, even as they prove themselves capable of filling countless 7""'s with instant oldies and prom themes that never were. Sound on Sound bears testament to this consistency, while it also documents the onion layers of nostalgia that haunt Saturday Looks Good to Me to both positive and negative effect.","Fred Thomas and co. collect numerous seven-inches and tour EPs, and the result is more of a highlight reel than a barrel-scrape.

Their sound is a throwback to 1970s hard rock-- miles of galloping riffs, noodling organ, and guitar fuzz-- but what makes their self-titled debut rise above mere pastiche is how capably they strike a balance between meaty vintage metal and crisp, stoner-rock melodies. Typically, Wolfmother plays it straight, employing the raw materials of some of the original prog/metal bands signed to England's Vertigo Records during the label's 1969-71 prime: ""Colossal"" booms with heavy power chords and woozy riffing, while frontman Andrew Stockdale's crisp vocals soar through the rhythm's open spaces, while ""Woman"" is a driving, upbeat monster with spacey prog-inflected keyboards. But they also test their limits on tracks like ""The White Unicorn"". Its opening bars recall Led Zeppelin's gentler side with clean-strummed guitar chords and Stockdale putting on his best Robert Plant, but tumbling drumfills inevitably welcome back the rock, leading up to a blissed-out, psychedelic bridge. ""Where Eagles Have Been"" best spans the album's breadth: clean guitars turn dirty, organs wail during the transitions, and the slow and intense rhythm becomes upbeat and explosive just in time for the guitar solo. On ""Witchcraft"", the band evokes Jethro Tull with a Canterbury flute solo that ought to sound forced or hokey, but context is everything, and set against Wolfmother's wallop, it's a natural fit. Of course, not all their risks return rewards as worthwhile: The obnoxious three-and-a-half-minute garage-punk blast ""Apple Tree"" features the album's most uninspired songwriting and laziest delivery. Fortunately, they manage to take things out on a high note with the swampy ""Vegabond"", a track that, like much of this record's other material, authentically emulates a classic sound with the conviction and hunger of a young band on their way to finding a more singular voice.","Debut LP from the hyped Australian band, one of a handful of artists hell-bent on making heavy rock a sizable force in the 2006 musical landscape.

Open Season,Feist,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a100b1335d7bf1698158/1:1/w_160/1f5549d5.jpg,2006-04-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3315-open-season/,Arts & Crafts,"Nearly two years after its release, Leslie Feist's second solo album-- Let It Die, a sultry melange of jazz, disco, downtempo, and French pop-- is enjoying the audience it always deserved. Regardless of what poor reasons initially kept listeners at arm's length (knee-jerking because the record is roughly half-full of covers, distrust of a 2004 release from this compatriot of the then-unfashionable Peaches, a spotty solo debut), the protracted embrace is welcome, and a reminder that heady, grownup pop can attract listeners without the gentle nudges of AAA radio and Starbucks. Armed with a trio of first-tier singles-- the spritely and still underrated ""Mushaboom"", the desolate title track, and a pulsing cover of the Bees Gees' disco ballad ""Inside & Out""-- Feist has quietly become the most popular satellite in the Broken Social Scene system, one of the few members of that collective to command not only respect but admiration. With Feist touring and introducing Let It Die to new audiences even into the first few months of 2006, it's natural that early adopters are restless for a new release, a role filled this week by Open Season, a generous 15-track collection of remixes, reworkings, and collaborations released in Canada via Arts & Crafts. Unsurprisingly, the album is overrun with deconstructions of Feist's signature song-- there are four versions of ""Mushaboom""-- but it also features a cover of Peaches' ""Lovertits"", a track with Readymade FC, and a duet with Jane Birkin rescued from the latter's 2004 comeback LP Rendez-Vous. Let It Die's sparse rhythms, roomy arrangements, and seamless genre-blending make it ripe for re-tooling, so it's disappointing that so many of the reworked tracks mimic the sound and mood of their source material rather than stretch them. Feist already straddles the line of coffeetable MOR and cocktail jazz, and many of these remixes move to the wrong side of that divide: Embracing trip-hop's post-halcyon days, the aimless atmospherics of some of the tracks hint at neither post-millennial dread nor the slinky, cinematic grandeur of the genre's most effective material. Most egregious is that ""Inside & Out"", Feist's lugubrious disco tune, is denied the swirling, maximalist treatment it deserves. Its lone appearance here comes with Apostle of Hustle's ""unmix"", a stripped-down live version featuring only Jason Collett's scratchy, detuned guitar and Feist's vocals, a combination that seems mismatched. The track stutters along without providing a fluid melody for Feist to ride; fortunately she doesn't compound the problem with a melismatic or overwrought delivery, but the awkward pull between her voice and Collett's guitar never creates an interesting tension. Whether the compilation's creators were disallowed to use Ewan Pearson's two remixes of the track-- one a club burner, the other a waterlogged dub-- or left them off because it was feared they wouldn't mesh with the rest of the material, their omissions are unfortunate. A few official remixes do make appearances here-- including both Mocky and VV (the French electronic duo and frequent Feist compatriots, not the Kills leader) taking cracks at ""Mushaboom"", with both versions earning passing grades. Canadian emcee k-Os and the Postal Service also work over the track, each unable to resist adding their own vocals. The former massages the arrangement, but his precise, clipped vocals are less compelling than the languid, stream-of-consciousness raps that once successfully colored Massive Attack and Mo'Wax tracks. The Postal Service mix sounds like, well, the Postal Service-- low-whirring synths, a gently skipping rhythm, and Ben Gibbard's cozy vocals auditioning for the role of Feist's ""man to stick it out/ Make a home from a rented house."" And, who'd have thought, three years removed from the Give Up LP, the Postal Service template is still an oddly welcome combination. Other highlights here come via the tracks that weren't as central to Let It Die-- an oddly hypnotic, 90s-retro version of ""Lonely Lonely"", VV's take on ""One Evening"", and the Birkin collaboration. Feist's spirited, democratic approach-- sharing space with friends on both her recordings and theirs, slipping easily to an vocal interpreter's role on covers, this remix album-- is delightfully loose, resulting in the sort of embraceable sound that her more well-known collective ran from on its overcooked self-titled album. Throughout it all, she's also managed to stamp an identity on her work, one that, if anything, is too dominant here. A more adventurous and well-rounded cast of collaborators-- a few more names from outside of her trusted circle-- may have enlivened the record, as Pearson did to ""Inside & Out"". Instead, it's a grab bag of more of the same, serving only to again spotlight the strengths we'd already located in these songs.",,6.6,
Tum,The Impossible Shapes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95d9d034d5c69bf51e1/1:1/w_160/aac4cfe3.jpg,2006-04-23 06:00:19,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4088-tum/,Secretly Canadian,"Tum, originally issued as a limited edition LP a few months before the release of the Impossible Shapes' 2005 album Horus, is subtle, cleanly splitting the difference between poppy folk and psychedelia. But while Tum's patchwork of thickly melodic snippets is consistently fine, its evenhandedness skews toward anonymity. Tum obscures its memorable pop melodies with psychedelic tweaks too staid to be truly freaky. The result is an album that sounds good while it's playing, but leaves little of an impression behind. While consistently maintaining a lo-fi, Elephant 6 vibe that sits well amid the affectedly naturalistic freakfolk of today, each Impossible Shapes album has varied slightly in overarching style. Tum is characterized by a stark duality. On the lion's share of its songs, coruscating organs and gossamer guitars create deep, shifting fields of color; against this backdrop, twangy acoustic leads-- supple, vaguely Far Eastern arpeggios-- trace out brittle tangles. Rooted in this dynamic, the plosive ""Pixie Pride"" seems to respire, with corkscrewing electric leads punching rents in its weepy facade. The opening accordion wheeze of ""Fulgent Fields"" harrumphs toward a clean, bright lead; it's one of the few songs on this largely static record with significant structural variation. ""Late Summer Sky"", with its lysergic vocal harmonies and lapidary guitar flecks, typifies the record's brassy/murky aesthetic, and songs like ""Tahuti, Splendid Scribe"", with its gently ramshackle aspect, resonate with the music of the Jeweled Antler Collective. But Tum is more memorable when it bends away from this gauzy style and toward more strident tones, during moments when the idyll darkens: On ""Little Gloves"", maniacal strings stab at the air, then settle into a creaky, seasick lurch that gradually slows to a funerary march, organs bleating defeat. The psychedelic touches are pleasant but tired, borrowing from Beefheart and Zappa with little revision. Backwards tape is deployed liberally: The antic ""The Working Vessel"" rewinds individual notes over a plunky lead and a stiff two-note bassline; the backwards drums of ""Hathor"" produce a sense of viscous suction; the Banhartesque, hippy-dippy cruncher ""Willow Willow Yew"" doubles back on itself to yowl into oblivion. We get jittery, atonal piano on ""Ra in the Rising""; hard-panned vocals on the crispy garage boogie ""Florida Silver Springs""; dirty bass and squealing organs on the wiggy ""Hornbeam""; unreliable tempos on the rambling ""Twisted Sol Epoch"". What we don't get is any real sense of adventure or melodies sturdy enough to carry around. This noncommittal nature doesn't ruin Tum, but in a musical climate already teeming with slightly deranged pastoralia, it doesn't distinguish it either.","Originally issued in a limited run prior to the 2005 album Horus, this subtle psych-folk LP is given a wider release by Secretly Canadian.

Expressions (2012 A.U.),Dudley Perkins,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a167c0084474cd0bfdd7/1:1/w_160/3acec14d.gif,2006-04-23 06:00:18,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6526-expressions-2012-au/,Stones Throw,"When opened in iTunes, resident Stones Throw croonfish Dudley Perkins' new album, his second, is labeled as ""jazz."" These sly misnomers are common, where cheeky artists or fans throw up unconnected genres as a cheap, easy joke on the consumer. (Slipknot = Blues, hilarious!) When I first noticed the tag on Dudley's new LP, I thought Madlib and co. were goofing, considering Perkins is a funk/soul singer; on Expressions, Perkins' impressionistic Ella Fitzgerald-style note-hanging makes that a little more believable. But where traditional jazz singers are focused chaos-- whether whirling through bustling percussion or slow-burning through low-down bass lines-- Perkins' bleary-eyed style is pure, unfettered slop. He hangs, sure, but it's plain to see he has neither formal training nor any idea that he's stretching out the syllables this goofily. Still, he finds ways to make it work. Expressions is an improvement over his improbably existent debut, A Lil' Light, the work of a man with no idea how to write lyrics-- let alone songs. Not that he carted his horse to any sort of Leonard Cohen wagon; his tracks still amble, amiably. But producer Madlib has taken his ever-present penchant for fractured soul production-- sample-heavy organs and wah guitar sound-- to a slipshod breaking point here, a place where choruses are worthless and verses are for chumps. Perkins' debut was almost entirely choruses; eliminating his formulaic writing, Dudley's meandering here sounds more naturalistic. ""Separate Ways"" is droopy and shimmering at once, with a high-pitched synth punctuating the ramble-sanging: ""Sweet memories of you and me down a one-way road,"" then a bit of scat-talking, then an informal coda. ""Coming Home"" could be about returning to a lover, returning to God or just, ya know, a trip home from the weedspot. Thing is, it's as much about existential terror. Dudley's shook. You can't name a song ""Dear God"" unless you really mean it, no matter how funny it is. ""Dollar Bill"" is predictably about an eternal lack of funds. Even rollicking opener ""Funky Dudley"" has an insecure call-and-response thing happening: ""How'd you get so funky, Dudley?"" Dudley tells us ""whatever it takes to get the body to move,"" but he's only half-right. Only the clipped, pseudo-Parliament groove lets us forgive him his bragging and thoughtless proclamations. There was a time when Dudley (initially known as the West Coast MC Declaime) was compared to the late prankster/genius Wesley Willis on this site. Lyrically, he's just not as funny or insistently bizarre as Willis. He ain't half the singer, either. But his personas (unlucky-in-love drunk, weeded-out couch-dweller, broke-ass God-fearer) offer a vulnerability often missing from most earthy nu-soul artists. It's only natural that Madlib and P.B. Wolf jumped at the chance to record Dudley's first full-length when the overrated 7"" ""Flowers"" dropped in late 2002. Stones Throw's aesthetic demanded a warbly crooner, especially post-Nigga Please. In Dudley, they've got one, and now he's a growing artist, one without either traditional talent or pretension. He's just a singer that sings because he's got to. There's no other way to shake the demons-- or tell his chick he's sorry.","Stones Throw's resident bleary-eyed soulman takes welcome strides on this Madlib-produced LP.

Second Guessing,Oakley Hall,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba419d034d5c69bf540f/1:1/w_160/96993e08.gif,2006-04-23 06:00:17,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6099-second-guessing/,Amish,"Oakley Hall's second album is an unencumbered affair that pulls the same trick as other sophomore-slump trumps-- R.E.M.'s Reckoning, perhaps, or Talking Heads' More Songs About Buildings And Food-- by doing what the band does best, and doing it quickly. The record lacks the attention to detail that marked Oakley Hall's self-titled debut, but it makes up the difference by distilling the band's sound to its most engaging elements. The Hall are led by former Oneida guitarist Pat Sullivan (aka Papa Crazee), who applies his former band's studied patience and fearless blending of genre to Oakley Hall's rustic sound. Second Guessing revels in the clichés of country and stretches them, like a perpetual jam session that never loses its focus or energy. They're the perfect antidote for dabbling rock fans who ""only like real country, like Johnny Cash,"" or a revelation to those who thought Neil Young's ""Down by the River"" was too short. Even with their jam-tastic approach, Second Guessing is still plenty palatable. It effortlessly merges a sincere love of country-rock with a band that gets restless easily. There's always a drumbeat quickening the pulse or a tasteful guitar solo carrying the listener from one section to the next. They make the gutsy choice of opening on their longest track, ""Hiway"", with a dirty, distorted guitar that runs underneath it, and the automotive love song ""Eyes, Lock, and Steel"", cements Oakley Hall as scruffy miscreants-- even as Sullivan and lead singer Rachel Cox belt out harmonies like true professionals. The creaky vocal to the slower, squeakier ""Adalina Roselma Lapage"" almost falls from its hinges, with comically spiteful lyrics (""she makes me feel like a high school kid/ High school sucked"") and a protagonist who yearns to be ""any other place but lookin' at your dome."" It's a highlight that incorporates the band's offbeat charm without losing their earnestness. They show off their wistful side later in the album with ""Mumbles"", rage against the Man in ""Landlord"", and grow party-weary despite the energetic pace of ""Volume Rambler"". The risk of this approach is that without much variation or any huge standout tracks, the mood gets monochromatic. The record remains remarkably consistent, however, and with their third record, Gypsum Strings, due in June, maybe Oakley Hall have already widened past the rural-highway tunnel vision of Second Guessing.","On its second album of country-fried rock, the once more detail-oriented indie band distills its sound to its most engaging elements.

Drowaton,Starlight Mints,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54513d1975652138ee6/1:1/w_160/8c328f2b.jpg,2006-04-23 06:00:16,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7468-drowaton/,Barsuk,"Oh, come on. I dig the Lips, too, but for this Oklahoma band to furnish its third album of sun-warped indie pop with such a referential cover is a conceit-- especially since the bands hardly sound alike. Starlight Mints singer Allen Vest's fey vocals more closely channel Ray Davies in the Kinks' more ambitious moments, when the UK's most ingratiating songwriter was at his least chummy and most conductorly. Vest hovers nearest the Lips' Wayne Coyne when he loiters in an unconvincing falsetto, but his update conveys less power because he's reluctant to sing out. Had these Candyland denizens orchestrated opener ""Pumpkin"" less busily-- without the wailing wall-of-sound brass, and with more breathing room for the vocals-- Vest's high notes would've carried more beauty. Instead, he becomes a bit player in a boldly decorous milieu. Imagine Phil Spector-era Beatles without John Lennon's messianic gravitas and you have a good (albeit generous) impression of Drowaton. To pull off compelling rococo you've got to weep with every brushstroke, ornament your songs with floor-to-ceiling detail in supplication to god because nothing less will do, and unless everyone's left naked and penniless afterward your shit ain't worth the pilgrimage. As ornate orchestral pop goes, Starlight Mints are too oddball-flip. They cram their songs with every sound imaginable without making a compelling case for any, and music that's so congested needs a sense of hierarchy. They seem mortified of silence and attempt to fashion, from a dab of fuzz guitar or a dusting of rhodes piano, an unnecessary instrumental hinge for every transition. Drowaton's best songs are notable for what they don't do. ""What's Inside of Me?"" doesn't let excessive adornment get in the way of its album-best chorus. When Vest reveals, ""I just want the world to see/ What's inside of me,"" in one of the album's rare long-faced moments, it's a refreshing change-up from Starlight Mints' usual goofiness. ""Pearl's (Submarine #2)"", meanwhile, resists over-variegating its instrumentation to focus instead on variations on one instrument, the guitar. The song deploys several of them at different volumes and levels of distortion; a muted slide-bent version, deriving wondrous warmth from a vintage-sounding tube amp, barely stays long enough for coffee but takes top prize with a sinuous line. And ""Rhino Stomp"" sacrifices vocals in exchange for the cinematic excess lacking elsewhere. Although the song bites ""I Am The Walrus""'s pizzicato plod and invocation of fat, gray animals harder than Drowaton's cover does the Flaming Lips, its booming conviction offers a blueprint for the Mints to follow on future outings. After the good comes the unfortunate-- songs that hold promise but find little success because the band is so overzealous with its seasonings. The title track bristles with at least 29 string sounds, 14 of which have not yet been catalogued by biologists, making its dusk-creeps-in slinkiness a humid, mysterious affair, but I wish the band had dwelt longer on the interplay of drums and tension-building radar pulses. ""Rosemarie""'s problems stem more from gag-me-with-a-spoon Beatles worship than overproduction, and those MIDI trumpets are pretty awesome, but the song would still cut a more fetching silhouette if it shed a few layers. At moments like these it'd be nice if the band's appreciation for the Flaming Lips-- a band that understands the value of rough edges-- translated into their music, as well as their artwork.","Barsuk issues the third album from Oklahoma's other orchestral psych-pop band.

We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,Bruce Springsteen,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64ec0084474cd0c0924/1:1/w_160/045aa13e.jpg,2006-04-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7729-we-shall-overcome-the-seeger-sessions/,Sony,"On paper, The Seeger Sessions seems like a terrible idea: traditional American folksongs paid hyper-reverent homage by one of rock'n'roll's most earnest performers, an attempt to transform campfire songs into sermons and anoint sweet, old, cord-cutting Pete Seeger high priest of Americana. Instead, this collection-- consisting of songs Seeger has sung, but none he's written-- is a boisterous, spirit-raising throwdown, conjured by a 12-man band (guitar, harmonica, tuba, violin, B3 organ, upright bass, banjo, piano, drums, accordion, trombone, saxophone, trumpet, and more) and a pack of grinning backup singers. Perhaps ironically, Bruce Springsteen-- one of America's most-adored songsmiths-- is soaring high on a record full of tracks other people wrote. On The Seeger Sessions, Springsteen growls, warbles, groans, and gags, sounding often like Tom Waits (check the scratchy, ominous vocals on ""Erie Canal"") or later Bob Dylan. It's a stark contrast to Seeger's crisp, clear pipes, and it reinvigorates a handful of ancient American tracks. Like any good folk record, The Seeger Sessions tackles the tangle of war, strife, poverty, and unrest, but does so without sacrificing joy or release (really, the very reasons people began singing in the first place). The resulting collection happily drowns out echoes of Springsteen's underwhelming recent efforts, and just might be the very best and most inspiring album Bruce has produced in more than a decade*.* Embracing early E Street shuffle and ditching the solemnity of 2005's Devils and Dust, The Seeger Sessions culls from a century of rich, gritty Americana tradition, from bluegrass to country to rhythm and blues to gospel, rock'n'roll, Zydeco, Dixieland, and more. Springsteen is an obvious descendent of folk tradition, but, as he writes in the record's liner notes, this is ""street corner music, parlor music, tavern music, wilderness music, circus music, church music, gutter music."" Or: The Seeger Sessions is a party record. Clawing through Seeger's considerable catalogue, Springsteen ultimately selected a smart, varied, and cohesive smattering of songs, proving he retains a deep and nuanced understanding of folk tradition. In a recent New Yorker profile of Seeger, Springsteen talks about folk songs as tools with potential to become ""righteous implements when connected to historical consciousness,"" and claims to have chosen this particular repertoire because, ""Everything I wanted, I found there."" Appropriately, Spingsteen's voice seems custom-made for tracks like ""We Shall Overcome"", where his signature gravity spreads shivers, destined to silence even the most jaded listeners with its convincing optimism. Written in 1905, ""Erie Canal"" (sealed comfortably in the consciousness of any kid born or raised in western New York), is ominous and hypnotizing, with banjo picks punctuated by organs, strings, and an unexpected Dixieland breakdown midway through-- it's not hard to imagine whole arenas shouting, ""Low bridge, everybody down!"" The gorgeously explosive ""O Mary Don't You Weep"" cracks open with teasing fiddles, before horns and drums kick up and Springsteen's throaty shouts are rounded out by a bevy of backing singers, organs sliding in and out, a gloriously sloppy mélange of sound, as indebted to New Orleans as it is to Newport. Springteen's voice is gravelly and real, happily divorced from the overproduction and studio tweaking that plagues his recent work, and perfectly in sync with his band's raucous, gleeful pounding. Everyone here is loose and intoxicated, and nowhere else is the record's quasi-live conceit (the record was made in three day-long sessions, preceded by no rehearsals) as gloriously palpable. Springsteen has a habit of folding current events into his songs without ever being specific enough to limit a verse to a single time and place. Unsurprisingly, that timelessness syncs up perfectly with the centuries-old songs on The Seeger Sessions, and, if nothing else, confirms that Bruce Springsteen was the right (and maybe only) person for this particular gig. Less an exhumation than a celebration, The Seeger Sessions is the best proof we've got that America's folksongs are also our finest artifacts. It's all here: recipes, prayers, promises, fears, hopes, and hollers.","A boisterous, spirit-raising throwdown on which the Boss tackles the tangle of war, strife, poverty, and unrest without sacrificing joy or release.

Imagine deconstructed Essential Logic aerosol burns (stuff that barely hung together in the first place!) with kazoo instead of horns or Beefheart played by Nautical Almanac. Mid-set with the aforementioned Nautical Almanac in 2005, a friend leaned over and said: ""Too free for me, man."" Live at No Fun, I had the same thought for Fat Worm: no forward momentum, not much to grab. Only when I turned and started doing something else (drinking? talking?) could I start to follow. Same with the record-- in the background, Pregnant Babies Pregnant With Pregnant Babies sounds its addled best, like on ""Cicadas"", light on the pointless snare work and heavy on feedback insect calls and crunchy leaves under foot. Front and center, odds are your roommates will start yelling at you: ""Dude, what the fuck is that?"" or ""Yeah, I actually lived with one of those guys. Stuff is terrible."" Pregnant Babies spends most of its time in between songs, but when they deign to appear they're sticky third-eye narrative thrillers: ""Red Melting Plastic Box"", for instance, is a story about a picnic gone wrong, honey and ants everywhere; they take over a lunch box and live there. That transitions into ""Laissez-Faire Is for the Birds"", in which pigeons come in, ruin the party, kill the ants, eat all the bread, and ride nature's chaos (gurgles, bird chirps, chords and choruses, the odd harmony) into triumph over mankind. ""Brown"" and ""Hand of God"" make some sense, too: The former basically is a class rant (""she's so sophisticated, get it?""), and the latter's your standard anti-Christ or whoever (""the skin of God is dry and flaking"") song, set to pick and string drags. Fat Worm of Error have a couple people who used to play in Deerhoof, and they've developed their own version of that band's unpredictability and kiddie-moan, except here set in Western Massachusetts and devoid of the presumption of an audience. Like kids, their alternate universe is addictive when you're in it.

Joyner has released eight albums since his 1993 debut, with each record surrounded by a veritable constellation of singles and compilation tracks, the kind of thing that creates nightmares for fans who don't live in places where all those scatterlings are procurable. With Beautiful Losers, that nightmare is over, as it draws together more than an hour's worth of non-album tracks and sweepings from the cutting room-- 21 songs in all. The compilation doesn't bother with chronology, instead sequencing for flow, drawing all of its songs from the 1994-1999 span when Joyner was at his most prolific. As such, it predates what to my ears is his masterpiece, 2001's Hotel Lives, though it offers plenty of hints of that record's bleak, ramshackle sound. The album also exhibits a decent amount of variety-- it features heart-pounding, hyperactive folk fingerpicking, melodic dirges, hard-strummed laments, and even a few passing stabs at rock. As one might expect, the last of those rank among the disc's worst moments, and the absolutely nadir is undoubtedly ""Judas Blues"", a lo-fi garage number too covered in crust to be punchy, too poorly sung to be catchy and too ineptly played to actually rock. There are a few other songs on which Joyner's singing is just a bit too ragged to effectively convey the tune, resulting in melodies that are more implied than real. ""Swing"" is a pretty prime example of this, where Joyner's croak doesn't even rise close to a croon, and it's hard to tell even where he thought the melody was going. So they're not all diamonds, but they're not all lumps of coal either. There are even a few genuine surprises, like ""R Is for Riot"", a speedy, drum-led tune on which Joyner effectively and quickly strings his words together with a tumbling melody, as the Velvet Underground also sometimes did. Townes Van Zandt and Will Oldham, however, are closer reference points on most of the rest of the disc, such as ""Love Is Worth Suffering For"" and ""I Would Not Try to Break Ties With Me""-- the latter manages to juxtapose the sound of romantic dejection with suburban imagery like ""the girls at the Clip 'n' Curl are talking about a man/ With a rose in his coat/ And your name on the stem."" The real jewel of the compilation, though, is ""Milk"", with forcefully strummed acoustic guitar creating a frenzied atmosphere that sends lyrics like ""This is not a song/ This is just one of those vivid dreams...sometimes I wake up in the darkness when I should have stayed asleep"" straight home and plays to his vocal strengths. It's a great song that any Joyner fan should hear. Joyner fans are about the only ones who should hear much of the rest of this disc, though, which is basically par for a rarities collection. Everyone else can check out Hotel Lives or the Lousy Dance and leave it at that.","Subtitled Singles and Compilation Tracks 1994-1999, this Jagjaguwar collection features hyperactive fingerpicking, melodic dirges, hard-strummed laments, and even a few passing stabs at rock.

Take Miles Davis. Or Madlib. Over the past 14 years, the West Coast's most eccentric indie-rap producer has rarely slowed down long enough to undergo careful examination, causing a welcome glut that continues with this 35-track, hour-long instrumentals album. Listening to his fractured, prolific output-- from the outer space splatters of Lord Quas or the loose jazz of Yesterday's New Quintet to collabos like Madvillain's scratched soul or Jaylib's supple club detonations-- is a trip through his clouded cerebrum with the windows up and the headlights dim. Culled from his extensive collection of records, Madlib's first official beats CD offers the most comprehensive study of where the producer has been and-- with previews of in-progress tracks for upcoming projects, including Madvillain 2-- where he's going. As much a peek into a genius' process as a tutorial for dust-bin sneezers looking for the perfect beat, Beat Konducta displays Madlib's unrivaled knack for searching out oddities with a magnificently skewed ear. Floating his blurry drums over everything from fart-skronk bass to strong strings to tremulous keys, the beats forge continuity through layers of unsullied samples and enough vinyl hiss to scare an alley cat. Conceptually based on vintage library records containing stock sound, each track on Beat Konducta is parenthetically labeled with a title and a mood. With emcees reduced to short snippets (Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., and ODB are all paid second-hand tribute), the instrumentals are granted space to mess about and they offer enough fuzzy fodder for listeners to conjure their own jumbles. Various alter egos make unmarked cameos, like when the spirit of Quasimoto comes down on ""Face the Sun (Africa),"" its bitchy brew marked by a stumbling bassy gait. Or ""Sir Bang (Bounce)"", which could have easily found a home on the strip-club friendly Jaylib album. And Yesterday's New Quintet vibes infiltrate the D'Angelo-sampling ""Pyramids (Change)"", which doubles as an appealing demo for the neo/lost soul if he should ever once again come out of hiding. But, more often than not, Beat Konducta finds the producer in Madvillainy mode, offering shifty-eyed funk soliloquies with the help of Diana Ross, whose ""Keep an Eye"" gives ""Friends (Foes)"" its paranoid core, or Little Anthony & the Imperials, whose ""Help Me Find a Way (To Say I Love You)"" is given a light hip-hop dusting on ""The Comeup (Come Down)"". Though Madlib's restless joi de vivre keeps Beat Konducta moving at a quick clip-- most tracks last between one and two minutes with tweaks and myriad minor samples zipping by every few seconds-- the lack of MC firepower considerably limits its real-life enjoyability. But the fact that the album is listenable at all is a testament to Madlib's undeniable skills as a hip-hop visionary, expanding the essence with appealing, tarnished grit. In an interview with XLR8R magazine in 2003, when asked about his future aspirations, Madlib responded, ""Do...every type of music. All types of black art that there is, I'm going to try to do."" As this unmistakable beat CD shows, he's well on his way to that goal.","The eccentric producer's welcome glut of releases continues with this 35-track, hour-long instrumentals album.

Booka Shade's ""Mandarine Girl"", issued last May, announced a paradigm shift, its sheets of noise and spiralling synth riffs reaching out to both the most stentorian minimal and the most epic trance. Other artists have followed in the duo's wake, crafting records that perversely treat ""minimal"" as a license to create grooves of impossible largesse. In the process, Get Physical has become a byword for arty-but-populist records with crossover potential-- from one genre enclave to another and from cult status to mass consumption. Booka Shade are perfectly placed to capitalize on this unexpected ubiquity, and while their 2004 debut Memento surprised many with its noirish, claustrophobic vibe, Movements is the gregarious corrective: not only the better record, but friendlier, larger, and more epochal in its survey of the varied delights of German house and techno. And at times it does feel like a survey, moving from rumbling Metro Area disco (""Night Falls"") to fluttering Isolée falter-funk (""The Birds and the Beats"") to beautiful Kompakt techno-pop (""Wasting Time"") with an unselfconscious grace the belies the album's range. If Get Physical increasingly resembles early Warp in its elevation of club dynamics to a steely artform, Movements might be its equivalent of LFO's Frequencies-- a record whose state of the art grooves were equally suited to sweaty dancefloors and the close intimacy of headphones. Indeed, while some grooves are more physical than others, everything about Movements seems deliberately designed to subvert the usual inverse relationship between a dance record's club-readiness and home-friendliness: ""Darko"" might boast heart-tugging synth melodies worthy of Boards of Canada, but its cavernous, bass-heavy production begs to be showcased over huge speakers in a rammed warehouse. Likewise, the duo's ""interpretation"" of ""Body Language"", their 2005 hit with M.A.N.D.Y., begins with a meandering guitar and reggae lilt intro perversely playing cat and mouse with a mnemonic bassline hook, but it soon builds into a sultry house groove whose brazen physicality leaves the original resembling a wallflower. But Booka Shade's dab hand with a groove should hardly surprise-- after all, as backroom producers for DJ T and M.A.N.D.Y., they've been partly responsible for most of the music on the most reliable dance music label of the past four years. Rather, it's the unexpected emotive quality to the music on Movements that entrances. ""In White Rooms"", the album's simplest moment, is also its best: A succession of ascending trance-like riffs over a straightforward house groove, with no other purpose than to lay claim to your heart and your tear-ducts. It feels intensely nostalgic, even if, like me, you're too young and/or too far from Germany to actually appreciate its evocation of early 90s trance parties. The nostalgia is not merely for a particular sound or moment, but for the youthful conviction that music can change the world, can change us, merely by its astonishing power and newness. But I swear there is a moment only 30 seconds before the end of this (rather cruelly foreshortened) track where it feels like the duo are actually inventing new emotionsÉso maybe their nostalgia is premature. Booka Shade will never achieve the auteur status of figures like Ricardo Villalobos, and I suspect they prefer it that way-- after all, these are the guys who ghost-produce records for their labelmates, and make their money from writing nifty tunes for commercials. Rather than seduce with ostentatious artistry, what they offer is a superlative functionalism: Dance music so perfect it can't help but move you.","The flagship act on Berlin-based Get Physical-- which increasingly resembles early Warp in its elevation of club dynamics to a steely artform-- offers an epochal survey of the varied delights of German house and techno.

"The Capitol Albums, Vol. 2",The Beatles,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a445ea9e61561daa4e7f/1:1/w_160/3a5421b8.jpg,2006-04-20 06:00:20,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1096-the-capitol-albums-vol-2/,Capitol,"I admit it. I was a little harsh on these guys the first time around. It's not that I hate the Beatles. However, in 2006, after Paul has finally had his way with Let It Be, we've been given three helpings of Anthology leftovers, half the band is dead, Bob Spitz's recent thousand-page Beatles biography moves the band a step closer to trumping Jesus' wordcount, and it appears we're starting to run out of bands obviously ripping them off, I'm a little tired of them. I grew up on this stuff, mind you; countless hours of propping my head up in front of my mom's old record player listening to worn copies of Abbey Road and the White Album, dialing 1-800-BEATLES in the blind hope that someone would answer (and they did: it was a Beatles Convention hotline), drawing pictures of fake bands who just happened to have an acoustic phase in the mid-60s. And I'm spent: the records are in my bones, so I'm rarely urged to play them. Thing is, for better or worse, the Beatles either invented or popularized almost every rock artist cliché. The notion of bands having separate and distinct creative phases, of band members having different (but essential) roles and personalities, of wives being the villains, of the solo record being an ego trip, of clean, linear emotional/musical/spiritual progression-- maybe it didn't take the Beatles to let journalists and fans indulge in their obsessive (and usually myopic) tendencies, but it sure helped. And now, as the environments they created have become the content of our pop culture historical fiction, they seem just a bit removed from reality. Indeed, even as they convert new fans every year, the Beatles are history-- not quite ancient, but decidedly of another era. Of course, I wouldn't relish explaining this to someone who might have been around while all of it was going down. I can only imagine the kind of emotional indentures this band must have made on American kids in 1964-- and not just the fawning, screaming ones, but the ones watching culture bend and stretch before their eyes. Hell, even the jaded music critics writing about how the Beatles are history would never have been given the column space were it not for the old mania and fallout (such that now, rock = Stuff to Take Seriously). The early Capitol Beatles records are funny in the respect that for such a momentous happening, they were remarkably shrewdly (and many would argue, hastily) compiled and released. It didn't stop millions of people from falling in love; to see it happen would doubtlessly have been thrilling, but now we look at things with all kinds of distance. Capitol's second box set of LPs features all four (!) Beatles albums released in America in 1965: The Early Beatles, *Beatles VI, *Help!**, and Rubber Soul. All of the records are presented in both mono and stereo, which should be an exciting prospect for fans accustomed to hearing only mono versions of most of the early Beatles songs-- though beware, apparently the first pressing of the box contains incorrect mono mixes of Beatles VI and Rubber Soul. Capitol is supposed have addressed this on pressings after the first run. Nevertheless, most of this stuff has never been on CD, and I probably don't need to convince any diehard fans to run out and hear it. The sound is uniformly good (despite the mono mastering demi-fiasco), and if you don't mind that many of the stereo mixes essentially amount to vocals on left, instruments on right, these remasters represent the clearest, cleanest versions of most of these songs. Also, if you're curious, the American records were actually mixed slightly differently than the UK ones (more echo on the vocals here, a false start there), so if some of the songs seem a little different, they are. Of course, this set is probably aimed squarely at collectors and the very nostalgic anyway, so no need to feel like a shamed Beatle fan for not buying it as soon as you see it. The Early Beatles contains songs that originally appeared on the EMI's Please Please Me from 1963, but resequenced and missing three tunes (of which ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is the most notable). This record was actually released a couple of years after the Beatles' American debut, Introducing...The Beatles, which had been put out by Vee-Jay Records. Capitol later acquired the rights to the band's catalog, and put this out in 1965. Given the hysteria at the time, I'm guessing many fans didn't care. It's hard to argue with 100% proof pop like ""Please Please Me"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?"", or ""P.S. I Love You"", though I've always thought it was weird that Ringo sung ""Boys"". Covers like ""Anna (Go to Him)"" and ""A Taste of Honey"" are more than serviceable, though the real attraction is John Lennon's famed larynx shredding take on ""Twist And Shout"". Beatles VI contains songs appearing elsewhere on the EMI albums Beatles For Sale and Help!. It's an odd mix of raucous covers (""Kansas City"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"", ""Bad Boy"") and more low-key stuff forecasting their move into more sophisticated territory (""Tell Me What You See"", the excellent ""Every Little Thing""). This guarantees a schizophrenic album experience, though the quality of the new Beatles originals probably gave fans at the time an awful lot to be happy about. Nevertheless, VI (unbelievably, the band's sixth American LP in less than two years) lives up to many a Beatle fanatic's claim of being the band's worst Capitol album. As with the band's UK albums, Help! is where things start to get really interesting. Most fans claim this is because the band was starting to open up to folk music, drugs, and relishing their own eclecticism. Of course, the American version of Help! is made all the more bizarre by including some Ken Thorne-composed incidental music from the Beatles' second movie. So, in between such classics as ""Ticket to Ride"" and the title track, you get James Bond riffs, Hitchcock strings, and a sitar-laden take on ""A Hard Day's Night"". God knows what fans thought at the time, though again, the new songs were such a leap beyond what the band was doing before, it's hard to see how anyone could have been disappointed. Recognizing the Beatles' shift in sound, Capitol emphasized the acoustic leanings of the band on its version of Rubber Soul. Leading off with ""I've Just Seen a Face"" (one of the great underrated McCartney tunes), and hitting most of the UK version of the record, the band served notice to anyone even halfway listening that they wouldn't be settling for mop-top glory. I doubt I need to say much about the best parts of Rubber Soul; the resequencing isn't as brutal here as on other Capitol albums, though ""It's Only Love"" (originally on the UK Help!) doesn't quite fit the mood. So: Four decent-to-really-good records with great sound for which most people born after 1965 will have limited need. At the very least, I enjoy hearing these songs in a slightly different light than I'm accustomed, though I wonder how long the band and its various business partners will be able to count on fans' interest in almost-as-good-as-new product. As I write this, the powers that be are said to be working on making their entire remastered catalog available via download, so perhaps the smart money is on the Beatles hanging around a while.","Capitol's second box set of LPs features all four (!)

Body Stories,Shoplifting,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6dab1335d7bf1698f0b/1:1/w_160/fe8ed2b6.jpg,2006-04-19 06:00:29,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7854-body-stories/,Kill Rock Stars,"Though there have been a few exceptions-- consistently excellent releases on Sub Pop, the Blood Brothers, Pretty Girls Make Graves-- Seattle has struggled to maintain its reputation as a hot bed of musical activity in the U.S. in recent years. Thankfully, with the rise of bands such as the ephemeral yet superb Chromatics, the city's music community began to reenergize-- particularly the political and radical DIY scene, which has evolved to embrace wider circles thanks to all-ages venues, active organization of protests such as Bands Against Bush, and a continual stream of exciting new groups. After Chromatics disbanded, three of their members-- drummer Hannah Blilie (also of the Gossip), bassist Michelle Nolan, and guitarist Devin Welch-- formed Shoplifting at the tail end of 2002. Once teamed up with vocalist/guitarist Chris Pugmire, the group committed itself to continuing its involvement and support of Seattle's punk rock community, as well as embarking on a slew of basement shows and tours alongside likeminded groups such as Erase Errata and King Cobra. As a live band, Shoplifting are a shattering, approachable, soulful, and energetic proposition, and these qualities make their debut full length, Body Stories, feel like a bolt of fiery and inspiring positivity. Shoplifting's exploration and communication of feminist, queer, and gender politics are processed via their expansive, abrasive songs, which kick and jostle like a young buck shaking dirt off its back. Bilile's drumming usually keeps things on the danceable side with driving tempos that recall the explosive punk of (the now sadly defunct) Black Eyes. Opening track ""M. Sally"" begins with a beautifully glittering guitar effect that weaves between Pugmire's tale of a woman-- perhaps a muse, perhaps a guardian-- named Mustang Sally, who protects him in times of need. Never ones to repeat a formula, Shoplifting blend tracks such as the upfront pop of ""Male Gynecology"" with instrumental semi-improvisations like ""Flying Factory""-- a furious, rhythm heavy soundscape which sounds great thanks to renowned producer Steve Fisk, who captures the band's live energy with extraordinary sensitivity. Body Stories is an idiosyncratic and musically smart album. It actually sounds as though each member is pushing themselves as far as possible with their instruments and approach to composition, and the result is captivating. Although Pugmire takes on most of the vocal responsibilities, Bilile's singing on closing track ""Claude Glass"" is easily one of the record's highlights. Haunting and unusual, spilling over the prowling bass lines and discordant guitar, she weaves dark and uncertain images with fluctuating melodies and tones, before the song collapses into its bittersweet and sudden end.","KRS band are a part of Seattle's re-energized political and radical DIY cultural scene.

Genki Shock!,Shonen Knife,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e313d1975652138bb7/1:1/w_160/f570f0ee.gif,2006-04-19 06:00:28,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7130-genki-shock/,OglioGlue Factory,"Support from rock luminaries such as Nirvana, Calvin Johnson, and Sonic Youth has been an immense help for Osaka cult band Shonen Knife, forging a link between the U.S. and Japanese pop undergrounds while bringing the band's perky, sugarcoated punk/pop to a wider audience. But over the past 25 years, singer/songwriter Naoko Yamano and her sister, drummer/bassist Atsuko, have been prolific and consistent enough to warrant praise even without the endorsement of more famous fans and mentors. Originality is hardly the point with Shonen Knife; they feel a kinship with British and American punks like Buzzcocks, the Ramones, and Black Flag, and their music sizzles with unabashed, carbon-copy glee. But the band's familiar, three-chords-and-no-frills guitar chug is typically offset by entertaining lyrical subversions pushed through the Japanese cultural filter. They're known for lighthearted and charmingly guileless lyrics about everything from flying jellybeans and tomato juice addictions to ugly bison and spam e-mail; Naoko's odd obsession with food and animals came about because, she confesses, she is ""too shy to write about love."" After founder Michie Nakatani left in 1999, Atsuko moved from drums to bass, though she still lays down beats for the majority of this record. Nakatani's departure led to an initial slump in the quality of Shonen Knife's releases, but Genki Shock! finds them sounding stronger and more energetic than ever. Tracks such as ""Broccoli Man"" are lyrically amusing (""Just boiled the Broccoli Man/ He tastes like pistachio/ Steaming, he seems to get angry"") while displaying a Beatles-influenced rhythmic swagger and psychedelic guitar lines that belie the cuteness Naoko exudes. Elsewhere, the Knife deliver high-powered punk anthems like ""Rock Society"" (which, to be honest, brings the whole Ramones thing a bit too close to the bone), the spiky pop of ""Jeans Blue"", and the more elaborate vocal compositions and guitar solos of standouts ""Magic Glasses"" and ""Forest Walk"". Naoko has often said that her main desire with Shonen Knife is simply to make people feel happy; when you find yourself dancing around the kitchen to songs like ""Giant Kitty"", singing ""Big big big cat/ I like it's fluffy body/ Everybody likes it's funny face"" with goofy joy, you know the Yamano sisters have succeeded with their jewel box of bright, bubblegum sounds.","The Yamano sisters return with a new record of unabashed, carbon-copy glee.

Making Dens,Mystery Jets,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c382ea9e61561daa7f31/1:1/w_160/779361ce.jpg,2006-04-19 06:00:27,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5686-making-dens/,679,"There's something both cheesy and charming about album covers that literally illustrate their titles. Take, for example, Rush's Moving Pictures, which unless you were too stoned to remember, featured uniformed workman-types outside an art gallery moving pictures (hardee-fucking-har). Mystery Jets have chosen a somewhat more intangible phrase for their debut album, Making Dens, but are no less explicit in their cover execution. There they are, relaxing in a den, complete with Persian rugs, pub-quality wallpaper, pianos, old gramophones, model airplanes, candlelight, typewriters, stereo speakers-- however, the trees looming overhead betray the fact that they've set up all their crap in the middle of a forest. It's just the sort of curious scene that seems to justify the British press hitching Mystery Jets onto the lineage of Great British Eccentrics, one that spans Syd Barrett to Julian Cope to, more recently, the Coral and British Sea Power. You can see what they're getting at: You don't find too many bands whose on-stage set-up looks like a kitchenware store, who hail from a chunk of land on the Thames called Eel Pie Island, and who have a singer (Blaine Harrison) who can address the guitarist as ""dad"" (aka 55-years-young Henry Harrison). But eccentricity implies a measure of frivolity and whimsy that is palpably absent from Making Dens; though the restless time changes and laser-show synth overtures betray prog-rock's ostentatious influence, the tightly constructed songs here (all but two of which stay under the five-minute mark) bristle with a passion and purpose that belongs only to the truly committed and composed. ""It always pays to be brave/ From the cradle to grave,"" singer Blaine declares on opener ""You Can't Fool Me, Dennis"", and he knows of what he speaks: Born with spina bifida, Blaine has spent his entire 20-year-life walking with crutches. As such, he possesses the commanding, uncompromising voice of someone for whom nothing came easy; a restless romantic in the mould of Patrick Wolf, Clearlake's Jason Pegg, or the Futureheads' Barry Hyde, you could force him to sing a capella before a crowd of lagered up Millwall fans and he wouldn't flinch. In a rare moment of understatement, he sings, ""Emotion pulls you like a horse-drawn cart""-- an understatement that belies the fact that emotion actually pulls Mystery Jets like an Autobahn-bound Benz with a cinder block dropped on the gas pedal. Practically every track is pitched to hit the back rows, from the student-disco pint-raiser ""The Boy Who Ran Away"" to the apocalyptic ""Zoo Time"" to the climactic Dexy's-charged skiffle gallop of ""Alas Agnes"". But couched within the blustery delivery are pleas for intimacy: ""Diamond in the Dark"" recounts first dances, romances and unhappy endings, while, in the most overt reference to Blaine's medical history, ""Little Bag of Hair"" explores the emotional dependency between a bed-ridden patient and his caregiver. So, in effect, like most prog-informed bands, Mystery Jets do deal in fantasy. But theirs has nothing to do with warlocks, goblins and temples of Syrinx: like the makeshift living room depicted on the album cover, Making Dens dreams of the simple life-- specifically, the privilege of falling in and out of love-- that's so often denied to those who lack the means to fully enjoy it.","Eel Pie Island eccentrics-- including a singer (Blaine Harrison) who can address the guitarist as ""dad"" (aka 55-years-young Henry Harrison)-- create prog-tinged yet compact pop songs.

Home to Oblivion: An Elliott Smith Tribute,Christopher O'Riley,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45769fc7814a47cd86e/1:1/w_160/73d096d5.gif,2006-04-19 06:00:26,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6109-home-to-oblivion-an-elliott-smith-tribute/,World Village,"Moving from Radiohead to Elliott Smith is not an especially logical step. Christopher O'Riley recorded not one but two albums of Radiohead arrangements for solo piano-- True Love Waits in 2003 and Hold Me to This last year-- taking the melodies and moods out of their original headspace with renderings that dramatically departed from the familiar versions. It was interesting to hear a classically trained musician engage with the band's cerebral art rock in this manner, and his approach made for some compelling interpretations, even if a large part of the albums' appeal was the novelty of hearing songs like ""2+2=5"" and ""No Surprises"" in a concert-hall setting. Where Radiohead's music is experimental and open-ended, however, Smith is much more of a pop formalist, with absolute faith in verses, choruses, and bridges. On Home to Oblivion: An Elliott Smith Tribute these ordered elements don't translate very well to O'Riley's aesthetic-- and the lyrics don't translate at all-- revealing the leveling effect his style has on his subjects: These Smith interpretations sound too similar to his Radiohead covers-- nearly identical, in fact-- which seems like a failure of imagination considering how different these artists are. As with his previous albums, O'Riley's impressionistic style doesn't capture melody very naturalistically. With Radiohead this weakness was less pronounced, but Smith's songs are all melody, so O'Riley's interpretations of ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" and ""I Didn't Understand"" sound clunky and askew. The galloping pace of ""Coast to Coast"", while fine in the original, sounds rushed and manic in this setting, and ""Independence Day"" and ""Stupidity Tries"" trip headlong over their melodies. O'Riley starts ""Speed Trials"" with those same tense chords, which translate perfectly to piano and nicely set the tone for the song, but his arrangement sounds busy in its aimlessness, taking a long time to go nowhere in particular. Perhaps a simple, minimalist approach-- one hand playing a straightforward melody-- would have made this version of ""Between the Bars"" sound as elegant as the original instead of choppy and kitschy. Nevertheless, O'Riley's method is commendatory and impressive in its meticulousness: He immerses himself in an artist's work, tracking down the rarest bootlegs and rarities with obsessive zeal. Home to Oblivion even unearths one track, ""No Life"", that wasn't even attributed to Smith when O'Riley found it online. The upside to this approach is that the pianist can give a broad overview of an artist without greatest-hits pandering. For example, he doesn't do popular songs like ""Miss Misery"" or ""Waltz #2 (XO)"", but he does perform lesser-known album tracks like ""Bye"" and ""Satellite"". As with his Radiohead albums, Home to Oblivion is a fan's tribute. The downside, however, is a head-in-the-sand reading of the artist, completely lacking criticality. Perhaps it's due to the circumstances of Smith's death that O'Riley takes such a faithful tack on Home to Oblivion. He's preserving and even reinforcing the common perception of the late singer-songwriter as a classically tortured artist, damned by the same obsessions that seemed to make him exceptional. In his liner notes, O'Riley makes numerous comments about the ""constant temptation of oblivion"" in Smith's songs, even taking that idea as the title of the album (and doesn't that album title seem in poor taste?) This highly romanticized view of Smith did him no favors when he was alive, and it does him even fewer favors now that he's dead. Worse, this approach seems at best limited and at worse patently false, since Smith's demons, while finding expression in his music, were related less to his music than to his own depression and drug addiction. But O'Riley's worst crime is altogether more pedestrian: simply put, Home to Oblivion is boring-- a word I typically try to avoid in reviews but seems apt here. The album's ostentatious tastefulness threatens to make O'Riley the Liberace of the indie set, and its practiced pleasantness makes it best suited for dinner parties and study sessions, where unobtrusiveness is both a necessity and a virtue. The album is background music not only because it can be easily ignored, but primarily because it has no foreground. There's nothing here to catch the ear, which makes O'Riley seem strangely oblivious to the challenges and rewards of Smith's music.","After two albums of Radiohead arrangements for solo piano, this classically trained musician gives the same treatment to the work of the late Elliott Smith.

"Yes, Virginia",The Dresden Dolls,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba19ea9e61561daa713f/1:1/w_160/ec7d9936.jpg,2006-04-19 06:00:25,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2453-yes-virginia/,Roadrunner,"The Dresden Dolls are everything a moody acoustic two-piece typically doesn't want to be: theatrical, affected, and profoundly self-aware. Singer and pianist Amanda Palmer gleefully eviscerates singer-songwriter clichés; even when she plays fragile, she does so with smirking duplicity. If the pleasure of listening to music like this usually lies in examining the singer's fractured personal world, the Dresden Dolls both invite and punish such voyeurism-- Palmer pretends that she doesn't know you're looking, then turns around and gleefully stabs you in the face. It took me a long time to warm up to the Dresden Dolls' rough, dark self-titled debut-- I was initially turned off by its theatricality. Eventually, however, it was the affectations that won me over; at their best, the Dresden Dolls paint a ghoulish smile on dark and downcast sentiments. Rather than simply baring their misery, the Dresden Dolls transform it into pleasurable artifice, making their music at once accessible and profoundly unsettling. On Yes, Virginia, the few rough edges of the duo's debut are mostly smoothed out. Gone are the weird-as-fuck music box interludes and occasionally muddied production, leaving only immaculately recorded drums, piano, and vocals. Some will decry the slickness of Yes, Virginia, but the album's crisp sound often works to the Dolls' advantage. Brian Viglione's drumming is now elevated in the mix, and comes across as more dynamic and impressive than before-- amazingly, Viglione often matches Palmer in dramatic flair. And, thankfully, Palmer's voice is in prime form, making clear that studio sheen doesn't preclude an expressive vocal performance. Musically and thematically, Yes, Virginia covers much of the same territory as its predecessor. ""Sex Changes"" opens the album with a blast of manic energy, oscillating between eerily upbeat piano tinkling and a brooding-yet-catchy chorus. ""Dirty Business"" is a musically explosive character sketch, narrating a girl who ""leaves out condoms on the bedroom dresser/ Just to make you jealous of the men she fucked before you met her."" The drumless ""Me & the Minibar"" is all gasping, forlorn despair, Palmer hissing, ""I was so excited to/ Do such normal things with you/ When you left last night/ With your toothbrush dry."" While these songs are quite different in feel, they demonstrate Palmer's remarkable talent for writing vocal parts that are both melodic and percussive. Unfortunately, the album has a few clunkers: The overlong and dull ""Delilah"", a disappointing centerpiece for an otherwise strong album, and ""Modern Moonlight"" opts for mood over melody, and ultimately falls short on both counts. Yes, Virginia doesn't have the expressive range of the Dresden Dolls' debut-- gone are the warped-vinyl sonic tinkering of ""672"" and the girl group allusions of ""The Jeep Song"". But what is here is frequently engaging even if-- for a band that thrives on discomfort-- the record sometimes gets a bit too comfortable for its own good.","On its second LP, this theatrical two-piece smoothes out some of the rougher edges of its debut but still transforms misery into pleasurable artifice-- making music that's at once accessible and profoundly unsettling.

Estudando o Pagode: Na Opereta Segregamulher e Amor,Tom Zé,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab47ea9e61561daa5d27/1:1/w_160/0b500e0e.gif,2006-04-18 06:01:40,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8951-estudando-o-pagode-na-opereta-segregamulher-e-amor/,Luaka Bop,"Antônio José Santana Martins was born in Brazil's Bahia region in 1936. We know him as Tom Zé, and at age 70 he's still making resolutely avant-garde music, or ""spoken and sung journalism,"" as he calls it. Zé has never had much use for artistic boundaries, and his history of creating challenging and sometimes outright weird records always kept him on the fringe of Brazilian music. It wasn't until David Byrne discovered his records in the late 1980s, ultimately making him the first signing to the Luaka Bop label, that he gained international fame as one of Brazil's most inspired sonic troublemakers. At the time, he had been making a living in his hometown at his nephew's gas station. Nearly 20 years later, Zé occupies a revered space in Brazilian culture and music well out of proportion to any sales or popular notoriety he managed to compile in his heyday. But Zé's latest opus, Estudando o Pagode, is worthy of acclaim purely on its own terms. It's an ambitious, flawed, and ultimately vital work of astounding creativity that's in some ways even more radical than the recordings he made in his thirties. Musically, the album is exactly what the title says it is: A study of pagode music. Pagode first developed as a sort of recreational, improvised music for samba musicians to play at gatherings and has evolved into a dance music of the street-- something of a rural analog to the baile funk that's become well-known in the last few years. Zé claims to have chosen this form largely because, like baile funk (and, for that matter, Tropicalia), it is widely reviled by the Brazilian middle classes. Of course, a guy like Zé was never going to play it totally straight, and the music is shot through with the influence of rock, funk, and hip-hop. The lyrics in pagode frequently objectify women and Zé explicitly confronts this aspect of the style and subverts the music's normal focus. Lyrically, Estudando o Pagode is a complex, layered operetta featuring a cast of characters ranging from supernatural beings to everyday people. The overriding theme is the oppression of women by men throughout history; much of Zé's drama centers around a male character who, when attempting to shed paternalistic ideas, can't help bringing his own traditional associations into play. So the use of pagode music as the basis for the album is both ironic and culturally astute: It keeps the album firmly rooted in popular Brazilian forms, while using a traditionally macho music to denounce the subjugation of women. Does this all sound complicated enough for you? Estudando o Pagode certainly sprawls, but it does so in the same way Rio, São Paulo, and Brasilia sprawl: Alternately in patterns and haphazardly, overflowing with humanity at all points, and messy at the edges. And unless you speak Brazilian Portuguese, all of the album's pretense-- it comes with a full libretto, and press copies also included mock Cliffs Notes-- will be confined to the accompanying booklet. That leaves you with the wild musical mélange cooked up by Zé and producer Jair Oliveira, and it never gets boring or too inaccessible. Male and female vocals, sung and spoken, alone and en masse, share space in the constantly shifting arrangements, where acoustic guitars, hand percussion, and jerry-built instruments like piles of metal and rolled ficus leaves mingle with programmed drums and mangled electronic tones. Vocals are pitch-shifted, donkeys and orgasms are imitated and simulated, respectively, while ""Mulher Navio Negreiro"" includes voices approximating the sound of wind. The record opens with ""Ave Dor Maria"", riding a hip-hop beat topped with heavy descending guitar riffs and all manner of whizzing, fractured electronics, and Zé doesn't betray his age at all with his aggressive vocal delivery. Elsewhere, his singing ability sounds barely the worse for wear, and though he's never been thought of as a ""singer"" so much as a maverick, he deserves credit for making his average pipes do some pretty extraordinary things. Zé received formal musical training in college, and here he seems to use every ounce of it to subvert normality, using unusual chromatic piano runs in ""Quero Pensar"", otherwise one of the catchiest, most harmonically traditional songs on the album. What really makes the album work is that the music transcends the underlying intellectual conceits. For instance, the scene that ""Duas Opiniões"" corresponds to, called ""It's Ridiculous to Cry"", includes a conversation in the Garden of Eden and a revelation of gossip in the court of angels, but on the level of pure listening, it sounds like a damn nice Brazilian ballad. Likewise, ""Elaeu"" couches its gay-rights message in an instantly memorable pop song, warped at the edges by swirling electronics. Bottom line, Estudando o Pagode is an impressive album, musically, conceptually, and lyrically, and the cast of musicians and singers Zé assembled delivers on his singular vision. Whether or not this appeals to you depends on a lot of things, from your appetite for foreign-language music to your appetite for music guided by a Dadaist sensibility. If you're a newcomer to Zé, you'd probably be better off listening to Luaka Bop's 1991 Brazil Classics, Vol. 4: The Best of Tom Zé compilation first (I recommend this mostly because of the difficulty of finding his 1970 self-titled album).

Nothing Positive Only Negative,Facedowninshit,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beceeb335119a49ed0fe/1:1/w_160/f5824949.jpg,2006-04-18 06:00:33,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3365-nothing-positive-only-negative/,Relapse,"The band and album titles here probably approximate whatever people mean when they say ""doom metal"" (which really just refers to the speed, i.e. slow), but the better term's (cause it's the idea one, not just a speedometer reading) ""self hate."" In high school you wrote in your yearbook, quoting Beckett: ""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."" But you were trying to improve. Put that up against Facedowninshit's interpretation-- Nothing Positive, Only Negative-- and tell me what high school was really like for you. Or college, or your twenties, or however you feel when you're thrashed, doomed, pigfucked, or powerviolent. Are you gonna fail better, or fail better, like real bad? When Facedowninshit started in 1999 it was as provocation, uncompromising dudes from North Carolina who hung with the USAISAMONSTER crew and wrecked basements at a blur: seven years hard time have slowed them to a crawl, and landed them on Relapse, even though they're literally one of the last bands on earth a reasonable person could expect to get signed. In other words, don't exactly believe NPON's titular sentiment. Listen to ""Countless"": Even as Jason Crumer swears up and down about ""No chance for freedom/ No chance for hope/ No chance for countless futureless children/ With no hope"", his guitar's a traitor, flashing blues via thrash via metal via slower metal licks, unable to quite get to that dark place where there will, in fact, be no more riffs (a Kelly Polar show, for instance). ""Ten Strip""'s just too fast: lyrics scream, ""I'm a fucking acid casualty,"" which is exactly what their scattershot and well-armed doom feels like; PCP over weed, 15-minute sets over depressive jags that stretch for hours. Left For Dead pulled a similar trick circa a decade ago, menacing and bellowing over their own predicament-- then too it was always somebody else's fault-- but not in a shut-in way either; kids could skate to it, and did. Actually come to think of, Left For Dead's slogan was ""EAT SHIT"", so maybe they weren't just predecessors but prophets, too. Facedowninshit's ""Fucked"" works out why their misery never quite becomes a downer: ""The guitar's my only friend/ Hack the chord and everything disappears/ Hack the chord until everything disappears,"" which sounds that violent, but really's that redemptive. They come pretty close to a guitar solo on this song, so you know dudes mean it. More evidence for life-is-misery but music-is-fun might be the bassist's name: Waylon Riffs. But the case shouldn't be overstated: As they say, on ""NPON"", ""Self hatred/ Self medicate/ Self destruction/ Nothing positive/ Only negative,"" and they mean that, too: Self-hatred gets a lot of people out of bed in the morning.","North Carolina basement band makes its way to Relapse but aren't quite as misanthropic as its album title would lead you to believe.

EmbryoNNCK,No-Neck Blues Band and Embryo,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4165e6ef9596932399d/1:1/w_160/956cec67.gif,2006-04-18 06:00:32,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5819-embryonnck/,Staubgold,"At first glance this improvisational summit meeting between No Neck Blues Band and Embryo seems a curious and unlikely match, but the same could probably be said for any collaboration involving either of these two iconoclastic outfits. NNCK are one of NYC's most shadowy and studiously enigmatic free-sound collectives, while the Munich-based Embryo is a long-running Krautrock group whose music is a stylish blend of jazz, space rock, and pan-ethnic rhythms. Founded by percussionist Christian Burchard after he left Amon Düül II in 1969, Embryo have released more than 20 albums in various incarnations over their 35-year existence. Burchard has remained the only consistent member of Embryo, a fact that might help explain the erratic nature of their extended discography. Early in their career, on such albums as 1973's semi-classic We Keep On, Embryo's music showed the distinct influence of Bitches Brew-style electric fusion, while later records show the group to be progressively informed by Indian, Middle Eastern and North African sources. Much of their work, however, has been too straitlaced and overtly jazzy to peg them as an obvious forerunner to NNCK's primal, shamanic guerilla performances. Yet despite their radical differences in strategy and approach, these two ensembles share more in common than it might initially appear. Both groups diligently shun categorization, drawing upon whatever stray traces of free jazz, psychedelia, ethnic folk, or Martian blues that happen to capture their fancy, while maintaining a decidedly liberal attitude towards possible instrumentation. Moreover, both units are clearly guided by the same dogged devotion to spontaneous invention, and it's this sheer undisguised enthusiasm for joint exploration that enables EmbryoNNCK to so accurately capture the dazzling midpoint between their two softly-colliding galaxies. On the opening volley of ""Weider des erste Mal"" the album immediately satisfies the first requirement of such collaborations-- it sounds like all participants are thoroughly locked-in and enjoying themselves. As many as 13 musicians contribute to these seven tracks, and yet the collective sound is never inordinately fussy or impenetrable. Nor is it ever unduly chaotic, especially by NNCK standards. With so many individual players involved it becomes difficult to pinpoint who exactly is doing what, but most of these heavily-percussive tracks have a steady underpinning of marimba or xylophone that I mentally credit to Burchard. This sultry percussion helps infuse pieces like ""Frank Cologne"" with the same languid, fractured exotica that has coursed through No Neck's work since at least their 2003 album Ever Borneo! At points, as on the live-recorded ""Five Grams of the Widow"", the assembled rhythms can bring out some of NNCK's latent drum-circle tendencies, but the album's continual melodic updates and relatively short track lengths keep the performances from descending too far into repetitive tribal excess. Another of the album's more distinctive voices belongs to NNCK vocalist/ performer Takahashi Michiko, whose spirited pipes supply tracks like ""Wieder das erste Mal"" and the slight-return of ""Das erste Mal"" with a hazy, generative propulsion reminiscent of recent Gang Gang Dance. The collaboration makes its most muscular avant-rock gestures on the bass-centered ""Die Farbe as dem All"", a loose-tongued megalith that would've sounded right at home on NNCK's 2005 Qvaris album. This song is also perhaps the best demonstration of EmbryoNNCK's casual symmetry. As with all the album's best moments, it proves the border between the two groups to be as porous and illusory as any drawn on the atlas, and gathers all their accumulated force seamlessly together into a single, indivisible whole.","Collaboration between the shadowy, studiously enigmatic free-sound collective and the long-running Krautrock group.

"First Thought, Best Thought",Arthur Russell,by: Jess Harvell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f95e6ef95969320540/1:1/w_160/443df303.jpg,2006-04-18 06:00:31,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6910-first-thought-best-thought/,Audika,"The late Arthur Russell's reputation still largely rests on his work as a producer of disco singles in the late 1970s and early 80s. There's nothing wrong with that. Russell rewrote disco in handwriting so fluid and personal that his stature would be assured even if that were all ever he did. But of course it wasn't. I think with time Russell's lyrical work-- one hesitates to use the phrase ""singer-songwriter""-- will only grow in stature, until it stands alongside his disco records in listeners' minds. But before his famed visit to Nicky Siano's Gallery club, and just before he formed his country (not country) band the Flying Hearts, Russell was on a modern composer's track, performing his (for the sake of ease, let's call it) minimalist music at downtown New York venues like the Kitchen. First Thought, Best Thought is the first example of Russell's instrumental work to be reissued by Audika Records, whose Steve Knutson has taken up the challenge of sorting through hundreds of hours of unreleased tapes. Like Audika's other Russell reissues, it features gorgeous sleeve design-- including a heartbreaking portrait of a forlorn-looking Russell, eyes sunken in shadow and cheeks mottled with acne scars-- and liner notes from Russell and the musicians he worked with at the time, in this case Ernie Brooks of the Modern Lovers. Unlike the other reissues, it features music that is both more and less compelling than the Russell listeners have come to know. The first disc contains the two-part ""Instrumentals"", which was planned to be a 48-hour continuous performance but was only ever played live in bits and pieces. The previously unreleased ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is a masterpiece, up there with ""In the Light of the Miracle"" and World of Echo as Russell's greatest achievements. It melts the bustle of urbanity into the ebb and flow of a Midwestern lake. (Russell was obsessed with bodies of water growing up in Iowa, the way only a landlocked boy can be.) Minimalist only in its repetition, which weaves more than it cycles, ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is not what immediately springs to mind when you think of experimental music from the 1970s. It's beautiful, for one thing. And it sounds like it was made by someone who switched the radio on every now and again. In it, you can hear the gentle lope, twanging guitar ostinatos, and sweeping strings of 70s soul, the crosstown yearning of someone like Bobby Womack. You can also hear the ghosts of Ives, Copeland, and all the American composers who located the soul of the country in the fields, the canyons, and the frontier spaces. Russell wanted to gently dissolve the distinctions between high and low, catching hell for bringing the specter of popular music into New York's avant-garde. But he also dissolved geography. The space across 110th Street became as wide as a wheat field. ""Instrumentals Volume 1"" is worth the price of First Thought, Best Thought all on its own. Nothing else on these two discs is quite so beguiling, but the other pieces continue to reveal other sides of Arthur Russell. ""Instrumentals Volume 2"" flows out from ""Volume 1"", slowly stripping away the drums until the instruments melt into each other like the wax of multi-colored candles collecting in a pool. ""Reach One"" is a very early composition from 1973 which plays two Fender Rhodes electric pianos off each other with meandering results. (It's not necessarily an insult to call this juvenilia.) ""Tower of Meaning"", on the other hand, is an orchestral work of great refinement that cycles through slow, deliberate, not unpretty chords. It's the most traditionally classical piece on First Thought, though as always with Russell words like ""traditional"" and ""classical"" are relative terms. The set is rounded out by ""Sketch for the Face of Helen"", a rumbling bit of oily musique concrète that features a bleating tugboat. Audika's reissue program is an act of devoted, some might say obsessive, scholarship and curatorship that deserves every bit of acclaim it's received. Five years ago, the availability of Russell's work was limited to a handful of songs on the first Disco (Not Disco) compilation. With the unearthing of material that never left Russell's apartment and the careful repackaging of records out-of-print for years, it now encompasses a broader view of Russell's genius than even those there at the time could have known. The most amazing thing of all is that a huge iceberg of still-unreleased music lurks under the receding, placid waters of Russell's anonymity. Give Steve Knutson a knighthood or something already.","The first example of the late musician's instrumental work to be unearthed on Audika features some of the most gorgeous, populist sounds from New York's late-70s avant-garde.

Chosen Lords,AFX,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ce13d1975652138499/1:1/w_160/0ee8d9f1.gif,2006-04-18 06:00:30,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/240-chosen-lords/,Rephlex,"Late one night last week I happened by a co-worker listening to I Care Because You Do in his office. Hearing those tracks for the first time in years left me in a minor fit of nostalgia for the Aphex Twin persona circa 1995-- the impish playfulness, the eagerness to repulse, the self-mythologising and half truth-telling that kept him in the public eye, albeit at a comfortable remove. And it felt like ages ago, longer than a decade. Excepting Rubber Johnny, which was years in the making anyway, none of those descriptors have any relation to his current-day incarnation. Since the underrated Drukqs took a critical drubbing way back in 2001, Richard D. James has all but retired his visage from popular culture. In a far cry from his usual prolificacy, he has only the Analord vinyl series to show for his last five years. In a singles review somewhere I wrote that he's handled his elder statesman status in electronic music like a hoary old jazzman, receding deeper into himself and into his music with time. Compared to how inscrutable he is now, the Richard D. James of 1995 looked like Ryan Adams. Which is not to make it sound as if Analord is an insignificant accomplishment. A sequence of 11 different 12"" singles released under the AFX banner on James' Rephlex label starting in January 2005, they gave rise to his much-heralded return to hard IDM and acid techno, in the process selling in the five figure range, an incredible achievement for vinyl-- doubly so in the downloading era. Spawning more than 40 new tracks between them, the singles also helped to disabuse doubters of any notions that James had fallen into creative disrepair. Chosen Lords not only marks the exclamation point on the project, it comprises James' first proper full-length record since Drukqs. While this is basically a sequenced highlights package picked from the Analord bounty, the accompanying press release insists it was the full-length James always intended to release. Even if everything here is already familiar to Analord watchers, it's a welcome return. Boasting 10 tracks and close to an hour of music, this comprises some of the busiest and most idea-packed music from the Analord set. Bookended by the insect electro of ""Fenix Funk 5"" and the sprawling jitterfunk of ""XMD 5a""-- the two tracks that made up Analord 10, the first release in the series (don't ask)-- Chosen Lords consists mainly of wobbly acid techno and dark, low-light IDM. There are a few pleasant diversions: ""Crying in Your Face"" is a solemn 303 ballad hinged around something approaching a vocoder, ""Boxing Day"" is a sparkling old school electro workout, and tantalizing album highlight ""PWSteal.Ldpinch.D"" surprises by introducing, of all things, a banging 4/4. But as with the rest of James' best work as AFX, there's a restless, fidgety quality to everything else here-- bursting with scampering rhythms and analog keyboard spasms, it's a deeply claustrophobic record overall. It's also masterfully arranged; James has refined his tangled, tangential compositional style down to a point. Much like a prog jazz record, it all sounds like a shambolic mess on first blush, but listen deeper and the individual parts start to assert themselves, not just in relation to the songs overall, but to each other. That labyrinthine style, along with James' regular palette of retro analog keys, combine to create a sound that is utterly sui generis and happily out of step with the overwhelming majority of techno in 2006. That he can quietly return with material this strong is pretty impressive indeed.","Richard D.

Socialize,Metal Hearts,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3835e6ef95969323854/1:1/w_160/e561a8d7.jpg,2006-04-17 06:00:37,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5687-socialize/,Suicide Squeeze,"Socialize opens with its title track: a dusty drum-machine lope, skeletal acoustic guitar and bass slowly weaving in and out of each other, no vocals for the first half of the song. When the vocals do come in, Anar Badalov and Flora Wolpert Checknoff, the two teenagers who play just about everything on the album, just mumble in tandem like a gloomy Moldy Peaches, moving glacially toward a melody but stopping abruptly before they get there. It's a trick they pull repeatedly. Badalov and Wolpert Checknoff have this shit down perfectly, but it's all they do. So while Socialize is an impressive work, it's depressive, monolithic mood can be just about unbearable over the course of its 11 songs. This might all just be a long way of saying that Metal Hearts sound pretty much exactly like Arab Strap. Badalov's voice in particular is just Aidan Moffat's smoky mutter without the Glasgow burr, and both bands have the same proclivities toward diffuse, muddy compositions and lyrical explorations of bad-faith Neil LaBute relationship politics. ""You watch me fester in masturbatory quiet/ I swallow a bottle of wine so I can get by it,"" Wolpert Checknoff gurgle on ""Mountain Song"". For a couple of kids who started their band via IM, these two couldn't sound much more sad or tired. All this foggy, understated self-loathing can be a bit much-- especially when the music comes in barely-there wisps of guitar-- but Socialize is lifted by a series of unexpected, intriguing touches. ""Gentleman's Spell"" features a violin that sounds like a film-noir saxophone, and when it combines with the song's murky breakbeat, it's as if the the ghost of Jay Dee come to haunt the world of mopey indie-folk. ""Mountain Song"" takes a bunch of New Order drums sounds but rearranges them to make them sound queasy and disconnected rather than bright and euphoric. And on ""Ocean Song"" florid guitar riffs swim into complicated patterns and form a lush pillow for the empty-shell laments of the lyrics. It'll be a while before Badalov and Wolpert Checknoff manage to turn all this dejection into anything transcendent, but they're both young, and they've got plenty of time. If nobody introduces them to puppies or Pixie Stix or Playstation in the next couple of years, they could reach Cat Power levels of cathartic misery before anyone realizes what happened.","Depressive, monolithic indie rock from this Suicide Squeeze band.

Otherwise, the sensibility-- imposing, grandiose, broadly abstracted, and elusively creepy-- is identical. The Torino-based band Larsen's latest seems a cross between Godspeed's elliptical storytelling and Swans' doomy elegance (Jarboe imbues several tracks with haunting vocal auras), and like its title, it's an enigmatic palindrome-- leavened with ambiguous portent, it would play just as well in reverse, with all of its amorphous eloquence intact. There's a story here, but instead of unfolding, it revolves in diminishing orbits, wending deeper and deeper into the tiny gaps between Antony and the Johnsons collaborator Julia Kent's quivering cellos and Larsen's lapping electrical waves. ""The Snow"" opens the album, a post-rock primer layering deep brown pulsations over mechanical sputter and buzz, swelling strings over percussive stabs of acoustic guitar. A muffled clatter moves across the channels like something tumbling down stairs, a sound that resolves into the crisp tattoo of a marble bouncing and rolling across a wooden floor as the spacious mix presses in claustrophobically. It's as if you're moving deeper into forbidding architecture, toward the dark heart of the thing, the boiler room or basement. Thunder rolls in the distance; the narrative thrust is indistinct but pointedly sinister. The brief ""2nd"" shushes up and down on a ladder of echoing percussion punctuated by hollow reports, rudimentary guitar, and spectral vocal harmonies, evoking some infernal machine of flesh, steel, and bone. That's how it sounded to me, anyway. On songs like these, the interpretive possibilities are limited only by the listener's penchant for the diabolical, and it's not hyperbole to refer to these moments as literally hellish. Elsewhere on SeieS, Larsen leaves less to the imagination, sacrificing thematic depth for melodic breadth, and the resultant impression is heaven to the more nebulous tracks' hell. ""Mother"" flaps languidly like colossal wings, its high whistles and yawning, slowly sawing stings given shape by a gently tumbling bass line, wafting percussion, whispery vocal accents, and a slightly lagging guitar melody. ""Rever"" rises up on a pillar of wowing distortion, idyllic guitars and gleaming celestial tones tracing out a luminous melody across the tumult, with a hymn-like quality to its reverent ascent. All this weighty insinuation, this evoked latitude of experience-- damnation and redemption, hope and despair-- is familiar from a multitude of other post-rock albums, and listeners who've grown weary of the genre's contrivances will find nothing rejuvenating here. But those who still get a spiritual kick from soundtracking their sunset commutes with the appropriate bombast will find SeieS to be a valuable entry in the canon.","Italian post-rock band is like a cross between Godspeed's elliptical storytelling and Swans' doomy elegance.

A Blessing and a Curse,Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M.

Pinpoint-perfect yet still vague about just what that thing actually is, this line crops up regularly in reviews and features-- even four years and three albums later. Still, it's a useful phrase to describe the band's music. Their three-guitar rock is Southern in the sense that it sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd and early .38 Special, but even more fundamentally, their songs are thoroughly and deeply saturated in the sap of the region. The group's three songwriters-- Patterson Hood, Mike Cooley, and Jason Isbell-- trade in lyrics dense with details that are specific and local, never resorting to broad strokes or simple Southern archetypes, and their sympathies toward modern-day outlaws like the still-workers in ""The Buford Stick"" or the small-town drug dealer in ""Putting People on the Moon"" are ambiguous and conflicted, which seems like a condition that all Southerners live with to some degree or other. They write about the South as they see it personally, and about themselves as they've been shaped by living in the South. This is a considerable accomplishment, one very few present-day regional bands manage to achieve: It adds depth to the characters in their songs, and it gives their personal, more openly autobiographical confessions impossibly high stakes. Of course, this balance between the band and its home was bound to wobble a bit eventually, and it's to the group's credit that it didn't happen sooner. Reportedly their first album written in the studio instead of on tour, A Blessing and a Curse is also Drive-By Truckers' first that doesn't present a larger picture of the South at all. There are hints and evocations on songs like ""Aftermath USA"" and ""Little Bonnie"", but no big statements. Few of these songs have the intense sense of place or perspective that distinguishes their previous efforts. If the Drive-By Truckers once sounded like they were speaking for a wide populace that is rarely represented in contemporary rock music, here they sound like they're speaking only for themselves. Yet, while the songwriters are front-and-center, they actually sound less prominent without their regional distinction to amplify their personalities. While this new creative method doesn't prove particularly advantageous for a band that's built its reputation on solid live shows, it does have its share of blessings as well as curses. For one thing, it plays into the band's twin weaknesses for lots of guitars but relatively few riffs and lots of lyrics with relatively few melodies. Songs like the title track and ""Wednesday"", with its awkwardly generalized storytelling, sound practiced instead of spontaneous, calculated to appeal to an imagined audience rather than actually tested by real crowds. On the other hand, this approach frees the band up to broaden their scope. Mike Cooley's ""Space City"" possesses a gentle yet precarious ruminativeness, and on Patterson Hood's ""Goodbye"" a breezy, 1970s rock vibe offsets dark lyrics about dead and departed friends. Jason Isbell riskily attempts a soaring chorus on ""Daylight"", and even though he doesn't have the vocal range, the technical flaws only make his crisis seem all the more insurmountable. Yet, for all the new tricks this in-studio approach allows them, the Truckers still sound like the same old Truckers-- maybe not always as powerful and urgent, but still undeniably themselves. ""Feb. 14"" recalls the impossible romance of ""Something's Gotta Give (Pretty Soon)"", and ""Little Bonnie"" is-- like ""My Sweet Annette""-- a chapter in the Hood family history. A harsh, funny, lusty look at fame and expectations, ""Gravity's Gone"" is prime Mike Cooley, a song that never loses its slippery hook or tones down its ballsy frankness: complaining about the entertainment industry, he observes, ""Cocaine rich comes quick and that's why the small dicks have it all."" Hood's ""Aftermath USA"" starts funny as it describes the messy evidence of a wild night: ""The car was in the carport sideways...heel marks on the roofline, bad music on the stereo"". But as it progresses and the band's chicken-fried groove intensifies-- thanks to Jojo Herman's keyboard work and an always tight rhythm section-- the joke falls away and something sinister emerges: ""Crysal meth in the bathtub, blood spattered in my sink...it's all worse than we think."" A Blessing and a Curse ends with ""A World of Hurt"", in which Hood delivers the verses in a sing-speak so confident and disarming it threatens to throw the whole album into new focus. Songs like this-- starkly stoic yet moving, drawing on influences that no one else in our little indie world is bothering with-- are why the Drive-By Truckers remain one of the best and most exciting bands to rise out of the South in a while. However, for the first time in the group's decade of existence, they've made an album that doesn't entirely live up to their reputation.","Southern rock band offers its first album that doesn't present a larger picture of the region, here straying from the intense sense of place or perspective that distinguishes its previous efforts.

And my neighbor bought one for his neighbor and so on. Expect a copy from your neighbor shortly. Spreading like mumps. And why? Because bluegrass and hip-hop are brethren born from the womb of jazz and blues, sharing the same desire to rise above circumstance through celebration and make a cold world take notice. Makes sense, right? Some white guys finding a connection to black music through white music with a comparable thrust, i.e. getting trashed on gin and juice because what the fuck else are you gonna do...? Well, at least it makes more sense than ""Radio Heads"". This album title is going places: These are people who are ""heads"" because they make beats, but they also purportedly like a group named Radiohead, you see?

Then I would flip my mattress off the bed, lay on the floor, and put the TV on my head so the blue glow of ""ChiPs"" would reflect in my dead eyes. I would lie there and wait for my parents to come in and fall to their knees in agony, and then I would jump up and say, ""I told you not to make me eat hot tuna!"" But they would never come in my room. I think Godspeed! would be perfect.","Hip-hop and jazz-tinged electronic artists pay tribute to Radiohead on an album that features contributions from Matthew Herbert, Rjd2, Mark Ronson, and the Cinematic Orchestra, among others.

The earlier record's ""difficulty"" is debatable; Rehearsing My Choir failed for many (including me), but not because it was too opaque or complicated. Taken as a whole, the lyrics were probably the most accessible the band has written so far. But the lead voice and format, both of which were chosen with a reasonable expectation of the intended effect, were never going to work for everybody. It was a specialty item. Bitter Tea is a very different record: no Olga Sarantos; no overriding narrative; not as much in the way of recurring musical themes. But it's cut from the same cloth, and its ""meaning,"" or the meaning of individual songs, is surely even harder to grasp. This is not by any stretch a turn toward the accessible, though there are a few great pop moments. We'll get to those in a sec. What comes to mind during early listens is how odd this record sounds, and how often the production on Fiery Furnaces' records is overlooked. Some of the distinctiveness is up to Eleanor Friedberger's voice, with her English major's diction and her ability to make the dozen or so notes in her natural range do all kinds of work. Her brother understands her strengths, writing for her crisp lines that draw attention to the grammatical construction. ""To see: could there one for me be?"" from this record's ""Waiting to Know You"", for example. But Bitter Tea as a sonic experience, in terms of the instruments used and the effects used on them, is even more exceptional. For starters, this makes two albums in a row where a tinny upright piano dragged from a the lounge of a depression-era bordello functions as the signature instrument, stitching together the patchwork songs with Matt Friedberger's speedy little trills. Before it seemed to reference a radio play; here it serves as a reminder that we inhabit the world of one band and one band only. Other interesting choices abound: squelchy Moog that references neither the instrument's classic era nor its 90s update; distorted percussion meant to be disorienting instead of forceful; a disco beat that gyrates in place with quotation marks standing in for the mirror ball. Then there's the regular stream of backward vocals, the record's most pressing recurring motif. On tracks like ""In My Little Thatched Hut"", ""The Vietnamese Telephone Ministry"", and ""Nevers"", the words move backward but the melody still fits the chords. The technique may allude to a wrinkle in time or some sort of aphasia, but it also points up how little comprehension of the actual lyrics matters to the enjoyment of Fiery Furnaces' music. I consider myself a curious person but I couldn't care less what's actually being said on the backward bits. Puzzling over meanings and allusions seems a worthwhile project, though, and I've no doubt that on some level the words can bear such scrutiny. Some amount of detective word might transform some of the less musically engaging tracks into something enjoyable. I can't find much in ""I'm In No Mood"", ""The Vietnamese Telephone Ministry"", or ""Whistle Rhapsody"" to draw me back again; to my ears they serve mostly as reminders of Bitter Tea's gassy bloat (72 minutes, though two tracks repeat at the end in different mixes). The album seems to drag in its final third, but really the lesser tracks are spread evenly throughout. It's more a cumulative weariness than any sort of front-loading. Which is unfortunate since Bitter Tea contains some of Fiery Furnaces' best songs. ""Teach Me Sweetheart"" is unfailingly gorgeous, a perfect melding of experimental production ideas that match perfectly the mood and the sweet, undeniable melody. ""Waiting to Know You"" is almost as good with its prom night slow dance chord progression, and bizarre mix; there's no logical reason why this song needs an absurdly fat Moog bass, but hey, turns out it does. ""Police Sweater Blood Vow"" seems like a quirky leftfield pop hit; in another time it might have been this band's ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", And ""Benton Harbor Blues"", particular in its second mix, which omits a meandering two-minute intro, shows how effortlessly Matt Friedberger can come up with a simple, breezy, and likeable pop tune when so inclined. If Fiery Furnaces wanted a shortcut to a larger audience, this track points the way. But such a path probably doesn't interest these two. Fiery Furnaces have other things in mind, and so far the project seems in part to be about finding a way to challenge themselves and stay interested when writing good, catchy songs comes so easy. Fiery Furnaces is the work of thought and calculation rather than instinct. This imparts a chilly remove to the records but I don't think that's a criticism. There's no shortage of direct and heartfelt indie rock that talks about the passion, but nothing else going sounds like the Fiery Furnaces' carefully considered babble. ","Recorded at roughly the same time as last year's Rehearsing My Choir, the latest from the Freidberger siblings is free of conceptual trappings, and is another carefully considered, sonically rich release.

Curses,Rye Coalition,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20db1335d7bf16983da/1:1/w_160/dde27101.jpg,2006-04-17 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6885-curses/,Gern Blandsten,"On Curses, Rye Coalition's once bold co-option of classic rock has fallen into flaccid impersonation. It's the kind of record that makes you reconsider a band's back catalog just to figure out what went wrong. Here, the reportedly stern producer's hand of Dave Grohl forced each band member to take on a less-is-more philosophy and focus on what they contribute to the songs. But since when has this band been about subtlety? Rye Coalition's previous album, On Top, found them cannibalizing classic rock and twisting it with a post-hardcore sensibility, mixing it all together for a faster, cheesier, more out of control amalgamation. Maybe their more indie selves split apart and formed another band, leaving these knuckle-dragging dopplegangers in their place, but the tempos have cooled, the bass has lost its sick Jesus Lizard-like rumble, and the riffs...farewell, we barely knew ye. I wouldn't have thought this was the same band until hearing the hoarse cry of vocalist Ralph Cuseglio. Then I listened to the words. Where I used to forgive their lyrics because of their instrumental potency, now lines like ""Dont give a damn what the neighbor's say/ Gonna love you anyway"" are sung unaccompanied between a few bar-band staccato bursts on ""Pussyfootin'"". ""Oh yeah, all right,"" goes the chorus, and the whole thing seems straight from a pile of discarded Miller Lite commercial demos. And that's nothing compared to ""Tequila Mockingbird"": ""We're everything he's not, we're the kings of the block/ We will never stop/ We're so cool we're hot."" If you can think of song titles like ""Between an I-ROC and a hard place,"" you can create better tongue-in-cheek lyrics than that. ""Burn the Masters"" vaguely describes New York City brownouts over a snaggle-toothed two-chord shuffle, and the one-note piano hammering in the bridge is just one of many weak clichés thrown into these songs with neither irony nor verve. It's not that they've forgotten how to play, because ""IROC"" is crammed with fleet-fingered soloing (the indulgences are probably the most interesting moments) and ""Vietnam Veterinarian"" wedges a sample of chanting cheerleaders in between the chug of the guitars, while Cuseglio screams like he's being squeezed in his bathing suit area. It's the songs they've neglected: They plod forward with generic piston-like rhythms, focusing solely on the one-dimensional vocals and limp songwriting. ""Clutch Pearls"" is unforgivably straightforward third-stage-at-11-a.m. Ribfest hard rock, and songs like ""Secret Heat"" and ""True Love By The Hour"" lack the band's usual manic energy, or any kind of payoff in their melodies. Perhaps Curses is an example of a flawless lampoon, but I didn't start listening to these guys because they were clever. In the past, they made old conventions sound fresh again. If this is what they've been shooting for all along, then they've perfectly filled the footprints of the dinosaur rock acts before them by cranking out boring records after their peak.","Produced by Dave Grohl, this is the third release from a band that's made its name by cannibalizing classic rock and twisting it with a post-hardcore sensibility.

Subtítulo,Josh Rouse,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b413d1975652138922/1:1/w_160/da3f4722.gif,2006-04-16 06:00:43,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6844-subtitulo/,Nettwerk,"For someone whose work emphasizes changing locales, singer/songwriter Josh Rouse has yet to travel beyond where-the-heart-is innocuousness. Here's a guy who claims he was ripped off by John Mayer, after all. Rouse started settling into his current rut with his agreeable yet insubstantial sophomore album, 2000's Home. Subsequent pleasantries like Under Cold Blue Stars, 1972, and last year's Nashville conspired to render debut Dressed Up Like Nebraska a big, brooding alt-country fakeout. Sure enough, Rouse stays the course on Subtítulo, his first album since ditching his former label and moving to Spain. Setting has always been important to Rouse's music, and laidback opener ""Quiet Town"" depicts the troubadour's current Iberian environs atop sunny Harry Nilsson finger-picking, weeping strings, and campfire whistling. Spanish singer Paz Suay lends her lilting accent to duet ""The Man Who..."", though the pedal steel, bossa nova rhythm, and L-train mentions muddle the geography. Not a Travis reference, apparently: turns out the eponymous man just ""doesn't know how to smile"". And hey, if you're too cool for Jack Johnson's stoned beach bumming, there's always Rouse's scratchy impersonation on palm-swaying nostalgia trip ""Summertime"". Rouse focuses on times and places, Subtítulo suggests, because he's not so hot at writing about people. Rouse's idea of a love song: ""I'm so crazy about you/ So crazy and it's true/ I think you're wonderful/ Don't change,"" amid ebbing elevator strings. It's the worst thing I've heard this year that wasn't sung by Richard Ashcroft. Glossy potential single ""It Looks Like Love"" is equally vapid: ""There goes that melancholy feeling again/ It looks like love is gonna find a way."" As if merely mentioning sadness were the same as describing it. He'd need Mariah Carey's Olympian melismata to sell this brand of tacky sentiment, but Rouse is stuck with a strained Ryan Adams whine. At only 33 minutes, Subtítulo doesn't leave Rouse, longtime producer Brad Jones, and their small band much time to recover from such miscues. Rouse's idea of a drinking song: ""Givin' It Up"", a heavy-handed ballad about going on the wagon-- ""This is a world where no one feels sorry for you""-- replete with lovematic Barry White strings. Latin-tinged ""His Majesty Rides"", shaking it like Rob Thomas's ""Smooth"" without the Santana solos, finds Rouse singing, ""Hey, look now/ We move from town to town"". Cool, so does U-Haul.","First album since switching labels and moving to Spain finds the singer/songwriter continuing to wallow in MOR dreck.

Go Commando With,James F!@.$%^ Friedman,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929becfeb335119a49ed101/1:1/w_160/300b039d.gif,2006-04-16 06:00:42,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3366-go-commando-with/,Defend Music,"With indie rock DJs multiplying at epidemiological rates, it's probably time to collectively raise our bars. For a while, it was enough to simply encourage them, so stationary and joy-deficient had indie become in the dark days of the 90s. The first swarm of laptop cross-faders were rough around the edges technically, letting a little bit of beat-matching software know-how suffice for true mixing talent, but that was okay, given that it was such a novel sensation-- at least for those of us born in the late 70s/early 80s on the left side of the Atlantic. But now that most major cities have an indie-dance night for every day of the week, we can afford to apply tighter standards. After all, mixing can be utilized for much more than the novelty segue or the arbitrary mash-up-- it can be used to assemble an emotional pastiche, make a complex genre statement, or manipulate the crowd's emotions as if they're plugged into the PA. Obviously, this has been common practice in clubs for decades at this point, but how well indie bands can be folded into the process remains to be conclusively proven. Fortunately for Washington D.C.'s James F!@#$%^ Friedman, his mixing style doesn't wilt under harsher scrutiny, as the relentless Go Commando proves. Weaving P4k faves Annie, Out Hud, and the Knife into a dark, foreboding 70 minutes of music, the man with the cartoon swears proves indie can be legitimate turntable fodder in the right hands. Using largely pre-remixed material, such as the Rapture/Hush Hush spelling-bee rework of Annie's ""Me Plus One"" or M.A.N.D.Y.'s do-over on the Knife's ""Pass This On"", Friedman conjures a cohesive mood that's pure American Autobahn, like a DFA that's slightly less disco-obsessed. Dark rhythms rule pretty much from wire to wire, which reverses the hierarchy of your usual indie-club set: rather than token electronic songs being used to dance up stiff guitar band material, Friedman's occasional injections of live instrumentation offer an occasional respite from the 4/4. Whatever the case, the off-kilter voices of Tom Vek and Bloc Party's Kele Okereke are made to sound downright diva-like amidst the mix's machinery, whereas strange bedfellow landmarks like Out Hud and zombie soundtrack music integrate with little difficulty. Freeform Five's appropriately-titled ""Eeeeaaooww"" and the creepy 8-bit lope of Who Made Who's ""Space for Rent"" (Rapture/Hush Hush on makeover duty again) stand out among the sub-headliner names, moments where the new-wave yelping puzzle-pieces right into the cyberpunk machinery. Friedman may be a ringer in this competition, having apprenticed in what his press kit refers to as the ""D.C. rave scene"" (hmmm), but his more polished technique should be seen as instructional to the Powerbook rookies of the indie-dance night world. Though Go Commando, in a Gestalt sense, ends up slightly monotone-- and while the tracklisting never quite gets as eclectic as Friedman's MySpace profile would promise-- it's still a salad bar of sounds that can hold the pace at most binge-drinking pre-parties. So put the open-digital-in nights at indie bars on notice, as the professionals may be starting to invade.","Indie dance mix features cuts or remixes by Bloc Party, Annie, Out Hud, the Knife, and M.A.N.D.Y., among others.

"We, the Vehicles",Maritime,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4665e6ef95969323a52/1:1/w_160/da6aed5a.jpg,2006-04-16 06:00:41,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5591-we-the-vehicles/,Flameshovel,"Maritime's Glass Floor was nothing to write home about, and didn't hold out any hope for great things to come either. The prospect of a band comprised of two ex-Promise Ringers (Davey von Bohlen, Dan Didier) and Dismemberment Plan's virtuosic bassist, Eric Axelson, was at least one-third exciting. But not only did Glass Floor fail to capture any of the Plan's rumbling energy, it wasn't even as good as the Promise Ring, misplacing that band's occasional moments of fizzy pop glory in a morass of murky songwriting. Davey's precious lisp was even more pronounced against the drab musical backdrop; the melodies meandered; Axelson puttered away on inconsequential basslines (which was kind of like using a Stradivarius as a doorstop). What a terrific surprise, then, that We, the Vehicles not only exceeds its predecessor, but serves as a corrective to every one of its deficiencies. This is still post-emo indie-pop, and some listeners have no patience with the genre no matter how well-turned. But for what it's worth, We, the Vehicles is post-emo indie-pop at its finest. Davey von Bohlen, no longer lisping and puling, has developed a confident, nuanced and-- gosh, almost adult?-- singing style that makes you want to drop the diminutive and start calling him ""Dave."" Instead of the rickety, blasé acoustic whatever that often masquerades as emotional authenticity in post-emo songwriter stuff (Glass Floor included), we get sharp, spacious guitar melodies with an actual bite. And apparently someone gave Axelson the go-ahead to just get nuts on the bass-- the mechanically precise, aerodynamic lines that helped create Dismemberment Plan's sense of off-kilter glide provide a foundation of seething energy for We, the Vehicles, bending it away from the watery slackerisms of its predecessor and into more fertile D Plan/Death Cab territory. While the album is consistently strong, the first three direly infectious songs are pitch-perfect expressions of the form. ""Calm"" has a sort of Springsteenian faded glamour, with its down-but-not-out lyrics; the starry whorls of guitar and von Bohlen's confident vocals lofting triumphantly on sudden updrafts. The propulsive yet temperate verses of ""Tearing Up the Oxygen"" are book ended by choruses filled with breathy, harmonized ""ahs"" and a simple, ideally placed keyboard blips, an economy of sound producing a rich aural field. And ""People, the Vehicles"" is a dead-ringer for late D Plan, with its fluid bass and prickly/coasting guitars, and includes some of von Bohlen's most striking imagery to date: His ""boys with directionless hair"" and ""languorous girls in undertaker make-up."" That it also includes some dross about ""our painted bodies in the secret morning"" is something I'm glossing over-- the song is so engaging that I'm unwilling to shrug it off so easily. We forgave Interpol for their clunkier efforts, and I'm not going to penalize Maritime just for having cheaper haircuts.","Second album from this Flameshovel band-- which features two ex-Promise Ringers and the former Dismemberment Plan bassist-- is a dramatic improvement on its predecessor.

20 Years of Weird: Flaming Lips 1986-2006,The Flaming Lips,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb9eb335119a49ecf27/1:1/w_160/8dc09f4c.jpg,2006-04-16 06:00:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3088-20-years-of-weird-flaming-lips-1986-2006/,Warner Bros.,"""Hello again everybody, this is Wayne...This CD that you're listening to is a kind of revamped version of a compilation that we gave out at the South by Southwest film premier of Brad Beesley's documentary The Fearless Freaks. That CD was received with such delight that we felt a little embarrassed at having manufactured so few of them. So, like, I said, this is a revised version of that previous CD with a couple of changes made. There is a track from our new record, At War With the Mystics, this song is called ""Free Radicals."" You'll find that on here..."" --""Wayne's Intro"" ...What the fuck? Here I am, hoping to hear a history of the Flaming Lips' much-lauded live performances, and instead I get frontman Wayne Coyne reading me what could be the album's one-sheet (plus an extensive thank-you to the fans) over a homey acoustic instrumental. Coyne's explanatory monologue casts 20 Years of Weird as a casual affair, and it's an extremely appropriate introduction; those looking for a live retrospective that does justice to the Flaming Lips' formidable history had best look elsewhere. So, like he said, 20 Years of Weird is being issued to coincide with the Lips' new full-length At War With the Mystics. The inclusion of the dreadful album track ""Free Radicals"" immediately dates this compilation as-- like the bizarre remaster of Modest Mouse's The Moon and Antarctica right before the release of its follow-up-- a dubious release that can't decide if it wants to be an in-depth live document or a shameless promo trinket. Between ""Wayne's Intro"" and ""Free Radicals"", 20 Years of Weird gets off to a frustrating start. Thankfully, one of the compilation's best moments, studio rarity ""Enthusiasm for Life Defeats Existential Fear"", follows these two questionable inclusions. With a simple, repeating melody and slight variations on a central (and fairly obvious) lyrical theme, the song plays kind of like a more subdued version of ""The Spiderbite Song"" from The Soft Bulletin. True to its title, ""Enthusiasm for Life"" chooses comfort over deep angst; lyrics like ""Last night I had a horrible dream/ But your smile in the morning came and took it all away"" come off as subtly smile-inducing, but expertly avoid syrupy self-seriousness. The rest of 20 Years of Weird consists of decent-quality recordings spanning the band's history, from early psychedelic jams to a document of one of the 1996 ""parking lot experiments,"" in which Coyne conducted pre-recorded tapes playing in a number of car stereos. The recordings are generally so-so in quality-- there's a lot of crowd noise, the drums clip, and the vocal levels are inconsistent. But every once in a while something transcendent does manage to emerge from the cacophony, especially towards the compilation's end. A 12-minute take on ""When You Smile"" segueing into ""Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus With Needles"" is the most interesting inclusion, showcasing a sloppy and frenetic energy that has been largely absent from the band's current three-piece incarnation. The real irony here is that the Flaming Lips have always operated under such a keen awareness of how limited the sound of a rock show can be. From fan-hugging furries to garbage bags full of inflated balloons to in-the-ear headphones simulcasting the show, the Flaming Lips have employed just about every conceivable strategy to enhance the live experience for their fans. Their 4xCD album Zaireeka proved the band more than willing to extend such sonic experiments to their recorded output. Whatever the future holds, the Flaming Lips have a proud history of taking their fans seriously; 20 Years of Weird does an okay job of telling that history, but does little to show it.","Odds and sods live collection issued to coincide with the release of the Oklahoma band's Fearless Freaks film, the record also features a studio rarity and, uh, ""Free Radicals"".

Kratitude,The Seconds,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d9c0084474cd0c0a6b/1:1/w_160/045259dd.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7853-kratitude/,5RC,"Although Brain Chase is better known for providing the muscular, no fills drumbeats that propel the shadowy pop of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and guitarist Zachary Lehrhoff for the stingingly sweet melodies of noise duo Ex-Models, both insist that the Seconds is not simply a side project-- and both would like to devote more energy to it. Equally short on downtime, engineering student Jeannie Kwon joins the New York based group on bass and vocals, providing a deep kick to the astringent, urgent tones of the no wave trio's second full length, Kratitude. Chase's distinctive drumming style is often labeled as primitive, but he has considerable flair for weaving unpredictable rhythms on a simple kit and an intuitive relationship to the electric guitar. Short on fills and strong on the kick and tom, Chase works best with rhythm heavy guitarists, with whom he spars and interlocks with typically brutal, knotty grace. Like Chase's YYYs band mate Nick Zinner, Lehrhoff extends his guitar lines from the gluey pull of the drums while simultaneously communicating with the beat, which is far more effective than focusing on embellishment. The same can be said for the vocals, which the Seconds mine for phonetic, textural, and rhythmic qualities rather than the meaning or metaphor behind the lyric. On ""Dogsicle"", for example, Kwon and Lehrhoff repeat an indecipherable line that blurs together into a swirling, kinetic pattern and, with the force of a fierce whirlpool, is eventually pulled down into a cacophony of barked tantrums, lean beats, and sliced distortion. Largely conceived by Chase, and in keeping with his minimalist style, Kratitude was recorded on a 4-track at his old practice space in Brooklyn. It's less catchy than 2001's ""Y"", yet more immediate and hyperactive. Melody and structure are like an afterthought in this brisk collection of violently impulsive, jutting punk rock songs; instead the Seconds head directly for the jugular of rhythm and repetition. On the album's opening track, ""Moving"", Kwon's dampened harmonic string textures burst into a raw flow of post-hardcore that echoes L.A. noiseniks the Mae Shi or, as the marketing sticker on the jewel case accurately suggests, Throbbing Gristle. Though the Seconds lament the lack of time they can devote to fuelling their glorious racket, the sense of urgency that arises out this situation strongly contributes to the group's sound. It is reactionary and explorative and awkward. Not unconsidered, just direct-- and overflowing with sounds that itch and split, like hundreds of nails bouncing over sheets of broken glass.","KRS release from Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Brain Chase and guitarist Zachary Lehrhoff of noise duo Ex-Models.

Their first full-length, That's Your Fire, hurtled along with no breaks or brakes as the band bled one kind of happiness into another: ""I'm in love! I got the car to start! I'm going to Mars! There's another Snapple in the fridge!"" They had sad songs too, but the poignancy hit and passed. ""Someone pumps my heart until it bursts. This vessel is blown."" Think that sounds sissy? Not against that rhythm section, it doesn't. But after two LPs, the band broke up and then reformed-- this time with keys and percussion man T. J. Lipple replacing vibraphonist Eric Koltnow. This took an adjustment for the band and the fans, but with the gorgeous Here Comes Everyone and now Some Echoes, the transition's complete: The band sounds more confident than ever, and every arrangement is stripped to the bones. After contributing so much of the dreamy grace of Here Comes Everyone, Lipple is a subtle presence here, and Matthew Gengler, a melodic bass guitarist hanging off the same musical tree as Chris Squire, bangs out single-note lines like his fucking life depends on it. Cavallario spends more time behind an electric organ than guitar, and instead of drowning his vocals in the mix, he sticks them right up front where they belong. He'll let an entire ballad hang on his vocals; skip to ""If I Lie Down"", Aloha's own ""Whiter Shade of Pale"", where he sounds bravely fragile above the organ, and only a stray ""will I?"" in the chorus mars the most exquisite song in their catalog. The psychedelic rock of cuts like the opener, ""Brace Your Face"", bring a 1960s Strawberry Alarm Clock/early Yes vibe, and the lyrics are pared down to a few beautiful but head-scratching images per song. As far as I can tell, Cavallario's singing about the pain of staying separated from his lover, as memories and doubt play tricks with his head, until their explosive reunion at the end of the record. That, or he's been abducted by aliens. I'm fine either way, because while Some Echoes starts out as a good album, by the end it reveals itself as the best thing they've ever done: the second half is astonishing, from the hackey sack guitars of the Sea and the Cake-esque ""Weekend"" to ""Mountain"", a shattering final anthem. And none of it would work if they still had the vibes. While Aloha Mk 2 proved itself as a going concern on Here Comes Everyone, Some Echoes explains why they had to drop the freewheeling improv that defined them early on. The vibes splayed across That's Your Fire like wild, loose nerve endings, all but stealing the spotlight from Cavallario's vocals-- which may have been what he wanted, back then. But now his band has a clearer, purer vision, and they express it fiercely.","With stripped-down arrangements and a vaguely psychedelic tint, this is the most confident album to date from the Polyvinyl band.

Vessel States,Wilderness,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa8ea9e61561daa5c14/1:1/w_160/183d04eb.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8790-vessel-states/,Jagjaguwar,"In a world where Lungfish, Fugazi, and PiL didn't exist, Wilderness would sound like nobody else. No deductions for derivativeness, though-- it's not as if those bands invented cascades of spindly guitar and world-weary dread. After being active in Baltimore but nationally latent for some time, Wilderness made a name for themselves last year with their dreamy debut album and tight, minimally dramatic live performances. You really haven't lived until a man in a domino mask has rubbed a microphone on your nipple while menacingly deep waves of stately post-punk crest and crash behind him. Like its predecessor, Vessel States is at once lush and brittle; James Johnson's weirdly hearty geriatric wheeze (kind of sounds like Walter Matthau being asphyxiated) gutters and flares on a pyre of wiry guitars and booming, atmospheric percussion. States is even more reticent than the self-titled debut-- measured and serene, almost lackadaisical in its unhurried progression, its esoteric screeds against the late-capitalist regime mete out their frissons like time-released capsules. As a result, the album is less immediately memorable than Wilderness' prior work, but its glittering suspension of pensive melodies and resounding rhythms is just as fine in the long run. Like most songs on the album, ""The Blood Is on the Wall"" is imposingly stark, moving at a measured and deliberate crawl. Against a weightless wash of cymbals, the guitar picks out a sinuous melody as Johnson strategically unleashes his phlegmatic howl. There's a caesura at the three minute mark, then the drums drop into place and the guitar straightens out into a rigid lockstep. The shift isn't overly pronounced and shouldn't scan as so cathartic, but in the context of Wilderness's economical idiom, it's practically explosive. ""Beautiful Alarms"" is an early standout, with its silvery tracers of guitar and fat, descending bass line; it's an exercise in effervescent stasis until it rides out on a series of tiny decrescendos. And ""Fever Pitch"" recalls the terse, low-lying slither of Polvo, its serpentine melody sidewinding through clouds of understated dissonance. Lyrically, Johnson is a grave as ever, repetitively reeling off solemn almost-non-sequiturs about ""immortal amortality"" and the ""death verses"" that equal ""entertainment."" You generally can't make him out without the lyric sheet anyway. I think I liked ""Beautiful Alarms"" a little better when I thought it was a post-punk poisoned valentine. ""Those beautiful alarms/ Historical coincidence/ As history disappears"" is slightly less endearing than ""Most beautiful eyes"", which is what it sounded like to me. But Wilderness isn't a band that's out to please; they minimize or omit the musical cues that tell the listener how they should feel at any given point in a song.

Chops,Euros Childs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab61ea9e61561daa5d55/1:1/w_160/1622005f.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8974-chops/,Wichita,"Europe is full of old languages, tucked away in corners and mountains, spoken by people who often don't quite have independent nations of their own, but who nonetheless take a national pride in their heritage of words and syntax. Euskara (Basque) in Spain, Romansch in Switzerland, Flemish in Belgium, Friulian in Italy, Breton in France, Yiddish in pockets of Central Europe, and Cornish and Welsh in the UK are among the most popular regional tongues. In a world where just a few languages dominate the global media (and let's face it, English dominates more than any other), speaking one of these languages practically requires bilingualism, and there is legitimate fear that some of them could die in the coming century. As much as I like the idea of easy intercommunication, that thought saddens me, because though we can translate from one language to another, the meaning of certain phrases, puns, and proverbs is unique and untransferable-- check the way we slip into French every time we talk about that unsettling feeling that something has happened before. That's why I like to see Euros Childs including a couple of Welsh songs on an otherwise English album-- it's a reminder that communication is a diverse thing, and honestly, it sounds like he's more at home or at least having more fun singing in Welsh. Welsh is pretty well-represented as far as minority languages are concerned in popular music, as Super Furry Animals have sold Welsh-language albums to international audiences, and the Welsh-language rock scene has produced a couple of genuine icons, particularly Meic Stevens, who only conceded to English on a single record. Childs has plenty of experience switching between Welsh and English as well-- his band Gorky's Zygotic Mynci did it all the time, even in its band name. (""mynci"" being Welsh for ""monkey""). One of my favorites from that band was The Blue Trees EP's ""Sbia Ar Y Saren"". The two substantial Welsh songs on this album (""Cynhaeaf"" is just a snippet) are among the best. ""Downsio Dros Y Mor"" is the finest of them all, moving from its solo acoustic intro into an exuberant harmonized verse supported by basic drumming. The chorus has a catchy, tumbling melody that makes wonderful use of Childs' reedy pipes, adding a dash of Farfisa for extra sunshine. ""Hi Mewn Socsau"" is old-school rock'n'roll, with pounding piano and a little fuzz bass supporting the ooh-aah backing vocal and Childs' lead vocal coming across a little like ELO's Jeff Lynne. Of the English-language tracks, ""Circus Time"" is beautiful British folk with a marvelous, keening fiddle part playing counterpoint to Childs, while ""Costa Rita"" slathers a pastoral backing track with gooey, rich harmonies for a perfect end-of-the-season vibe. While a couple other songs have their moments, none really live up to that level, especially ""Donkey Island"", which pushes its melody into awkward corners to accommodate the completely forgettable lyric. The album's overall flow and structure is decidedly disjointed, with a scattering of tiny, demo-quality tracks adding virtually nothing to the record. The eight-minute ""First Time I Saw You"" could be a nice, slowly simmering folk jam, but it's hampered for minutes at a time by a nagging synth loop that buzzes like a prolonged fart at the very top of the mix. For a first solo record, Chops sounds frustratingly unfocused, coming across more like a vault-clearing exercise than a true statement. Multiple demo snippets and half-songs offer little more than padding to get things fleshed up to 33 minutes (I'd love to hear the faux-country song ""My Country Girl"" fully arranged, for instance), and it all sails by in a flash, leaving just a handful of lasting impressions.","First solo album from the leader of longtime, underrated Welsh band Gorky's Zygotic Mynci.

Dixie / 4AM Friday / Over The James,Avail,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a6c0084474cd0bfc18/1:1/w_160/614a1c6e.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11647-dixie-4am-friday-over-the-james/,Lookout!Lookout!,"You were 16, saw Avail, knew all the words to the CD before you bought the CD-- they were that catchy-- and they got you hooked on murder rates in Richmond, Virginia, and not fighting at shows, back when all you cared about was songs about girls. (Though there, of course, weren't any at Avail shows.) Avail circle-pitted you before you liked circle pits; covered ""Pink Houses"" when you changed the station on it; connected ""Swing Low"", some hick-nothing to you, to the South they were from; had a full-time cheerleader, name of Beau Beau. Hard to know where puppy love ends and the real thing starts: I was a teenaged Avail lover, no flag tattoo (their logo, a stickfigure-with-flag, was second on skin only to Hot Water Music's fancy water and flame decal), but when I cracked these reissues, I hadn't forgotten much. Jade Tree's re-released the three best Avail records, along with as much errata as presumably exists. It seems only fair to ask, why? Given the amount of hate mail I get for the one or two times I've trashed 1994 indie revivals, well, I wouldn't want these people who wish I were dead to think I'm also unfair. Should anybody care about 1990s rec-room hardcore a decade after the fact-- especially when the band is actually still together? Well, yeah: If you care about fun. The re-released Dixie (which here also includes the Live at the Kings Head Inn 10"") features redone liners that include flyers for shows with proto-hardcorers Born Against and Man Is the Bastard and proto-emoers Policy of Three and Hot Water Music; the sound's a similar amalgamation. ""On the Nod"" emotes beyond what anyone in North would've dared (even Gorilla Biscuits!), but Erik Larson drums at twice ballad-speed. The songs are about being afraid of what people think of you (""On the Nod"", ""Model""), their city (""Tuning"", ""Southbound 95""), and friends (""Sidewalk"", ""Beliefs Pile""), with a quick ""Dixieland"" nod appended, to let you know what side of the war their granddaddies fought on. 4AM Friday is everybody's favorite Avail record. It has two certified anthems-- ""Simple Song"" amd ""F.C.A.""-- to which even my parents know the words; songs about now not caring what people think about you (""Order""); introspection (""92""); porch snaps and a capella vocal jams, plus a very straight ""Swing Low"" take ; and the definitive anti-fights-at-shows song, ""Nameless"", which started a fight at every single live Avail show I saw, including the one included here on the now-appended Live at the Bottom of the Hill. ""Are you guys not listening to the song, or what?"" they ask; they also request a circle pit right afterward! On Over The James, songs are slicker, slower, longer-- epic, sorta pretentious-- but also the apotheosis of their sound, more or less: All chorus, all the time. Flyers now of the Boy Sets Fire, Lagwagon variety; Hot Water Music still holding strong. Bass player for this record (guy named Gwomper) was pulled, literally, off the street, homeless from a laundry mat and drifting through Richmond, to semi-stardom/basement touring by singer Tim Barry. Songs about still not caring about what people think of you (""Deepwood"", ""New #2"", ""Nickel Bridge"", ""S.R.O."", all of them), but also more about that supposedly repudiated insecurity, this time more anthemic (""Sanctuary 13,"" ""August,"" Lombardy Street""), and obscure, inscrutable Richmond politics (""Scuffle Town""). The new package features every comp track and single the band released (minus the Attempt To Regress 7"", which sees light again on the new Dixie), and this shark-jumping lyric, from ""Nickel Bridge"": ""Two snakes of poison/ Which one do you call friend?/ Two snakes of poison/ Got bit by both in the end Call these three snapshots: disposable, uncomplicated, a ton of fun when you were there. Throw them on and you're back.","Trio of reissues-- each with additional material-- from the popular mid-90s hardcore band.

The Decline of the Country and Western Civilization (1993-99) / Volume II: The Woodwind Years,Lambchop,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8bc0084474cd0c2af7/1:1/w_160/d2c43f47.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11772-the-decline-of-the-country-and-western-civilization-1993-99-volume-ii-the-woodwind-years/,City Slang,"Lambchop seem like one the most domesticated bands around. Maybe it's because their sound, despite the fullness that comes from so many members, retains its subtlety and subdued complexity with the loose feel of a pick-up band among friends. Or maybe it's because in songs like ""Nashville Parent"" and ""The New Cobweb Summer"", singer/lyricist Kurt Wagner always seems to be wandering his house, thinking deep thoughts about dogs and sponges, and doling wryly homespun wisdom like some brilliantly addled Lewis Grizzard. He finds inspiration in such housebound activities as walking the dog, verbally sparring with the missus, and drinking in the backyard. In a sense, this is the flipside of the typical country concerns of cheatin' spouses and barstool life, playing up not the heartache that haunts most songs, but the mundanity of the day-to-day grind that everyone faces-- as well as the small particulars that make it worthwhile. On the two volumes of The Decline of Country and Western Civilization-- one from German label City Slang and the other from the band's American label Merge-- Lambchop gather a gaggle of rarities and oddities, tracks from label samplers and early attempts at songs that would later find homes on What Another Man Spills, Nixon, or Is a Woman. Technically, most are the A- and B-sides from six years of seven-inch singles, but they have the feel of songs stacked for years in the garage behind two decades of National Geographics or lost behind the bedroom bureau, gathering dust with someone's wallet-size school portrait. There is some overlap between the two tracklists (as well as with the 2001 comp Tools in the Dryer, which spans 1987-2000); nine songs appear on both discs, counting two different versions of ""Your Life as a Sequel"" and ""Alumni Lawn"" and two different excerpts from the out-there collaboration ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"". For the most part, however, despite these redundancies, the two volumes don't cancel each other out, but rather complement each other nicely. Not that there's an official retrospective to compare them to, but these compilations form an engaging alternative Lambchop history, telling more about the band's experimentation and evolution, its range and reach, than any ""best of"" ever could. As such, both Declines sound better even as they play up the band's lucid contradictions. These songs have the feel of a specific Nashville setting, though they sound like nothing else that comes out of that city. Lambchop's music is on country's map, but they take a winding route via 1970s funk and soul, folk, Americana, and late-80s college rock. These compilations run the gamut from rambunctious, lowish-fi numbers like ""Nine"", with its vocalized rhythm guitar lines, and ""Loretta Lung"", to more polished, reedy-- more Lambchoppy-- tracks like ""Playboy, the Shit"" and ""The Gettysburg Address"", which...how the hell has this stayed unreleased for so long? The opposable sore thumbs on both volumes are two excerpts from a longer piece called ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"", which is a collaboration of sorts with Mac McCaughn of Superchunk/Merge Records and Unrest's Mark Robinson. A jumble of mechanized drumbeats, squirrelly trumpet, and nonsense vocals, each section manages to be just grating enough to be funny, then a little bit more grating. The City Slang version of Decline gets the extra one-fifth point because the Merge version doesn't have ""Soaky in the Pooper"", which is more than just a great title even though it doesn't have to be. Originally appearing on 1994's I Hope You're Sitting Down, it's a hazy story-song about a bad trip, progressing from stupor to paranoia to death. The song reveals Wagner at his clever best, mixing offbeat imagery with oddball wordplay. No songwriter can milk as much humor from a simple aabb rhyme scheme. ""Suckers and Smuckers, wake up you little fuckers,"" he sings on ""Smuckers"", and it's easy to imagine a grouchy parent muttering to himself as he stumbles through a kid's messy room. He's a poet of the grump: on ""Moody Fucker"" he savors the saucy vulgarity of the title, rolling out that ""fuck"" syllable defiantly, as if he's just been told to watch his mouth in front of the kids. Such moments accumulate into a genial familiarity: Wagner could be your drinking buddy, or your dad, or yourself in your forties. That homey sensibility plays up the collections' junk-drawer aesthetic, excusing their clutter as a sort of shaggy-dog charm and making their inconsistency not only tolerable, but possibly the entire point of this project.","Two volumes of Lambchop singles and rarities-- one released on Germany's City Slang, the other on Merge.

Skeleton,Figurines,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a181b1335d7bf1698290/1:1/w_160/cb1cb007.jpg,2006-04-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3363-skeleton/,Control Group,"Catchiness is a card seasoned listeners dislike playing or having played on them. To call a record ""catchy"" reveals almost nothing. Without it there would be very little left of Guided by Voices, Nirvana, or Buzzcocks, but nor would there be any Ace of Base, Steve Miller Band, or Huey Lewis & The News. Yet, despite endless failures on the behalf of both critics and fans to quantify this ineffable force, ""catchy"" is unquestionably the word with which to begin on Skeleton, the sophomore album from Denmark's Figurines. Glossing over this young quartet's infectiousness would mean lumping them indiscriminately into the ever-growing phalanx of Modest Mouse/Built to Spill acolytes. Sure, frontman Christian Hjelm uncannily mixes Isaac Brock's nervous vocal tics with Doug Martsch's nasal croon, and yes, they deploy the same octave riffs and slapdash lo-fi production work that served as a staple for any number of indie legends. But Figurines carve their own niche thanks to an arsenal of refreshing, energetic hooks over a straightforward, non-disruptive palette. While debut Shake a Mountain stumbled over gawky guitars and Hjelm's overly twangy vocals, Skeleton delivers gigantic pop hooks in stride, with charm to boot. Misleading opening ballad ""Race You"" encapsulates the band's newfound boldness by copping more from Antony and the Johnsons than from any 90s behemoths. Here, in spurts of tortured falsetto, Hjelm nods to Neil Young circa After the Gold Rush-- though he and his band quickly prove capable of a broader range than stark emoting and classic rock pilgrimages. By the following track, the almost unthinkably hooky ""The Wonder"", Hjelm is shouting one embraceable indie maxim after another, resulting in one of the sharpest indie rock songs of the young year so far. And this, Skeleton's de facto opener, is where things really begin to heat up: Furious strummed riffs send the song charging ahead anthemically, its guitars emitting fret buzz and pick scrapes like sparks off Claus Salling Johansen's sixteenth-note assault. From there, the record cruises through a series of familiar indie rock signifiers and off-kilter rhythms, but as with that inescapable signifier ""catchy,"" elements that on paper read as tame or familiar instead congeal into something strikingly refreshing and engaging. Part of Skeleton's appeal lies in the songwriting's lead-to-gold alchemy; most tracks begin fairly nondescript before unsuspectingly blossoming into glorious pop gems. ""I Remember"" kicks off with a geeky Kinks riff and Hjelm's self-consciously cool drawl before launching into a howling exclamation-- Johansen's guitar soaring alongside Hjelm's ascending hook. Likewise, ""Ambush"" nods to one of Hjelm's few admitted influences with its CCR-fried blues verse, but again, hooks trump hulk as the classic rock-sculpted verse melts into a quirky sensitive guy chorus on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Unfortunately, Hjelm's hooks only burn so bright for so long, and while several of the album's more adventurous tracks earn points for diversity, some never quite register. ""Back in the Day"" highlights the acoustic guitar nicely, though all the Led Zeppelin III maskings can't hide Hjelm's uninspired delivery, and ""Ghost Towns"" slacks off as a midtempo ballad. Despite these tribulations, ""Release Me on the Floor"" borrows from the tradition of Built to Spill's great closers, an introspective yet jam-worthy number on urban loneliness. Figurines take a risk with an album built mostly on hum-worthiness, but these hookniks show why Denmark is wise to dedicate a portion of their GDP on promoting the band overseas. Former single ""Silver Pond"" updates the typically retrofit dead end of jangly power-pop with contemporary signifiers. It's a feat the band manages to pull off again and again, track after track, over the course of Skeleton, and the true heart of the record: making the familiar seem fresh and giddy pop seem like indie manna. Though Figurines won't necessarily be the coolest band you'll hear this year, they may yet become your favorite.

A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,Josephine Foster,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea5ea9e61561daa791f/1:1/w_160/5dcd457f.jpg,2006-04-12 06:00:51,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3325-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing/,Locust,"The operatic voice of Josephine Foster is such a powerful and eccentric instrument that it has often seemed a slightly irregular fit no matter what sub-genre she's tried to pack it into. With her haunted, theatrical delivery, Foster cuts an arresting figure-- whether through the rustic balladry of her duo Born Heller, the snaky acid rock of 2004's All the Leaves Are Gone, or the avant-folk of 2005's Hazel Eyes, I Will Lead You. But with her latest solo work, A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, Foster has found perhaps the most appropriate vehicle yet for her singular and affecting talents-- 19th century German art-songs, wholly reconstructed here via Foster's skeletal arrangements of voice and guitar. Written in a form known as ""Kunstlied"" or simply ""Lieder,"" the songs on A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing were composed by such Romantic Era greats as Johannes Brahms and Franz Schubert, with lyrics based upon the texts of writers like Johann Goethe or Eduard Mörike. Though poetic by design, it was also not uncommon for Lieder lyrics to feature a brief, fable-like narrative, giving many of these songs the appearance of a traditional ballad or folktale. Needless to say, the dramatic range and construction of these pieces nicely dovetails with Foster's idiosyncratic vocal swoops and warbles, and regardless of any language barriers she sounds perfectly at home in this gothic, Old World environment, as well as with the guttural patterns of German speech. The album opens, aptly enough, with a version of Schubert's ""An Die Musik"", a short, rapturous ode to music with lyrics by Franz Schober. All is quiet on this track, with Josephine's multi-tracked vocals harmonizing over acoustic guitar, until suddenly guitarist Brian Goodman (of Foster's psych-rock group the Supposed) rips into a knobby and splintered electric solo that seems transmitted from another century entirely. And though some listeners might find Goodman's forceful presence on this and other tracks to be intrusive, his work provides a crucial streak of impulsive expression that keeps the album from seeming an overly reverent exercise in front-parlor nostalgia. This sense of spontaneous creation is maintained on the following ""Der König in Thule"", which spirals into a glorious eddy of a cappella overdubbed vocals. On ""Die Schewestern"", a Brahms composition that relates a tale of romantic jealousy between two sisters, Foster's vocal is effectively dual-channeled to better approximate the song's twin narrators, while on Schumann's ""Wehmut"" she sounds as distantly lonesome as the lyrics' yearning nightingale. A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing reaches its experimental apex on Foster's epic-length treatment of ""Auf einer Burg"", a Schumann piece whose lyrics portray a rather turgid storyline complete with a decayed castle and weeping bride. Here her voice takes on a dissolute, glassy luster while ghostly shreds of guitar and feedback crumble into the shadows. The creepy, unsettling theater of this performance is further enhanced by an immediate segue into the album-closing ""Näne des Geliebten"", a lovely slice of sunlit folk that breezily recalls the traditional work of Shirley Collins. On these pieces and throughout the album, Foster displays her unique ability to fully inhabit the space of a song- no matter how outlandish or anachronistic its details may seem. In so doing she is able to recast these ageless works in her own solitary image, an image that seems more acutely defined the further backwards she casts her gaze.","Folk eccentric creates an album of 19th century German art-songs, wholly reconstructed here via skeletal arrangements of voice and guitar.

Garden Ruin,Calexico,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d9ea9e61561daa4fe5/1:1/w_160/5f1377ec.jpg,2006-04-12 06:00:49,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1234-garden-ruin/,QuarterstickCity Slang,"After nearly a decade spent playing together as Calexico, and with personal recording histories stretching as far back as 1988, Calexico's two principles are seasoned musicians who by now could just as easily stick to what they know and keep their fans happy and hungry for more. But as evidenced by their recent collaboration with Iron & Wine, and now by Garden Ruin, their fifth proper full-length (not counting collections like Aerocalexico or The Book and the Canal), they're more interested these days in pushing their boundaries and building on strengths. Garden Ruin is the most straightforward ""rock"" record they've made, and the differences between it and their previous releases are immediately discernable. I won't lie. I already miss Calexico's old mariach-indie rock sound and the rampant eclecticism that saw them jumping from jazz to flamenco dub to folk to icy dirges on 2003's Feast of Wire, but fortunately, the sounds that replace those bygone elements are just as satisfying. Garden Ruin is beautifully fleshed out and focused, retaining some of the duo's Southwestern elements but shifting the horn sound from Ciudad Juarez to Los Angeles. Here, Calexico economically blend jazz, country, American folk, and indie rock into concise, well-oiled pop songs, complete with gorgeous vocal layering that's popped up before in a more primitive state on tracks like ""Not Even Stevie Nicks..."" and ""Grip-Tape"", but is now fully formed. The stylistic change is evident from the album's opening notes, where an acoustic guitar figure that once might have fluttered through Spanish passages becomes a minor-key riff instead, sending the song speeding off on a brisk drumbeat as Joey Burns belts out twangy vocals. The meticulously detailed mix reveals interlocking acoustic and electric guitars, piano, glockenspiel, strings, and horns, before finally ending with Burns' layered falsetto wordlessly harmonizing with itself. The high harmonies on the verses of ""Panic Open String"" are absolutely beautiful, the mellifluous melodies and flowing steel guitar contrasting sharply with the much harder start/stop of the chorus. But Burns one-ups himself a few songs later, piling harmonies on ""Lucky Dime"" over Convertino's spryly shuffling drums to create a Technicolor pop nugget. ""Roka (Danza de la Muerte)"" finds that spooky corner Calexico have so often inhabited, with starlit acoustic guitar and arresting Spanish guest vocals. Its lyrics also offer pointed commentary on immigration, a rarity for this album, where the band's usual fixation on the politics of the border is largely supplanted by the politics of the heart: ""So close your eyes/ Slow your breath/ Dream of northern lights/ Around this dance of death."" By contrast, closer ""All Systems Red"" is epic. The song begins as a quiet acoustic tune, but morphs into a lurching monster as dramatic as anything the band has done to this point, guitars straining skyward, even as the chord progression descends and a maelstrom of noise reaches in to pull them down. Burns belts out from the middle of it with a power he's never harnessed before, and when it finally reaches the point of total overload, the rhythms give way to a gradual decay. It's a hell of an ending to a heck of a record, a display of sound and fury at which the duo has rarely even hinted. I'd never wanted Calexico to change, but the new direction suits them well, proving that even in the face of radical metamorphosis, they remain as stunning and distinctive as ever.","Latest from the Arizona band is its most straightforward and rock-rooted to date, as the duo economically blends jazz, country, American folk, and indie into concise, well-oiled pop songs.

Songs and Other Things / Around,Tom Verlaine,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9aeea9e61561daa5a9d/1:1/w_160/299ec373.jpg,2006-04-12 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11862-songs-and-other-things-around/,Thrill Jockey,"Greatness is a curse. Nearly 30 years after they were recorded, Television's Marquee Moon and, to a lesser degree, Adventure still cast an intimidating shadow of influence and timelessness. And while the band was eventually mesmerizingly tight, it was always Tom Verlaine who was at the eye of the storm. He penned virtually every song, and his singular approach to the guitar made sure his extended solos never drew scorn-- even in the midst of the less-is-more milieu of punk and early new wave. So regardless of what musical avenues Verlaine wanted to explore post-Television, his fans-- myself included-- are perpetually and admittedly unfairly dissatisfied. Now, 14 years since his last release, Verlaine has unveiled two new albums: the vocal Songs and Other Things and the instrumental Around. No, they are not Marquee Moon Revisited, but based on the players he's chosen to collaborate with, it seems he's trying to recapture some of his former glory. On Songs, Verlaine is joined by a host of musicians including Patti Smith Group drummer Jay Dee Daugherty and Television bassist Fred Smith, while Around's timekeeping belongs solely to Television drummer Billy Ficca. Somehow, though, the chemistry just isn't there. Songs' best moments occur when Verlaine complicates the pop formula with serious tension. On ""Orbit"", for example, the song oscillates between spritely verses and dark, brooding choruses. Elsewhere, though, Verlaine's songwriting suffers from a legacy of imitators: ""The Earth Is in the Sky"" sounds like it could have been an outtake from Luna's Penthouse (to which Verlaine contributed some searing solos). Around, on the other hand, is a less memorable listen by sheer dint of what it is: an instrumental album. Too many of the songs are flimsy and fragmentary, never shaping into anything substantial and coming across like incidental music. This makes sense, given Verlaine has been scoring silent films from the archives of the Columbus, Ohio-based Douris Corporation since 1999. But without a context to lend an emotional charge, these songs are too sparse and atmospheric to be truly affecting music. Even if neither Songs nor Around match Verlaine's best work, much of his vitality remains in tact. On Songs' ""Nice Actress"", he outdoes Lou Reed for detachment, aloofly spitting lines like: ""Never said you were some fucked up act-uh."" And his guitar playing is still stunning, veering from fluttering, singing lines to noisy squalls that detonate without warning. But, apart from such expressive guitar work, these songs are dim and winking in comparison to Verlaine's bygone triumphs.","Former Television star offers two Thrill Jockey solo albums, one vocal and one instrumental.

Color Strip,Jimmy Edgar,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1613d197565213b479/1:1/w_160/b718c14d.gif,2006-04-11 06:00:58,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2940-color-strip/,Warp,"Listening to the opening ""Pret'a'porter"" from this debut full-length by Detroit kid Jimmy Edgar brings to mind the late 1990s, when Timbaland's nimble electronic production style emerged and a few people commented that he was making tracks far more ""intelligent"" and ""danceable"" than anything coming out of proper IDM. Hip-hop production turned a corner around that time, and all of a sudden ideas incubated in British and European dance music scenes were fair game. With its catchy descending keyboard line pulled from jazz fusion, chop-shop vocals that zip by like a flipbook animation, and drums that keep tumbling over themselves as they move relentlessly forward, ""Pret'a'porter"" jumps back and forth over the past decade to give a different spin on the virtuosic programming once synonymous with Warp. The production is generally contemporary, but you can't be a dude in your early twenties making electronic music in Detroit and not spend time looking back. Edgar seems comfortable with earlier styles, picking and choosing the bits that mesh easily with his more post-rave sound. ""Personal Information"", for example, with its three poppy chords and ridged groove, is pure and effective breakdance electro. Vocals are a regular presence, and Edgar uses flat, robotic processing in a manner suggestive of Juan Atkins circa Cybotron's ""Clear"", where the words are sound first, an outlet for nugget-sized slogans second, and never aspire to be elements of pop song. Some are so silly they distract from the musical pleasure (""I Wanna Be Your STD""-- yuck) but for the most part they stay a layer back from the main action, as designed. The spoken bits in one of the record's best tracks, the Drexciya-influenced ""Jefferson Interception"", reinforce the song's aged feel and sense of an alternative history; the clean efficiency of the electronics seem to portray a bygone vision of the future in which Detroit might have been central. (Jefferson Avenue is a primary thoroughfare in the city, spanning grinding inner-city poverty to the vast wealth of the suburbs.) You can almost see the packed assembly lines endlessly turning out products for which one assumes there would be a market. Techno is ideally suited to such melancholy imagery, something Edgar seems to understand. In spots Edgar gets more abstract, as on the middling drone/drift track ""Telautraux"", but generally he's too enamored with futurist techno's percussive vision to stay there long. By any measure Color Strip is a strong debut. There is no new ground being broken but that's not the point; Edgar comes across as a committed student, absorbing twenty-five years of electronic music and figuring out how to integrate and mold the history into something that sits comfortably in the now. From the evidence here he is well on his way.","Warp debut for this Detroit producer brings to mind the late-90s crossovers between IDM and hip-hop.

Athens, Georgia's Cinemechanica are a product of this sort of puzzling problem. As I listen to the nine tracks on their debut full length, The Martial Arts, reference points flash from all over the place. If Don Caballero is post-rock, then Cinemechanica is as well. Two back-to-back instrumental tracks in the middle of this album are fine examples. ""Take Me to the Hospital"" builds a foundation of brooding bass lines, and then layers guitars over the top that range from fluid leads to walls of chaotic chords. ""Get Outta Here Hitler"" explodes with rapid-fire snare fills and squealing guitars, and later intensifies things with distorted bass and frenetic rhythms. But then again, if Drive Like Jehu is post-punk, and if Q and not U and Faraquet are post-hardcore, then go ahead and attach those labels to Cinemechanica also. On ""I'm Tired of Paul McCartney"" the band recalls those styles by mixing screamed vocals and dense chords with almost-melodic finger-tapped guitar noodling. Cinemechanica make it clear early in the track that they have little interest in the traditional verse-chorus-verse song structure. In ""Ruins of Karnac"", guitars alternate throughout the verses, creating their own complex syncopated rhythm that's accentuated by their being hard panned to opposite speakers. Along with Joel Hatstat's bass, drummer Mike Albanese's frantic beats create a powerful rhythm section that, despite being in constant motion, leaves room for Andy Pruett and Bryant Williamson to interweave their dizzying guitar lines in the foreground. All four shine on ""Brain Tarp"", where Albanese's drumming drives jazzy guitars into something much more chaotic. Hell, if not for the straightforward instrumentation and the brevity of the songs-- the average length is about three minutes-- even prog-rock could be a descriptor. But really, genre labels rarely aptly describe the bands they're attached to, and they certainly do little to explain the spastic, razor-sharp music on The Martial Arts.","Georgia-based band takes cues from a wide variety of indie sounds, ranging from Don Caballero to Drive Like Jehu to Q and Not U.

The Charm,Bubba Sparxxx,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d8c0084474cd0c0a68/1:1/w_160/29ae2ac5.gif,2006-04-11 06:00:56,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7852-the-charm/,Purple Ribbon,"When he released Deliverance in 2002, Bubba Sparxxx made a leap into the great unknown. He was already a curiosity, a white rapper with rural working-class roots, and he'd played his background for laughs on ""Ugly"", his breakthrough single, a couple of years earlier. But on Deliverance, he dug deeper, talking about poverty and marginalization with surprising candor while producer Timbaland spliced his usual futuristic thump with country samples and jug-band harmonicas. It was a bold and unprecedented move, and it predicted the rap-collabo feud that hit country a year later with Nelly and Tim McGraw's ""Over & Over"" and Cowboy Troy. Nobody noticed, of course. Deliverance sold far too few copies, and it remains one of the decade's great unheard albums. Follow-up The Charm is Sparxxx's attempt to jump back into the mainstream after he tried and failed to change the way pop music sounds. The album-- the Georgia emcee's first since moving from Timbaland's Beat Club label to Purple Ribbon, the new imprint run by Big Boi of OutKast-- arrives in the shadow of ""Ms. New Booty"", the witless bass-and-sirens club-jam collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins, who, I swear to God, get dumber every time they open their mouths (""Sippin' on Patron, blong blong blong/ Shorty in a thong, whoa whoa whoa""). ""Ms. New Booty"" is depressingly boring, but it's done its job, giving Bubba his biggest-ever hit. And thankfully, it's an anomaly on The Charm, which is surprisingly great as conciliatory moves go. At less than an hour, The Charm is short and slight for a mainstream rap album, and it has none of the genre-fucking courage of Deliverance. Big Boi doesn't rap on the album, and he only produces one song (the watery, diffuse almost-jazz of ""Ain't Life Grand""), but the influence of Atlanta's Dungeon Family crew, of which Sparxxx and Outkast are included, is all over the album. The production, mostly from members of the DF-affiliated Organized Noize crew, is all happy, propulsive bounce: eerily spare whistles on ""Claremont Lounge"", gorgeous flecks of acoustic guitar and burbling bass on ""As the Rim Spins"", a chopped-up children's choir on the almost absurdly sunny ""Wonderful"". And Bubba has fully internalized the crew's mixed-up cocktail of swagger and introspection; even when he's boasting, he's both self-effacing and defensive. ""If I ain't on ya list, shit, you can't win 'em all/ But until he died, most of y'all ain't fuck with Biggie Smalls,"" he says on the album-opener ""Represent"". Later, on ""That Man"": ""Really don't expect no forgiveness for Deliverance/ Then again, I offer no apologies; I lived the shit."" Conveying this stuff in an unpretentious aw-shucks drawl, he drips with charm but is likeably clumsy enough that it's almost shocking when he busts out an excellent double-time flow on ""The Otherside"". That modesty also comes through on his goofy pickup lines (on ""Wonderful"": ""Sit on my lap and let's talk about the first thing that pop up""). So it's an unpleasant surprise to hear an ugly new streak of misogyny on a couple of songs. He makes up for it on ""Run Away"", a sweet, tender story-song, rapping about two kids who leave home together on a bus over plaintive acoustic guitars and an understated drum track. Bubba wants to become a pop star, and he probably won't succeed, but he hasn't lost his heart.","Despite early signs to the contrary-- a conciliatory move away from the brave, sadly underrated Deliverance and a witless lead single-- the Georgia emcee's first LP for Big Boi's Purple Ribbon imprint is a pleasant surprise.

Stay Afraid,Parts & Labor,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16e9d034d5c69bf2969/1:1/w_160/c202a86a.jpg,2006-04-11 06:00:55,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6533-stay-afraid/,Jagjaguwar,"Right now, in the early age of connectivity, genres that once never had a fighting chance at decent sales and overground notoriety are breaking and proliferating in a big way. Esoteric bands are now little more than a link away, and I can think of no realm of music that's benefited more, from an economic standpoint, than what we loosely refer to as noise. Parts & Labor aren't noise in the same way Wolf Eyes or the Dead C are, but noise isn't merely a bay leaf seasoning their stylistic soup-- it's more like the broth. Their songs float in a bowl of buzz and squelch, with nearly every sound outside of the cymbals and most of the vocals pushed well into the red. Playing the band's second album, Stay Afraid, too loudly on headphones is begging for tinnitus, as the whole treble range is throbbing with cutting, ragged overtones and distortion. It's more aggressive than their previous work, including their split with Tyondai Braxton, and to call it unrelenting would be an understatement. The vocals, split between keyboardist/guitarist Dan Friel and bassist/keyboardist BJ Warshaw, are the kind of everyman deal you get when a band opts against bringing in another member just to sing-- plenty palatable but not distinctive, and anyway they're jostling for space with a wall of squeeling electronics and searing guitars that offer no quarter. Still, the presence of those vocals amongst the music's marauding elements injects a palpable emotional component-- especially on ""Repair"" and ""A Great Divide"", where the vocals, simple as they are, help the songs to transcend the oversaturation and really take flight. On the title track, Friel's voice holds off a tide of shrieking feedback as long as it can, finally succumbing to the monstrous coda, where drummer Christopher Weingarten totally loses his shit, providing as much nasty noise as he does basic rhythm. One aspect of the band's music that's unfortunately largely absent here is the vaguely Celtic angle they've flirted with, wherein the guitar or keys take on a drone/melody motif similar to bagpipes, but they've certainly found plenty of other sounds to fill the space. What Parts & Labor have figured out how to do, in a way no one else really has, is to make noise anthemic. As such, Stay Afraid is accessible though still not for the faint of heart-- if you like your melodies sweet and your lyrics decipherable without the booklet, stay away. But for the growing hordes of noise fans, this record not only delivers but could serve as a gateway to more abrasive sounds.","Throbbing with cutting, ragged overtones and distortion, the Jagjaguwar trio's second album manages to make noise anthemic.

Élan Vital,Pretty Girls Make Graves,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12713d1975652138573/1:1/w_160/a0fa0940.gif,2006-04-11 06:00:54,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6466-elan-vital/,Matador,"Angular, studio-polished emo-math-punk is the stuff of slightly wizened-up ex-mallcore kids, not premeds. Don't tell that to Pretty Girls Make Graves-- they know it. For four years the band has made music in a style that's widely warned against. But what many have read as shallow, angsty discharge actually bespeaks an unusual maturity as Pretty Girls Make Graves throw caution to the wind and do as they please-- an insouciance that has translated well into their music. I guess it's no surprise, then, that the same musicians who OK'd the lines ""Do you remember what the music meant?"" and ""Do you remember when the music meant something?"" on back-to-back albums would eventually grow self-conscious and give into pressure to expand their horizons. For that I'll begrudge Élan Vital's growing pains. The band's first record in three years is also its first with keyboardist Leona Marrs, and the album packages a loosened-up (read: defanged), groove-centric sound, infinitely more urbane but so much more boring, too. Forced change always comes off rushed and awkward and overzealous; no exception here, from half-timed should-be banger ""The Magic Hour"" to post-Decemberists accordion-whacked ""Selling the Wind"". Opener ""The Nocturnal House"" makes a weak but sadly appropriate opening statement. On previous records, this band sounded Xacto knife sharp; not only were their chops speed metal-worthy, the recordings pulled each note taut so the chops actually did chop. Élan Vital is a looser, sloppier affair, soft-angled where The New Romance was acute-as-fuck, humid and thick where the old stuff was icy-clean. ""The Nocturnal House"" abuses drummer Nick DeWitt's talents, overdoing the kicks and generally running him silly on the odd-meter hamster wheel. Singer Andrea Zollo's vocals come in massive, echoing tides, which waterlog the track where it needs precision. Better is ""Parade"", which is franker about its rhythm and takes care not to overflavor the sauce, a smooth velouté of bass, honeyed keyboards, and tastefully double-tracked drums. It's the best rock samba since Deerhoof's ""Spirit Ditties of No Tone"". ""Domino"" sidles up to the edge of the prom dancefloor doing its sultriest neo-disco two-step. It's hard to front on the two-finger piano bass line and vocal-mirroring organ gestures, but peals of overdriven guitars sully the swagger. Such is it with much of Élan Vital. Parts that might otherwise dash or dance or do pole vaults instead feel haggard or encumbered by reverb and other treatments. There's obviously a desire to take a risk here, flee the comfort zone, which is admirable, and expected-- bands always get stir crazy before their listeners do. But the more complicated this album grows, the more I miss erstwhile PGMG's beeline energy, which Phil Ek's crisp production helped to further galvanize. ""Speakers Push the Air"", with its loping synth undercarriage and synced-up guitar bends, was sophisticated enough; ""All Medicated Geniuses"" turned polyrhythmic tailwhips without sacrificing anthem. Élan Vital finds the band turning up rocks for a new voice when all it really needs to do is chase its own tail.","Matador band offers its third album of angular, studio-polished emo-math-punk, here seeming to grow self-conscious and give into pressure to expand its horizons.

Tales of the Forgotten Melodies,Wax Tailor,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aac09d034d5c69bf3ed9/1:1/w_160/95455eb8.jpg,2006-04-10 06:01:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8811-tales-of-the-forgotten-melodies/,DeconLab Oratoire,"Full disclosure: It's easy conjuring musical comparisons when there's a handy ""sounds like"" box on an artist's myspace. Wax Tailor, a French musician, composer, and beat conductor in the mold of Rjd2 or Portishead's Geoff Barrow, has a page on which he lists a handful of golden age hip-hop artists, jazz giants, soul singers, and soundtrack innovators as his influences. That's Tales of Forgotten Melodies' gamut. Genre-melding and cinematic is what he'd like us to say. So we'll bite: His album sounds like a movie. An occasionally disjointed movie with clearer intentions than it originally lets on (think Mulholland Falls, not Mulholland Drive), but still a movie. Wax Tailor samples quite often, from producer standby Galt MacDermot's ""And He Will Not Come Again"" to dialogue from Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s version of The Man Who Knew Too Much and the jumble is easy headphones music. I've accomplished plenty of work listening to it this week. Thing is, it never really finds its footing. Wax appears to be searching for slivers and slices of space, which are chopped into interludes into which he can slide his favorite sounds-- sounds that likely recall important visual moments for him. I love Woody Allen's nebbishy purr as much as the next guy. But it's still a musical crutch on Forgotten Melodies, now being released in the states after success in Europe last year. Many of the songs that fall between these curios are orchestral numbers, some produced live by French cellist Marina Quaisse, and better than average. ""Hypnosis Theme"" features a downtempo lull until Tailor drops an odd rhythm under Quaisse's cello. ""Our Dance"" mystifyingly opens with a sample of Björk's speaking voice, only to disappoint when breathy Charlotte Savary takes over on vocals. ""Walk the Line"", a song about music's impulsive power, swells with violin stabs and lugubrious trumpets. The Others, a North Carolina rap trio, are featured on the track and acquit themselves reasonably well, though they seem intent on dropping ""Wax Tailor"" into every verse, a strange tic. ""How I Feel"" straight-up jacks the vocals from Nina Simone's ever-arresting ""Feelin' Good"" and laces them over the softest, most amateur beat on the album, a sleepy collection of delicate pangs and brass. It's the truest indictment of this album's flaws. Wax Tailor is a beat star in his native France and his earnest (if mediocre, idea-wise) album fits snugly into his country's history of lazily gorgeous pop notables. Though one suspects the scads of American dialogue and EPMD-sampling have him yearning for something a bit closer to the states. Though you may notice there are several Americans among his 831 virtual friends. Thank God, for myspace, right?","French musician, composer, and beat conductor crafts sample-heavy, cinematic sounds in the mold of Rjd2 or Portishead's Geoff Barrow.

Mi and L'au,Mi and L'au,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3815e6ef9596932384f/1:1/w_160/7f15938c.jpg,2006-04-10 06:01:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5685-mi-and-lau/,Young God,"The backstory behind the charming debut album from European duo Mi and L'au almost reads like something out of a Hans Christian Andersen folktale: two restless, kindred spirits meet and fall in love in Paris, then move to a cabin in the remote Finnish forest to write and record their deeply intimate music in utter seclusion. And while for some albums such a quaint and colorful narrative might seem an incidental talking point, in the case of Mi and L'au it becomes an essential descriptive, as it's nearly impossible to imagine this delicate, wintry music being made under any other circumstance. Matching the couple's hushed vocals with acoustic guitars and minimal, deceptively sophisticated arrangements, Mi and L'au create music that bears only tangential relation to traditional folk, seeming instead to be their own enchanted form of stripped-down, hermetic cabaret-pop. Sung entirely in English, their songs do sound considerably less alien and otherworldly than Finnish psych-folk counterparts like Islaja, Lau Nau, or others from the extended Fonal label roster. The album's relative accessibility can perhaps be traced to guest contributions from members of Akron/Family and Antony compatriot Julia Kent which were overdubbed and mixed in Brooklyn. Yet despite these outward flourishes, Mi and L'au carries the distinct air of a work constructed almost entirely in private, seemingly intended for no further audience than the snow-topped fir trees eavesdropping through the windows. Quietly plucked strings, woodwinds, and bells help give the opening processional ""They Marry"" a gently off-kilter carnival sway, with Mi's willowy vocals delivered in an ear-nibbling, Bardot-like whisper. ""Fold your hands around me,"" she repeatedly coos and the music promptly obliges, enveloping her voice in cozy wisps of chimney-smoke. The chiming ""Philosopher"" sounds as though it were composed in accordance with a vintage grandfather clock. Here L'au joins Mi on effortless vocal harmonies before taking the lead himself on the austere ""I've Been Watching You"", a track whose lucid, plain-spoken lyricism fondly recalls Leonard Cohen's Songs From a Room. Given the inherent, rustic simplicity of the duo's equipment and production (as well as Mi's rather limited vocal range) it is perhaps inevitable that over the course of these 14 songs a certain placid uniformity begins to afflict tracks like the uneventful ""New Born Child"" or the calliope-winding-down ""Merry Go Round"". Much richer and more effective are tracks like ""Older"" or ""A Word in Your Belly"", both of which feature exquisite, understated string arrangements similar to those producer Joe Boyd helped score for performers like Nick Drake or Vashti Bunyan. These orchestrations reach an apex on the set-closing ""Study"", which pairs a diffuse symphonic swell with what sounds like a mad scientist's bubbling test tubes, as Mi softly wonders ""What's to come of tomorrow'"" And as their captivating debut proves the great distances Mi and L'au are willing to go for their music, the possible answers to this album's final question appear to be virtually limitless.","European co-ed duo wrote and recorded its debut album while holed up in a cabin in the remote Finnish forest, and the results are suitably delicate and wintry.

Wind-Up Canary,Casey Dienel,by: Stephen M.

Wind-Up Canary features mainly Dienel and her piano, with the occasional accompaniment of crash cymbals, a charmingly rickety drum kit, and a jazz banjo. Her songs show traces of Nellie McKay's subversive formalism, Regina Spektor's bizarro cabaret, and Tori Amos's sweeping scope, but Dienel could be just as easily and fruitfully compared to those outside her camp-- to the Decemberists or Clem Snide or to literary types like George Saunders and Z.Z. Packer, whose short stories share an oddball sensibility and heart-rent humor with Dienel's story songs. Like most writers, Dienel has her pet topics, first and foremost herself. ""Everything"" is a snappy birth-of the-artist tale (""When I was only four I found my lonely ivories and we became fast friends""), and ""Cabin Fever"" recalls her move from her small, seaside Massachusetts hometown to Boston-- a looming milestone in her young life. ""Tundra"" shouts out to JoAnn Fabrics (an indie first?) and erects a complex metaphor involving the Weather Channel and a broken relationship. The 1960s also feature prominently on Wind-Up Canary, although not in terms of the counterculture so much as the Establishment. Stylistically, she slyly alludes to bossa nova and exotica rhythms without overtly incorporating them, and she deconstructs and rebuilds 60s pop mythology to gee-whiz glee. ""Frankie and Annette"" re-imagines the Mouseketeers as small-time outlaws, pitiable in their poverty, and on the opener, ""Doctor Monroe"", Dienel sings about an Everyman who chain-smokes, reads Playboy, drinks highballs. But soon the façade crumbles, and he begins dressing up in his wife Helen's clothes and ""speaking to the sixth dimensions through public urinals."" Dienel marries this hard-luck tale to her most playful verse melody and her most impassioned chorus, half in awe of the man's savoir faire and half disgusted by his lack of self-examination. It's her best song-- her ""Joan Jett of Arc"", her ""Sea Oak"". As ""Doctor Monroe"" shows-- and ""Tundra"", and ""The Coffee Beanery""-- Dienel's at her best when she's at her weirdest, and oddly she's at her weirdest when she's at her catchiest, because nothing sells a peculiar daydream as persuasively as an infectious hook. Flirting with preciousness but never going all the way, Dienel always sounds confident in her quirkiness, blissfully unaware that her melodies aren't always strong enough to warrant such self-assuredness or that her lyrics sometimes sound like clever nonsense. But who needs melodies when you've got real songs, or sensible lyrics when you've got so much personality?","Like Nellie, Tori, and Fiona, this piano-playing singer-songwriter blends cabaret, jazz, folk, and pop.

Death by Sexy,Eagles of Death Metal,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf0ea9e61561daa75c8/1:1/w_160/ef81f4e4.jpg,2006-04-10 06:01:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2904-death-by-sexy/,Downtown,"Since hearing Queens of the Stone Age's ""First It Giveth..."" from Songs for the Deaf, I must confess that I've been secretly pining for them to pour more coy falsetto over their churning riffs. It's a sound that could easily sustain an entire record. While QOTSA's follow-up to Songs was consistent enough, it's becoming more apparent that ringleader Josh Homme is getting some of his best work done away from the weight of expectation, from the Desert Sessions to Eagles of Death Metal, whose first record was much more consistent and satisfying than most had expected. Now, EoDM return with Death by Sexy, further proving that this high-octane novelty has more than just joke appeal, and granting my QOTSA wishes in the process. Singer Jesse ""The Devil"" Hughes (or Boots Electric, or whatever sassy moniker they've slapped on him today) is the perfect manifestation of QOSTA's lighter side, slipping between a manic Mick Jagger caricature and a Cramps-like amphetamine Elvis. For a record that revels in the clichés of rock, his attempts are terribly cute. Where Queens of the Stone Age have always explored the dark and dirty, the excess and the evil, the nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, and ecstasy, the Eagles of Death Metal crank up a cock-rock sound that's free of any danger or seriousness. This isn't subversion, this is good clean fun. One would think innocence and cock-rock would be like fire and holy water, or that a record that just skims through familiar modes couldn't sustain itself for an entire album, but here, all bets are off. The cuddlification is kind of the appeal: Despite lyrics like ""I touch you there because I know the spot,"" they rock ""I Gotta Feeling (Just Nineteen)"" with the absurdity it deserves-- sleazy, but in the same way as a Tijuana Bible comic. There are tracks a bit too campy to hold up for repeat listening, like ""Shasta Beast"" or the bizarre swamp lullaby ""The Ballad of Queen Bee and Baby Duck"", but mostly it's the camp that makes it work; they get away with ""I Gotta Feeling"", as well as the pregnant pauses on ""Don't Speak (I Came to Make a Bang!)"", the faux-Delta blues of ""Bag O' Miracles"", and, in ""I Like to Move in the Night"", being the umpteen-millionth band to quote ""Brown Sugar"". EoDM may nearly cross into Ween territory, but rather than roaming all over the stylistic map, they consistently stick to a rubbery ZZ/Stones pastiche. The other main reason it works: Homme probably doesn't want the puppet master tag, but the drums are perfect. Totally ham-fisted but still incredibly intuitive and propulsive, they're the bedrock of this album's goofy appeal. Death by Sexy rubs out the line between novelty and earnestness, reminding us that music doesn't have to be ironic to have a sense of humor.","Featuring Josh Homme on drums, this ZZ/Stones pastiche is proof that cock rock can seem innocent and ferocious at the same time, and that music doesn't have to be ironic to have a sense of humor.

The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living,The Streets,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a588c0084474cd0c074b/1:1/w_160/3e1af2ff.jpg,2006-04-10 06:00:59,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7534-the-hardest-way-to-make-an-easy-living/,AtlanticVice,"I know, I know. We hate it when our friends become successful. That's Mike Skinner's built-in defense against anyone who doesn't receive this, his third full-length record, with the same unquestioning enthusiasm that greeted 2002's Original Pirate Material and 2004's A Grand Don't Come for Free. With the benefit of hindsight, those records feel markedly more different from each other than they did originally: the former a blunted jubilee of skits, stoned tangents, unrumpled beatmaking, and catalogued moodswings that was elegantly and instructively produced-- practically the chav Parklife; the latter a much darker record with braver production choices, denser verbiage, and a central narrative that only worked because Skinner had the charisma to see it through. It is Skinner's ability to exponentially increase the on-paper value of an ordinary idea by garnishing it with the right details that is his main strength and the core component of what he does. That's why, despite the fact that the The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living is devoted to one of the most tedious and overdone conceits in autobiographical storytelling-- that of fame and its attendent trappings-- most of us went into this third outing with good reason for hope, or at the least, cautious optimism. So yeah, this is his blow-up record, the first music he's made knowing he's a truly bankable commodity, but instead of the celebratory club tracks to which he's entitled, we're tasked to sort through the dark insides of Skinner's post-fame headspace, which is fluctuating almost exclusively between yammering neuroses and smug self-aggrandizement. This is, by some distance, his most interior record. Where the first two found him clambering for closer contact with the people around him, The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living takes place almost entirely in his own head, where's he either engaged in a struggle to stay on the right side of sanity (and possibly sobriety) or to keep his misanthropy contained. In the case of the latter, he is largely unsuccessful-- one of the most unlikable and disappointing things about Skinner Mk 2006 is that he seems to regard nearly everyone in the ouside world as either his prey or his inferior. ""War of the Sexes"" has Skinner-- a man who once agonized over a hair twirl for a whole song-- sermonizing on the fine art of sarging a ""hostile lamb"" before unfunnily concluding with a reminder not to get too drunk, because ""people who get hammered don't get to nail."" In ""Can't Con an Honest John"", he smarmily reprises a classic grift: ""Using this technique/ You're going to take all this man's money/ But you're not going to care/ Cause he's going to fucking deserve it."" And over the farting keys of ""Memento Mori"", perhaps the smuggest and laziest thing he's ever released, Skinner flaunts his ignorance with a flip of the billfold: ""Memento Mori, Memento Mori/ It's Latin and it says we must all die/ But I tried it for a while and it's a load of boring shite/ So I buy buy buy/ Bye bye."" Worse yet, the album's requisite feelgooders-- the sappy paean to fidelity, ""All Goes Out the Window"", and the strangely unmoving blues-gospel tribute to his deceased father, ""Never Went to Church""-- register as lyrically barren and a little strained. In all these moments, he seems both alienated and alienating, miles removed from his former warmth. Even his jokes are uncharacteristically spotty; a few punchlines are so leaden you feel like you're being shouted into a corner by someone who's had about six lines too many. But here's the rub. Not only are there scattered moments of lyrical brilliance on The Hardest Way, but from a producerly standpoint, it's probably Skinner's most accomplished and interesting record yet. Opener ""Pranging Out"" is a highlight in both columns-- over a punchy, full-bodied, and garage-touched beat, Skinner details with brutal candor the downswing of a particularly ugly drug binge: ""Carelessly racking out prang just to handle the fear/ I do a line but then panic and feel a bit prangy/ So I glug Marlon from the bottle to ease off the panic/ Then when it starts wearing off I just feel a bit sad."" On the baroque title track, Skinner outlines the machinations of the business side of stardom to dizzying effect; misunderstood lead single ""When You Wasn't Famous"" marries a spell of Page Six-rumormongering with a mesmerizing marching beat that crumbles and woozes with a virtuoso touch; and the genuinely funny ""Two Nations"" offers up a cockeyed chord progression and a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Brit-baiting Americans: ""Two nations divided by common language/ And about two hundred years of new songs and dances/ But the differences in language are just the bits you got wrong/ Cause we were the ones who invented the language."" The album's frustrating push/pull is neatly articulated with the closing track, ""Fake Streets Hats"", which intersperses a few choice tour anecdotes with actual recording snippets of backstage exchanges. It's a tantalizing idea executed poorly, and Skinner ultimately ends the track (and hence the album) so abruptly you're left wondering if he doesn't have the odd moment where he regards his audience as potential con victims as well. Yes, there's certainly enough greatness here to preserve the listener's goodwill towards him for another album; the bigger and more interesting question is whether Skinner will be able to reciprocate.","Mike Skinner follows two brave, brilliant records with an album chiefly about fame and its attendent trappings. The first two LPs found him clambering for closer contact with the people around him; this record takes place almost entirely in his own head, where he's either engaged in a struggle to stay on the right side of sanity (and possibly sobriety) or to keep his misanthropy contained.

Demon,Envelopes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd15c0084474cd0c2c13/1:1/w_160/979bdf77.jpg,2006-04-09 06:01:08,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2939-demon/,Brille,"Potentially the most difficult hurdle to leap in the steeplechase of record reviewing is the latest craze of RIYL-ism (pronounced rye-ill-iz-um). RIYL (""Recommended If You Like,"" for those of you not versed in the parlance) is the bane of the music writer's existence, the awful fate to which all periodicals seem to be headed. As word counts asymptote toward zero, reviews become little more than lists of soundalike bands, subjects and verbs and adjectives reduced to a series of ""If you love X, then you'll dig Y"" equations. Yet even with the yards of white space awarded me by the Pitchfork Powers, the temptation of RIYL-ism occasionally remains strong. Sure, I can gussy up the mathematics with rococo prose, but the essence of the essay would be the same: Invoking bands to talk about other bands to weigh the value of the primary band. Sometimes the influence of an ancestor is just too strong, and you can't help but weigh the pros and cons of a derivative sound. Sometimes triangulating an artist's sound is easier done with record-store touchstones than paragraphs of description. Or sometimes, a critic just feels like he's reviewed the album already. That's the case with me and Envelopes, the Franco-Swede quintet currently gliding on a thin layer of SXSW buzz. Almost exactly a year ago, I enthusiastically tackled Architecture in Helsinki's In Case We Die, praising it as a landmark of the fickle-pop movement sweeping across the indie-rock league. Demon, the Envelopes' debut, is a near doppelganger of that album, down to its multitude of vocalists, its adorable accents (""It Is the Law"", coming out something like Hopelandic), its short attention span, its 50s-style romanticism, and its infectious giddiness. The second helping of dessert is never as good, however, and much of Demon, despite its resemblance to other cherished albums of recent history, gives me a toothache. All the right elements are in place: Liberal use of blippy synthesizers, songs that travel in unexpected directions, a few choice examples of boy/girl vocal volleying. Yet songs like ""My Fern"" and ""Glue"" have melodies that enchant while in progress, but evaporate when the song ends, a side effect, perhaps, of the band's restless arrangements. Divergences from the AiH sound seem to linger a little longer: The Decemberists/Of Montreal nasal storytelling of ""Isabelle and Leonard"", for instance, or moments like ""Sister in Love"" where the band gets a little Pixies-style abrasive. But too many precious moments weigh the band down, cutesy twee like ""Audrey in the Country"" or ""Massouvement""-- rote indie pop with a budget. After a while, the genre contraction and melody U-turns sum up to zero, leaving Envelopes with a viscous sound that's hard to grip. The failing might not entirely rest with the band itself though, coming along as they do on what might the tail end of indie rock's ADD phase, where anyone keeping up has heard this routine already. Then again, forthcoming releases like Danielson's Ships and the Fiery Furnaces' Bitter Tea don't show signs of fickle-pop fatigue, an argument for the prosecution. The truth may be that Envelopes are simply C+ purveyors of the sound, good for passing a half-hour, but in the end, worthy of nothing deeper than RIYL-ism.","Much-hyped indie pop band carries echoes of Architecture in Helsinki and Of Montreal.

They Think They Are the Robocop Kraus,The Robocop Kraus,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32813d1975652138a17/1:1/w_160/be7a15d9.gif,2006-04-09 06:01:07,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6955-they-think-they-are-the-robocop-kraus/,Epitaph,"If 2002 was our current post-punk revival's 1979-- with the Rapture, Liars, Interpol, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs emerging with fresh takes on not-so-unknown pleasures-- then right now we should be in 1983, the time when punk's confrontational anti-fashion gave way to Flock of Seagulls salon specials, Talking Heads graduated from CBGB to MTV, the masses chose the Fixx over the Fall, and the difference between late-period Gang of Four and early INXS was becoming increasingly negligible. So in this sense, Nuremburg quintet the Robocop Kraus' U.S. debut (and fourth album overall) couldn't be better timed. Their version of post-punk lops off the ""st-punk"" part and just adds a ""p"" to the end, adhering to the genre's premium on mechanistic rhythmic precision-- and what do Germans know better than precision-- but with the sharp angles and jagged edges gilded into smooth, shiny (and sometimes indistinguishable) surfaces. That could also be said of every aspiring skinny-tie merchant from the Killers to We Are Scientists, but the Robocop Kraus are a more sublime, less marketable prospect, and not just because they name-drop Drive Like Jehu, base songs around the rinky-dink Casiotones from Trio's ""Da Da Da"", and have a bass player who looks like D. Boon. They Think They Are the Robocop Kraus dwells on mundane matters that would put most faux-hawked fashionistas to sleep: proletariat politics, morning commutes, and urban planning. But the Robocop Kraus are not here to smash the system, but rather question it, over fine wine and congenial conversation. The most immediately engaging track here pays tribute to German Mattias Rust's 1987 Cessna flight into Moscow's Red Square, but it sums up the band's ethos in the simplest, most polite terms: It's called ""You Don't Have to Shout"", and as the song ably demonstrates, it's much more gratifying to clap your hands than raise your voice. The Robocop Kraus' mild-mannered temperament would be a greater liability were it not for the consistently spirited performances of frontman Thomas Lang: On ""You Don't Have to Shout"", he's an Alex Kapranos who doesn't have to check himself in the mirror every 20 seconds, while on opener ""After Laughter Comes Tears"", he mainlines the inquisitive intensity that David Byrne brought to ""Life During Wartime"". And when the songs do push Lang outside of his comfort zone-- like on the overwrought balladic turn ""Life Amazes Us Despite Our Miserable Future"", or the brazen Brit affectations on ""There Are Better Lights in Hollywood""-- his mates are there to back him up with game-saving group choruses better suited to the union hall than the discotheque. If nothing else, the Robocop Kraus should go down as one of the few post-millennial post-punk bands to remind us that white belts and blue collars do not clash.","Epitaph offers the first U.S. release from the veteran German New Pop revivalists.

Syntoptikon,Major Stars,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35dc0084474cd0c345a/1:1/w_160/43eb5ef1.jpg,2006-04-09 06:01:06,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5654-syntoptikon/,Important,"Last month, Major Stars left their headquarters, psych-shop/comfortable basement Twisted Village, and trekked the 30 vertical feet to my own old headquarters, psych-jukebox/punk-bar/comfortable second floor Charlie's Kitchen, to play a record release show for their fifth proper full-length, Syntoptikon. The neighborhooded non-heroics were typical: Major Stars should play the band next door, even if their publicist sort of apologized in an e-mail to me for them sounding like a ""generic bar band."" He likes the record, too; I think he figured I'd need glamour to get with it, though I didn't. But I can empathize: One time (in these pages, matter of fact), I also tried to sell Major Stars on a bigger ticket-- ""rock reclamation"" or something like that-- and had to wait six months (and see 'em in two different bars) before realizing they were a bar band, and thank God for it. Like lots of bar bands, Major Stars know an awful lot of music (Wayne Rogers and Kate Village run one of the most insanely specialized music shops in the country), and they also enjoy a good fiery solo (try ""Syntoptikon""). Their band has just enough members to be awkward on any stage (three guitarists, a bassist, designated vocalist, flailing drummer), and when they play, they seem to out-drink half of the audience. They also have bar-band stagemoves down: Rogers thrusts his hips when he lights up his guitar; Village does a good guitar-as-dick; and Sandra Barrett kinda runway-walks across the stage when she sings. Unlike a lot of bar bands, Major Stars are also a full-on psych group, albeit not dull or abstruse. They have groove, thanks to Dave Dougan's bass and Casey Keenan's ability to keep time across five-minute string-improvs, and almost every vocal part is melodic beyond the standard psych wail/drug mumble. After the release of last summer's ""Black Road"" b/w ""Pocket"" single-- my favorite of 2005-- I wrote that Major Stars' songs ""worship the guitar without worshipping the inflated package it sometimes hides,"" a critique that turned out to be more about my hang-ups than theirs. Those two songs are included here and they are nothing but monolithic package-swinging (though half the time, at least, the package is female-appended): Syntoptikon dreams big. Who cares about access to a band playing rock music (even I've been in a band!)? It's no fun unless they still want to change somebody by doing it, or get laid by doing it-- two things that are surely the same. ""Collapsing"" makes indelible a mere 1:25 of Barrett, with two slashing chords and set-forth-the-army snares; she's all octaves and nostalgia, then stands back as Rogers & co. chorus in circles around her wayback dream. ""Fake Date"" comes on more non-committal (as did ""Pocket"" and ""Black Road"", and as ""Cinnamon and Lightning"" is here, though it's catchy as fuck), but then the rhythm drops out and the nonchalance is just a front: There's even an avenging riff to make you forget the lapse. This is also, presumably, why they've got ""The Ravager"" and ""Syntoptikon"" around, to bury the bleeding soft parts. It doesn't work-- Syntoptikon will be a record that leaves a mark, it's too raw to do otherwise-- but that's rock for you: The guitar always has something behind it, and sometimes above it, too.","Important Records release features both sides of 2005's excellent ""Black Road""/""Pocket"" single, plus other top offerings from this psych-tinged bar band.

Every Day Is Exactly the Same EP,Nine Inch Nails,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c406c0084474cd0c35d9/1:1/w_160/f111ce6d.jpg,2006-04-09 06:01:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5805-every-day-is-exactly-the-same-ep/,InterscopeNothing,"If Interscope execs chose to sticker new pressings of the platinum-selling With Teeth with a claim that the album spawned three #1 singles, they wouldn't be lying. Of course, Trent turned that trifecta on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, where hits are gauged by radio play-- not sales to the record-buying public. Perhaps surprisingly, then, Every Day Is Exactly the Same is the first stateside EP lifted from With Teeth. To compensate, the folks at Interscope and Nothing did the right thing and compiled remixes previously available only on import releases and 12"" singles. If you've already been buying on import, only the ""Every Day"" remix is new to this EP, and it's the track that most disappoints. The first radio release from With Teeth, ""The Hand That Feeds"", is given two treatments. The DFA do what they do best, starting with some Pac-Man burbles before their requisite 4/4 disco pulse infiltrates the song's angst-ridden heart, replacing the pro-forma NIN ruckus and plumping the track up to nine minutes. They also slow down Reznor's vocals just enough to put them in step with this new, slinkier beat. It's disorienting at first if you're familiar with the original, and it accentuates the lesser qualities of Reznor's lyrical bent, but the treatment works beautifully. By contrast, Photek's ""Straight Mix"" of ""Hand"" is as advertised. He does nothing more to the tune than pad it with starch-- some drum machine, some coming-up synths, and an extended strobe-light outro. Despite the additions, the song emerges relatively unchanged. There are also two additional versions of the album's second single, ""Only"", with remixers El-P and Richard X approaching the track very differently. El-P's version is claustrophobic; he takes Reznor's speak/sung narrative and uses the downtrodden backing to accentuate the paranoia inherent within the babbling. Lonely horn blasts and what sounds like a warbling robot turkey splatter the turgid soundscape, turning a seemingly flighty, self-castigating jaunt into a harrowing (and somewhat cloying) experience. Richard X turns that psychosis upside-down. Ignoring any possible subtext within the lyric, Richard treats the song the way he does tracks by Annie and the Sugababes-- speed the tempo up, add some glitter and percussion, and get people dancing. Both these remixes work, but Trent's cathartic hair-pulling sounds much more comfortable in Richard X's hands. The new remix is cold and ordinary, with Interpol rhythm section Sam Fogarino and Carlos D. doing for ""Every Day"" what U2's Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. did for the ""Mission Impossible"" theme a few years back: they ""remix"" it. Out are most of the vocals, excepting some shouts, some cooing, and the chorus. You know, in case you forget what song you're listening to. Lots of traditional remix flourishes flaunt over the course of the track's five-minute length, none doing much of anything to enhance or treat the song-- and then it's over. It's a disappointing way for a record to end. Just click back a few tracks and forget it ever happened.","With Teeth single is buffered by remixes from the DFA, Richard X, El-P, Photek, and members of Interpol.

You in Reverse,Built to Spill,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ee13d1975652138bca/1:1/w_160/8be705c0.jpg,2006-04-09 06:01:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1016-you-in-reverse/,Warner Bros.,"It had seemed as if the story of Built to Spill was already more or less written: Indie pop band forgoes simple, summery perfection of early work to craft epic, melodic guitar-rock. From 1996's Perfect From Now On through 2001's Ancient Melodies of the Future, Built to Spill records served as a reliable platform for Doug Martsch's plaintive and layered songwriting, brought to life by a band whose talent and proficiency at times seemed boundless. You in Reverse marks the first steps of an unexpected third chapter in the group's saga, casting off the usual meticulous guitar overdubs and studio polish in favor of a less refined, more spontaneous approach. While the results are spotty, the change itself is welcome. Ancient Melodies of the Future was short on inspiration but flawlessly executed; tracks like ""You Are"" showed that the band could still make good on a paucity of musical ideas. By contrast, they sound downright energized on You in Reverse. The first Built to Spill album in a decade not to feature Phil Ek's crystalline production, You in Reverse wastes no time in establishing itself as its own distinct entity within the band's catalog: As the album begins, drummer Scott Plouf lays down an urgent backbeat that immediately blasts away the band's recent complacency, establishing opener ""Goin' Against Your Mind"" as one of their most insistent and muscular songs. That same spirit is evident on ""Conventional Wisdom"", which evokes the best of 1999's Keep It Like a Secret by pairing an explosive guitar hook with a characteristically strong Martsch vocal melody. While Ek might have pushed ""Conventional Wisdom"" toward restrained transcendence, here it conveys an unchecked exuberance that hasn't graced a Built to Spill record since There's Nothing Wrong With Love. Or at least, it does so for about two minutes, at which point Martsch stops singing and a totally unnecessary four-minute guitar jam ensues. Long songs are by no means new for Built to Spill but You in Reverse suffers from a lack of structure that leaves much of it sounding indulgent and extraneous. The longer songs on the classic Perfect From Now On invariably included a few grand but unobtrusive structural changes, as well as subtle shifts in dymanics and feel-- ""Velvet Waltz"", with its layers of shimmering guitar and reverberating percussion, seems downright economical at eight minutes. Most of the songs on You in Reverse start at full-blast, and the band often seems to have trouble figuring out where to go from there-- when the chorus rolls around at minute five of ""Wherever You Go"", not much has changed since the chorus three minutes prior. Aside from its abundance of overlong songs, You in Reverse is marred by a lack of strong melody when compared to Built to Spill's other records; aside from ""Conventional Wisdom"", nothing on You in Reverse approaches the seamless melodic dexterity of the band's best work. And yet this is also their most promising statement in years; far from the lovely stagnation of Ancient Melodies, You in Reverse suffers from the awkwardness of new beginnings.","Latest from Doug Martsch and co. marks the first steps of an unexpected third chapter in the group's saga, casting off the usual meticulous guitar overdubs and studio polish in favor of a less refined, more spontaneous approach.

Ardent Fevers,Tanakh,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a728ea9e61561daa5511/1:1/w_160/875acf33.jpg,2006-04-06 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7929-ardent-fevers/,Alien8,"Ardent Fevers is the fourth album from the stubbornly indefinable collective Tanakh, and it was recorded after the group's leader Jesse Poe relocated from Virginia to Florence, Italy. This was a move that seems entirely in keeping with the outfit's history-- Tanakh has always exhibited a reluctance to stay affixed in one place. Over the course of their three prior albums, Tanakh's music has drifted serenely across foggy intersections of pan-ethnic folk, improvised drones, and psychedelic pop. Now, perhaps guided in part by homesickness, the group has built upon 2004's Dieu Deuil to craft their most purely song-oriented collection to date (and arguably the most accessible Alien8 release ever) by subtly guiding their sound towards the organic, refracted Americana of acts like Calexico or Pinetop Seven. In its past incarnations, Tanakh often seemed to be simply comprised of Poe and whatever collaborators happened to be handy, but on Ardent Fevers the musicians have taken on the unmistakable appearance of an actual band. Recorded by Brian Hoffa, who has worked with groups ranging from Labradford to Camper Van Beethoven, and featuring contributions from Isobel Campbell and Alex Neilson, the album is veritably bursting with amplified color and detail. The songs were co-written by Poe and guitarist Umberto Trivella, a partnership that grants the material an enhanced, groove-centered propulsion that is further punctuated by the frequent addition of Muscle Shoals-style horns, dustbowl lap steel, and surprising abundance of hypercharged, Crazy Horse guitar soloing. With its thoughtful construction and heavy emphasis on Poe's dusky vocals, Ardent Fevers might seem unrecognizable to listeners only familiar with the grainy, abstract textures of 2004's self-titled double album. The differences should be apparent right from the opening notes of ""Drink to Sher"", which masterfully combines front-porch guitars and jazzy horns, or on the soulful, brassy ""Deeper"", which rides an elegant swell of Blonde on Blonde organ. In the past, Tanakh's use of violin and strings could often lend the music a certain Eastern European gypsy flourish, but here, on such tracks as ""Like I Used To"", they also help provide a distinctly C&W; atmosphere, issuing a quiet floorboard creak beneath Poe's dusty boots. Elsewhere, on tracks like the delicate ""Restless Hands"" or the brooding ""Winter Song"", Tanakh return to the more familiar waters of Fairport-style UK folk-rock, directed by Poe's sweet melodies and unerring sense for the understated narrative. And so it also appears on the rainswept, Leonard Cohen climes of ""Still Trying To Find You Home"", before Poe and Trivella unveil a blistering, wholly unforeseen dual guitar jam. This process is later repeated on the set-closing ""Take and Read"", and though these are the exact sort of solos that Neil Young should just have gone ahead and patented 25 years ago, there's no denying that their sudden appearance provides the album with a crucial, throat-scorching jolt of undiluted cactus juice. As with Tanakh's previous releases, there is a sense of loss or dislocation that hovers mirage-like around the edges here, as though the whole mysterious enterprise might vanish in a cloud of smoke if addressed too directly. Intoxicating though it is, Ardent Fevers leaves the listener with little concise idea about what exactly constitutes Tanakh's true sound or which direction they might travel next, but this vague disorientation shouldn't be enough to discourage repeat investigations into the matter.","The stubbornly indefinable collective crafts its most purely song-oriented collection to date, guiding its sound toward the organic, refracted Americana of acts like Calexico or Pinetop Seven.

The DFA Remixes: Chapter One,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8135e6ef9596932111a/1:1/w_160/c46905a8.gif,2006-04-06 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2034-the-dfa-remixes-chapter-one/,AstralwerksDFA,"Electro-house remixer Ewan Pearson likes to talk about reviving the 1980s ""extended mix,"" using dance music's arsenal of sonic tricks to inflate songs from the inside, ballooning them into decadent anthems whose radical but respectful relationship to the original can evade the tricky song-versus-track binary, and instead play around with both notions. The ""song"" remains as a corporeal latticework, holding everything together with personable charisma, while the ""track"" elements (riffs, beats, noisy eruptions) are marshalled into elaborately staged configurations, sometimes mimicking verse-chorus structures, and sometimes lavishly unveiled in epic movements that would make Pink Floyd proud. Pearson's notion is typical of a generalized will-to-overproduction that motivates many of the best artists in contemporary dance music, from Dominik Eulberg to Jacques Lu Cont, to offer their most interesting work as remixes for other artists. The DFA would probably sympathise as well: At their expansive best, the DFA's remixes can resemble gleaming, lavishly detailed architectural structures. It is here, rather than on artist projects such as LCD Soundsystem, that you can hear most clearly James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy's understanding of disco as a space of infinite possibility, the 4/4 beat providing a continuum around which all manner of grandiose visions can be assembled and demolished. The word ""disco"" must be emphasised: Whatever else Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy might throw on top, it's that endless throb that forms the core of the the duo's work. Owing to their label's benefaction of rock and noise acts, it's tempting to claim that the DFA have summoned up some sort of utopian, pan-genre ""One Nation Under a Groove"" vibe in which passing resemblances to Tago Mago or Remain in Light signal rock's discovery of a way to make dance music that's not, y'know Dance Music. But the DFA's rock credentials are just that, granting them a context and an audience that allows their engagement with dance's mind-altering flights of fancy to appear more exciting and unprecedented than they otherwise might. An illusion, then, but a viscerally effective one. It helps the duo's rock cred that their drums usually sound like they've been recorded live in a chicken coop using a Dictaphone, but listen to the assembled remixes on this compilation in chronological order, and it becomes clear that the DFA have all along been engaged in a flight from rock. Sure, their version of Radio 4's ""Dance to the Underground"" might be the archetypal ""disco-punk"" track, smothering the sharp, jolting restlessness of the original with deep disco bass, eerie keyboards, and dub echo. But it's the act of smothering itself that is important, not the sharpness of what is smothered: Early remix efforts for Le Tigre, Fischerspooner, and Metro Area all come out blearier and hazier (not to mention better) than the originals, their wonky live feel evocative not of punk energy but the thrilling anxiety that at any moment the groove might fall apart, as if the possibility of making mistakes is covalent with the possibility of making magic. It's not disco-punk but disco-hippy, and with each new effort the team's pretence at starsailing becomes more pronounced. Which is not to say that these astral navigators don't have a formula. In fact, some have complained that hearing these remixes back-to-back makes their formula a bit too pointedly clear; for example, remixes of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Mars, Arizona"" and Gorillaz's ""Dare"" share the exact same disco-rock to noisy freak out trajectory (of the two, ""Mars, Arizona"" wins out simply for compressing the trajectory more ruthlessly). But a formula ain't necessarily a bad thing: Think of it as a carefully considered training technique, designed to flex and strengthen certain sonic muscles in aid of achieving ever more impressive results. The duo's remix of Goldfrap's ""Slide In"" (reserved for the sequel to this volume) is the formula's pinnacle, as well as their most unashamedly psychedelic effort to date, moving seamlessly from blocky live disco to a shamanist wipe-out somewhere between Can and Orbital. Ewan Pearson claims that it inspired him to make his own 15-minute, two-part ""Disco Odyssey"" remix for Goldfrapp, and it's fitting that in this environment of sonic cross-pollination and oneupmanship, the DFA return the favour on their Pearsonesque remix of the Chemical Brothers' ""The Boxer"", a synth-laden Balearic house number that shimmers with unabashed gorgeousness. Alongside the stark, eerie techno balladry of their remix of Hot Chip's ""Just Like We (Breakdown)"" it's this compilation's most starry-eyed and astonishing moment. All of which suggests that the DFA's finest and furthest-out work may lie yet further inside dance music's sticky and intimate embrace.","The DFA collect mostly early 00s remixes for Le Tigre, Metro Area, and Fischerspooner, highlighting the duo's understanding of disco as a space of infinite possibility.

Reenacting here both the times they first immortalized looping entreaties to ""shi-i-i-iine,"" and complaints that, ""I still don't know what I'm here for,"" it's still clear what they're here for: 2005's Oceans Apart improved greatly on the Go-Betweens' previous comeback effort, and provides That Striped Sunlight Sound with its peppiest tracks: ""Here Comes a City"", ""Boundary Rider"", ""Born to a Family"", and ""Finding You"" are all extra-robust Red Bull anthems. But if pop's longtime sunshine-companionship is warranted, it makes tons of sense to call these vets the arbitrators of some striped sunlight sound. This live album comes like midday sun filtering through mini-blinds: barely-there slits, perfectly understated kind of cool (temperature-wise) sunny days alongside major chances of rain. And it comes with proof of what the Go-Betweens do best: the opposite of cloying-- perfectly aware, grown-up, and bittersweet. The low-key ""Black Mule"" and ""Clouds"" wouldn't otherwise resemble sold-out show material, but here-- spouted not from the mouths of babes but full-grown old dudes-- they're perfect, somehow. Sure we could gripe about the lack of favorites (where's ""Dive for Your Memory""?), but let's be grateful for what this is: After a long dry spell, ""Spring Rain"" has been a long time coming: ""Don't know where I'm going/ Don't know where it's blowing/ But I know it's finding you."" ""You"" meaning us, of course. Hand-clapped, whistled interims are proof that no band is an island, and the Go-Betweens are no exception to the rule: On That Striped Sunlight Sound, fans and cheesy concert-cheers are as indispensable as the guitars themselves.

He was more than just ""around,"" of course; he was also making history on his pioneering pop albums and the records on which he invented ambient music. But Eno seemed to be on hand for a sharp observation even when he wasn't directly involved. From his instant recognition of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" as a watershed moment in pop, his tireless championing of German bands that would later be canonized, to his role as the curator the No New York album, Eno was always understood to have exceptional taste. Perhaps that's why he saw such success as a producer, a job that requires above all that one be a good listener. In the mid-1970s, Eno was particularly enamored with the synthesized music Dieter Moebius and Hans Joachim Roedelius were making as Cluster. He traveled to the town of Forst, Germany, where Cluster lived and worked in their home studio, and began a collaboration that would result in two classic albums. The first recorded material to emerge from this meeting was Cluster & Eno, which was recorded in June 1977 at Conny Plank's studio, and suggested that the collaboration was completely organic. Eno's relentless sound experimentation helped Cluster get the most out of their synthesizers; the record is filled with textures that must have seemed otherworldly in 1977, but still manage to hold up today. The vibrato quiver of the Moog in ""Schone Hande"", for example, overflows with tension and mystery, soundtracking perhaps a hesitant exploration of a potentially hostile alien planet. Piano is in the foreground on ""Wehrmut"" and ""Mit Simaen""; at that time, a few notes on a baby grand with the sustain pedal to the metal brought to mind the furniture music of Satie and sounded terrific surrounded by wispy synths. On tracks like the warmly percolating ""Ho Renomo"", Cluster contributed a heightened ear for melody and an interest in repetition that pointed directly to where electronic music would eventually go. Cluster & Eno demonstrates that the parties had developed along parallel paths but discovered something new and fresh by working together. When they convened again a number of months later, the trio dropped the Cluster name and turned its focus in the general direction of song. After the Heat differs sharply from its predecessor in tone, as well as its English language titles and the occasional vocal presence of Eno. ""Most of the day we were at the machinery,"" he sings on ""The Belldog"", alluding perhaps to the creative ferment happening in Plank's studio. With evocative synths bubbling underneath, ""The Belldog"" sounds like a more technically sophisticated update of Another Green World, like the three had happened upon a new sort of music that would one day grow noisier and be called dreampop. For ""Tzima N'arki"", Moebius and Roedelius constructed an anxious simulation of a modern string quartet while Can's Holgar Czukay adds a dubby bass; Eno's vocals are played backward and somehow don't sound appreciably weirder than they normally do. ""If God had listened to me/ None of this would ever had occurred,"" is what he's actually singing; had they recorded this song in the late 1990s, I'd think he was talking about alternative rock. Eno does his talk/rap thing on ""Broken Head"", a menacing slab of slowburn funk with an unchanging bass and drums groove and strange noises spinning off in all directions. A few piano-centered instrumentals hint at the sound of the earlier record, but After the Heat exists in a fantastic sphere of its own. They'd made brilliant records before hooking up with Eno, but Moebius and Roedelius have never shied from acknowledging the impact the association had on their approach to sound. The two compilations bearing the title Begegnungen (German for ""encounter"") give an idea of the different ways those initial seeds sprouted. Adding Plank to the name of the project, both Begegnungen volumes compile tracks from the sessions with Eno along with contemporaneous solo and Cluster material in a similar vein. ""Johanneslust"" is a gorgeous solo Roedelius track from 1978, where he combines a simple acoustic guitar pattern with synths in a manner that reinforces the bucolic ""back to nature"" possibility of electronics. ""Nervös"" and ""Pitch Control"", both from 1983, bring the earlier experiments into the realm of 80s electro-pop. The former is solo Moebius with a grim layer of industrial soot, while the latter finds Cluster working with Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier to reclaim the stiff funk of Herbie Hancock's Future Shock for the European continent. In Moebius and Roedelius' favor, they never seemed bound by orthodoxy-- genre experiment came naturally to them, as evidenced by the title of their 1981 album Rastakraut Pasta. ""Conditionierer"" from Begegnungen II actually moves into the realm of hyper-minimal country & western, with a perky guitar groove and bottleneck slide. And then Roedelius' 1978 piece ""Mr. Livingstone"" gorgeously combines gamelan-style gongs with indeterminate far Eastern scales. Despite a dull patch or two, both volumes of Begegnungen are constantly engaging and full of surprises. The late 1970s and early 1980s were a fantastically exciting time to be making electronic music, as technology changed almost daily and possibilities expanded exponentially. In such a chaotic and unfixed environment, it took smart people with a strong musical sense to make the most of it. These guys fit the bill.",,8.7,
Peregrine,The Appleseed Cast,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a098c0084474cd0bfbf9/1:1/w_160/e452b24d.jpeg,2006-04-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/262-peregrine/,Militia Group,"Let me play devil's advocate for a minute vis-à-vis emo and post-rock. People who hate emo often do so for reasons that have little to do with the music-- they hate its cliquey cachet, its asymmetrical haircuts, its Hot Topic couture and predictable tattoos. An aversion to the music itself-- the stock dynamic changes, monochromatic vocals, oblivious self-obsession, and an obviousness that borders on emotional manipulation-- is almost an afterthought. Where emo is stylish, post-rock cultivates an anti-style, and people who are into vibrancy might find themselves turned off by its drab trappings and grave seriousness, not to mention the stuffy pretensions that can mar the music. To take the negative view, post-rock is cold, sterile, overly cerebral, and gives itself too much credit for rote gestures masquerading as innovations. Appleseed Cast's latest picks up more or less where Two Conversations left off-- if there's any difference, Peregrine is even more stately and impressionistic than its predecessor. I want to call this album ""post-emo,"" as it blends the better traits of each genre-- emo's warmth but not its grating bombast; post-rock's ambition but not its obscurity-- allowing them to temper one another. Whether the record scans as unusually adventurous emo or as unusually melodic post-rock is up to you, but I find this happy medium to be much more palatable than the lion's share of what each genre produces by its own lights. Despite its atmospheric trappings and intricate arrangements, Peregrine never loses sight of its grand melodies, which unfold with patience and restraint. The ice-blue arpeggios of ""Ceremony"" ring out bell-clear; offset by shuddering washes of noise in the background, they begin to wrap around themselves and are soon shattered by pounding drums. The shards coalesce like rewinding film several times before they blow apart into a final, triumphant cacophony. On ""Woodland Hunter (Part I)"", warm guitar chords and a muffled vocal melody levitate in the middle distance, then leap to the foreground for an outsized verse. The glitchy, staticky drums hop adroitly between channels; sonorous feedback stutters and blinks like reflected light, and one wants to make a crack about the emo Dntel, if the Postal Service didn't render it redundant. ""Here We Are (Family in the Hallways)"" strongly evokes Death Cab's ""Title and Registration"", from its tripping guitar line to its dreamy vocal melody to its floating, syncopated percussion. It still might be a little too gooey for post-rock diehards, but with Peregrine, Appleseed Cast just might have made an emo record for people who hate emo.","Indie band captures emo's warmth but not its grating bombast and post-rock's ambition but not its obscurity.

Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mixtape,Talib Kweli,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc16ea9e61561daa73bd/1:1/w_160/c28a328b.gif,2006-04-05 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4551-right-about-now-the-official-sucka-free-mixtape/,Koch,"Once upon a time I thought Talib Kweli and DJ Hi-Tek's Reflection Eternal: Train of Thought was the gold-standard of hip-hop. It had everything: beats, rhymes, more rhymes, some rhymes after that, and Dave Chappelle. Then, someone broke into my car and ran that shit, so I didn't listen to it for five years. A couple of months ago, I found it in a cheapo bin for three bucks. Turns out I mostly liked Hi-Tek, and Talib isn't his friend anymore. So here we have Right About Now, an ""official mixtape,"" whatever that means, released on clearinghouse label Koch Records, and stocked with leftovers and ornery jabs at the status quo. Sigh. Sometimes I get the feeling that Team Positive is playing to lose, like a Def Jam deal is the No. 1 draft pick or something. I respect Kweli for sticking it out, surviving on majors despite their questionable agendas, and give him sky-fives for trumpeting an alternative to crack-snap, but this is music not politics. And even if it were politics, it's the code of the stump: You can tell people what they need to hear, but make it jump. Follow it back to Mel, KRS, Chuck, the Tongues, whatever-- take it back to Robert Johnson if you feel like it. None disregarded the rhythm and the beat as frequently as Kweli. He's made a career out of doing that, and this is more of the same. A prime example is his duet with perennial NYC bridesmaid Papoose on ""The Beast"", which sounds like two dogs barking in a closet. If anyone is a bigger chatterbox than Kweli, it's the 'Poose, and the two of them together equals mental battery. Quiet storms like the clumsy ode to Lauryn Hill (""Ms. Hill"") accentuate the problem, a spacious beat provoking the loquacious Kweli to fill the gaps, which he does like a schoolboy asking out his first date. It doesn't help that the production on these two tracks is second-class, as are most of the beats here, cutout material from previous albums released as a purge before his next proper record. Most promising for that future material are the moments when Kweli jacks the swagger of the very gangsters he scolds. ""Drugs, Basketball & Rap"", with Strong Arm Steady, has Talib clipping phrases and showing uncharacteristic vigor over a Needlz bump, even when he drops a reference to Lemony Snicket. Collaborations with ol' pal Mos Def (""Supreme, Supreme"") and MF Doom (""Fly That Knot"") catch Kweli on his best behavior as well, encouraging him to loosen his collar a bit and follow the lead of his guests. The underappreciated Jean Grae, a recent signee to Kweli's Blacksmith imprint, joins Talib on ""Where You Gonna Run"", but by that point, what was meant as a showcase feels more like an obligation as the album trails off into its closing track. Talib Kweli will have more chances to duplicate the gold he struck with Kanye West on 2002's ""Get By"" because he's been tabbed as the conscience pro tem of CEO rappers like Jay-Z and 50 Cent. While neither of them signed him when they had the chance, his next record will be on a major. But, as Mos Def opens weekends and Dave Chappelle plans his escape route, Kweli is left to his own devices, and, to be honest, he has yet to prove he can succeed under those circumstances.","On this Koch release, subtitled The Official Sucka Free Mixtape, the indie hip-hopper sounds best when paired with guests like Mos Def, Jean Grae, and MF Doom.

Sorry I Made You Cry,The Czars,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cd5e6ef95969320e18/1:1/w_160/bdbbb070.jpg,2006-04-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1709-sorry-i-made-you-cry/,Bella Union,"The Czars have made a career out of crafting beautifully sad indie pop, sophisticated music centered on the downhearted vocals of John Grant. Grant's voice is pure and expressive, and with just the right amount of reverb it can cut straight through your sternum to your heart. In a sense, he's like Patsy Cline in a lower register, the way he allows himself to drift through an arrangement, carried as much by the circumstances of the lyrics as by the melody. Sorry I Made You Cry, the Denver band's fifth album, offers a good explanation of the similarity: Grant and his cohorts are evidently beyond smitten with Cline, as well as other forlorn country lasses like Connie Francis and Brenda Lee. A collection of covers recorded mostly for B-sides and compilations, as well as a few new tracks, Sorry features versions of three songs popularized by Cline out of its 11 cuts, with a nod each to Francis and Lee. The strongest critique you can level at this album is that it's relentlessly dour, playing each song for maximum sadness. Given the disparate recording dates, that's hardly a crime, just an unfortunate coincidence. When recording new tracks they might have taken pacing into account and put down one up-tempo song. The most aggressively depressive song here is a nearly nine-minute version of Rodgers & Hart's ""My Funny Valentine"" that wallows in a crawling tempo and features a downright jarring synth interlude that sounds like it wandered in from a late-70s Vangelis album. Webb Pierce's ""Leavin' on Your Mind"" (Cline's version seems to be the touchstone) and Gene DePaul's ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" (the Chet Atkins take is the closest forebear to this version) both sound nice, but sequencing them at 6 and 7 with their ultra-slow, ultra-sparse arrangements causes the middle of the record to sag a bit. More fun is the excellent version of Brenda Lee's ""I'm Sorry"". With just a strumming acoustic guitar providing rhythm, Grant and a searching pedal steel glide through the song's Western swing melody with amazing grace. The solo acoustic take on Cline's ""I Fall to Pieces"" works on the pure strength of Grant's voice, while he seems to really enjoy the iffy sexuality his delivery imparts to the unchanged lyrics of Connie Francis's ""Where the Boys Are"" (which, after all, was written by a man in the first place). The best thing here, though, is the cover of Abba's ""Angel Eyes"", which carries a rare lightness in its step and cuts straight to the poignancy of the lyrical tale noticing an old lover using the same old moves on someone else. Taken as an island, each song on here is very affecting, including the opening cover of Nina Simone's daunting ""Black Is the Color"", which starts with a repeating trumpet and piano figure and gives way to a vocal so beautiful that the song's racially loaded implications melt away. Its heaviness is balanced on the other end by a spacey version of Tim Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"", replete with echoing slide guitar and gentle shaker rhythms. As individually wonderful as some of these versions are, though, it's a bit much to take at once, making this a collection best taken in small bites.","Indie pop creators of sad, sophisticated music collect covers recorded mostly for B-sides and compilations, and add a few new tracks.

Sex Brain EP,The Black Swans,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b313d1975652138d88/1:1/w_160/25ffdce0.gif,2006-04-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1199-sex-brain-ep/,Bwatue,"The Black Swans hereby join the Faint and the Pink Mountaintops in having made short releases (tee-hee) about libidinal matters, but Sex Brain is no vamp-by-numbers affair: The focus is on the grievous awkwardness of physical longing, and of trying to articulate it without sounding macho, merely perverted, desperate, disloyal, or dopey. Bandleader Jerry DiCicca seems to be trying to sidestep the dueling fantasies perpetuated by most hump-hither music, electing to indulge neither the larger-than-sex, overly confident meat-machine approach, nor the sentimental, fluid-free, preemptively nostalgic lovemaker angle. The resulting quest-for-truth middle ground staked out by Sex Brain is, again, plenty awkward. Fans of how 2004's Who Will Walk in the Darkness With You could evoke a restrained, hellish dusk might be well surprised by this disc's spent, tragicomic dawn. Opener ""I Don't Want 2 Fuck"" is as upbeat and reticent as these proceedings get. ""It's all about me,"" the speaker admits, seconds before Canaan Faulkner's accordion suggests a sad Fazoli's in Ireland. DeCicca sings about spooning, ""getting weird,"" existential doubt, and the centrality of mouth-holes before the tune is over, in a voice that is just WTF bizarre. Imagine a stoned-but-bookish, seductive Muppet. Imagine a more fragile Tindersticks (Tenderdicks?), or that faux-comic-relief Jewish guy from ""Saved By the Bell"" if he was a game-spitting mack (The Teaches of Screech?). Either way, this tune stands alongside Naked Raygun's ""No Sex"", Sold Out's ""I Don't Want To Have Sex With You"", and Lust Control's entire discography in the canon of nocturnal-restraint advocacy. ""Friends"" is sung to a tequila bottle. If you've ever forgotten how you ended up in some depraved scenario, this joint's for thee. Hang on for the verse, ""She pulled my pants down/ And said she knows/ My girlfriend."" Memory and fidelity are complicated. Which leads to the ex-lover masturbation fantasy, ""Your Hands"", about olfactory flashbacks and wacking it to Bob Dylan albums, as Noel Sayre's violin weeps and plucks its pubes. ""Dark Plums"" is essentially an homage to the Black Swans' myspace-approved heroes the Dirty Three, a tension experiment seasoned by Horace Roscoe's eerie saxophone. The lyrics oddly go all metaphorical and euphemistic here, as the references to ""juice,"" ""butter,"" and ""jam"" clash with the directness elsewhere, as if even DeCicca wanted to buffer the strange fruit cultivated by bedfellows on the verge of trust (""Are we too good of friends to play?""). ""My Lips"" is a comparably sweet duet with Sara Jurcyk about post-orgasmic ennui. Its refrain, ""Never procreate,"" seems like an emotional prophylactic. My only previous associations with Columbus, Ohio, are the band Moviola and the novel The Right Man For The Job by Mike Magnuson, in which a dude kills a dog with a cinderblock and his girlfriend sets herself on fire. I did a local band search and found acts named Cleavage and Cameltoe to be recommendable, so maybe the place is throttled with a horndog vibe. While so many borderline smug avant-gardists are creating (self-conscious?) freak-folk, the Black Swans' attempt to freakify standard folk song structure, in terms of both Rick James' appetite for action and in terms of unbowed eccentricity, is welcome and laudable. That such atmospheric talents would take such topically riling chances suggests that this band actively seeks apologists instead of boosters, which is fine by me. More a bodice-tugger or fiddler than a ripper, Sex Brain really satisfices.","Latest indie rock band to join the Faint and the Pink Mountaintops in having made short releases (tee-hee) about libidinal matters.

Return to the Sea,Islands,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ae13d197565213aeea/1:1/w_160/c7040aee.jpg,2006-04-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4170-return-to-the-sea/,Equator,"After dropping their gloriously goofy and endlessly inventive 2003 LP Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?, the Unicorns became extinct. Following a brief resurrection as Th' Corn Gangg, a live side project in which Unicorns songs were recast as backing tracks for MCs like Subtitle and Busdriver, multi-instrumentalist Nick Diamonds and drummer J'aime Tambeur announced they'd soldier on without guitarist Alden Penner (née Ginger) as Islands. To prove it wasn't just another one of their bat-shit crazy antics, they leaked two mp3s: ""Abominable Snow"", an epic about surviving a yeti sighting, and ""Flesh"", which revealed a sweaty, sexy side to Diamonds' and Tambeur's songwriting. Both songs were outstanding and, just as important, sounded like the work of the Unicorns. (In fact, they were live staples in the band's last days.) But when Diamonds explained they wouldn't be on the new album and then gushed to Pitchfork about how the band's record would be, of all things, inspired by Paul Simon's Graceland, it was anybody's guess as to what Return to the Sea would actually sound like. It turns out that, while Diamonds' Graceland references weren't just snarcastic pranks, Return to the Sea is a sprawling, gorgeous collection of pop songs that draws from disparate sources such as calypso, country, and hip-hop. The record also relies more heavily on organic sounds and structure than the Unicorns' LP did: Where Who Will Cut Our Hair rewarded listeners with unexpected eruptions in the middle of songs or flat-out rockers dropped off a sonic cliff into plaintive minor chords, Islands present a more linear approach in their arrangements. Songs like album opener ""Swans (Life After Death)"" propel forward, picking up steam to the point of bursting. Only after ""Swans"" has marinated for nearly seven minutes, for example, does Tambeur abandon his shuffling and stuttering beats for cathartic, straight-ahead drumming. Islands' charm, then, is all wrapped up in the richness of the production: unusual instrumentation and tiny flourishes create dense compositions that demand repeated listening. For example, on ""Rough Gem""-- a song so insidiously infectious that trepanation may be the only way to get it out of your head-- the main riff is begun by an understated keyboard, picked up midway by plucked violin strings, and completed by a second, more cartoonish synthesizer. All the while, Diamonds cracks puns on his name, declaring ""I'm a girl's best friend/ Can you cut?/ I can cut!/ I'm a rough gem."" ""Volcanoes"", on the other hand, starts by layering meandering lap steel, intermittent triangle, and violins. By the chorus, those violins shed their hillbilly act to become soaring and angelic, like a melodramatic score. Against the strings, Diamonds strums chords and croons in his strained timbre, ""We washed our mouths at the riverbed/ When we noticed something glowing/ It was growing/ Things are going to change,"" before predicting a catastrophic volcano blast that melts Alaska and turns Argentina into some kind of ice land. The lyrics are ridiculous but fun, and ""Volcanoes"" fittingly features the album's most explosive finale, in which all the instrumental elements that have wandered in and out of the song converge for the song's climax. Return to the Sea is a case of Diamonds and Tambeur yanking up their anchor and setting sail for new waters, enjoying the freedoms of exploration and discovery. At no point in the record does it feel as if Diamonds is settling into any one genre or style-- hardly a surprise from this shape-shifting songwriter. It won't be a shock if, say, Diamonds and Tambeur announce 18 months from now that Islands is kaput and they're kickstarting another new band. And who really cares? As long as they continue to write songs as striking and immediate as the batch on Return to the Sea, their fans will follow them anywhere.

Sonic Youth / The Whitey Album / Psychic Hearts,Thurston Moore,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c69d034d5c69bf3148/1:1/w_160/2d7dafe9.jpg,2006-04-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11832-sonic-youth-the-whitey-album-psychic-hearts/,Neutral,"Another trio of remastered Sonic Youth-related reissues has surfaced, offering a glance at the band and its side projects amid this current period of serious downtown New York nostalgia and speculation. Why certain projects and albums were chosen over others isn't clear, but for now Geffen/Universal has spit-shined the 1982 self-titled debut EP, 1989's Madonna-fixated The Whitey Album (credited to Ciccone Youth), and Thurston's 1995 solo debut, Psychic Hearts. Beyond the requisite history lesson and catalogue gap-filling, the triad's dropped in anticipation of the band's 15th studio album, Rather Ripped, which is out in June, and maybe as a nod to Ecstatic Peace!, Moore's excellent experimental and noise label, teaming with Universal. All three albums have their moments, but the five-song debut gives the most band for your buck. Packaged with extensive (and worthwhile) liner notes from Byron Coley, Glenn Branca, original Sonic Youth drummer Richard Edson, and a note from Moore regarding the relation of reggae and Can to the tracks contained therein, Sonic Youth is also bolstered by seven live tracks and an early demo, all from 1981. Obviously more primitive than the quartet's later work, the recordings offer a ghostly, mesmerizing locked groove. My favorite aspect of the EP is the band's willingness to take its time: ""Burning Spear"" tries a hand at post-punk dub that swivels with Gordon's bass line and Edson's drum breaks. As Coley thoughtfully notes, that song's amazing sound of an airplane lift-off or wind filtering through a crumbled lofts is actually Ranaldo's ""contact mic'd electric drill"" filtered through wah. On the track, Moore's vocals are haunting and urgent, like he's pinned to a mattress on the floor of his East Village apartment: ""I'm not afraid to say I'm scared/ In my bed I'm deep in prayer/ I trust the speed/ I love the fear."" This is SY at their most icy; it's an erudite, windswept set, wrapping distortion inside danceable half-frozen Liquid Liquid beats. Even the EP's hand-drum rocker, ""I Don't Want to Push It"", is a gust of slush in a Bowery puddle. Moore takes over bass duties on the lengthy, jumpy instrumental closer ""The Good and the Bad"". Elsewhere, the bonus live stuff swelters: a super elastic ""Burning Spear"" is impressive and a rip-roaring version of ""She Is Not Alone"" contrasts the restrained studio take. If Sonic Youth's a chilly midnight haze, The Whitey Album tilts toward a confetti-lined karaoke jamboree. Finding the crew, along with Mike Watt (who offers liner notes penned in 1993), adopting Madonna's surname, Ciccone Youth are hopped-up on hand claps, drum machinations, lo-fi industrial, repetitious loops, and wily cover tunes. All that, and you get to hear Moore rap. Critics tend to highlight the sight gags like the meta ""Two Cool Rock Chicks Listening to Neu"", with Gordon and friend talking over a stereo about the possibilities of managing Dinosaur (Mascis shows up with a humongous guitar wail), that minute of Cagean silence, and Watt's cow-polk cover version of ""Burnin' Up"", which hits me like a disco take on his cover of Daniel Johnston's ""Walking the Cow"". (Historical note: Greg Ginn lays down an extra guitar.) That's fine-- these oddities are pretty choice-- but there are much better musical bits. Something you might not remember: The Whitey Album's packed with gorgeous instrumentals like ""Macbeth"", which piles up drum machines, fuzzing guitars, and catchy Cure-like chord rings. Opener ""Needle-Gun"" is Fat Albert-style No-Wave. There's also a bit of self-sampling: ""Platoon II""'s echo drums and gentle guitar drabs are a vocal-free take of the Gordon-fronted ""G-Force"". Of course, you'll also hear Gordon's cheesy, but wonderfully droll ""Addicted to Love"" and their most famous cover, an echo-dub implosion of Madonna's ""Into the Groove"", recast as ""Into the Groovey"". Released after Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star and joined by Steve Shelley on drums and Tim Foljahn on second guitar, Moore's femme-themed solo debut, Psychic Hearts, is a collection of often-beautiful sunset guitar rock. Of his vocal turns, my favorite is the caffeinated, teen-angst/dysfunction of the propulsive title track. Moore's vocals are also particularly swoon-worthy on the whispery ""Pretty Bad"" and breathy ""Ono Soul"". Most of Psychic Hearts, however, works because of the simple repetitions of instrumentals like lilting opener ""Blues From Beyond the Grave"" and the gently paranoid ""(I Got a) Catholic Block"" patterning that surfaces between Moore's voice in ""Feathers"". The centerpiece is the 20-minute instrumental exeunt, ""Elegy for All the Dead Rock *s"". The track's distinct movements mingle fluidly, swerving into a sideways cascade before bursting and blooming until notes sharpen and a final tidal wave arcs and releases. The noise implosions of its final third are anti-climactic, but after some gentle plucks and slides, Moore grabs his pick and glides into that dark night as gorgeously as he began, only this time with more triumphal drums. God, Sonic Youth's catalogue is vast. For even the biggest fans, it can take a reissue to suggest refocusing on something you've previously taken for granted. (Proust fans are nodding in agreement.) Psychic Hearts was, for whatever reason, still pretty embedded in my memory, but I had mostly forgotten the precise, trashcan regality of the EP. The Whitey Album, something I'd relegated to the Mr. T Experience section of my memory, was the biggest surprise: Collecting dust in my closet, this fucker has some incredibly catchy and flat-out kick ass and moving moments. If you've never heard any of this stuff, take a peak at what your guitar heroes were up to when they were a tad younger. If, like me, you assumed you'd moved past it: Go back and realize you haven't.",,8.2,
You Are There,Mono,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a213d197565213bd93/1:1/w_160/86a308f8.jpg,2006-04-04 06:01:23,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5402-you-are-there/,Temporary Residence,"Music, they say, is universal, but that's always been a naively romantic notion-- it often doesn't even translate across countries that speak the same language. However, the Esperonto ideal does hold true in one exceptional case: climactic, noise-heavy post-rock. It's the rare genre where you find bands from locations as far-flung as Iceland (Sigur Rós), Texas (Explosions in the Sky), Quebec (Godspeed You! Black Emperor), Scotland (Mogwai), and Japan (Mono) cultivating international fanbases by doing pretty much the same thing: being very quiet, then being very loud (preferably, over the course of 15 minute songs). And though all of these bands deal in mostly instrumental terms, the extremities in which they operate rarely leave room for interpretation-- Sigur Rós even went so far as to spell it out for you on their T-shirts: ""Avoid apocalypse, buy hope."" But the question posed by Mono's fifth album is, how much hope can you buy before you max out your credit? There's a conservatory-like studiousness to You Are There, each dramatic device and solemn guitar melody introduced with such delicate, resolute deliberation, you can practically hear the quartet flipping their sheet-music pages. Steve Albini's cavernous recordings lend the material an air of fear and uncertainty, but for all the reverberating guitar lines, thunderous timpani marches, and ungodly distortion piled upon each track, the songs only have two places to go: up and down-- sometimes at the exact same intervals. Both the 13-minute opener ""The Flames Beyond the Cold Mountain"" and the 15-minute ""Yearning"" begin as uniformly desolate, funereal elegies before hitting their seismic crash-endos around the seven-minute mark and lingering until every last ember has flamed out. Mono's fuzz-pedal fireworks are impressive in their sheer volume and vigor, but there's rarely the sense the music is ever going to fall apart, steer off the rails, or even change pace; these emotional roller coasters stay within the legal speed limit and come with extra-secure seatbelts. Only closer ""Moonlight"" (also a 13-minute commitment) betrays any signs of loosening, with a limbering space-rock sway that climbs up the back half of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"". Mono are generous enough to offset You Are There's four colossal tracks with a pair of serene, three-minute pieces (the glockenspieled lullaby ""A Heart Has Asked for the Pleasure"" and the string-sweetened piano pastorale ""The Remains of the Day""), and even if these brief respites work better as bathroom breaks than stand-along songs, they're ultimately necessary: after an hour of getting your heartstrings tugged with such intense proficiency, You Are There starts to feel no less egregiously manipulative than hearing Celine belt out ""My Heart Will Go On"" for the thousandth time in a Vegas ballroom.","Latest album from the Japanese instrumental post-rock group displays a conservatory-like studiousness.

Sweet Spot,Yura Yura Teikoku,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab269d034d5c69bf3f8f/1:1/w_160/37ab8335.jpg,2006-04-04 06:01:22,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8919-sweet-spot/,Sony,"Yura Yura Teikoku have experienced about as much success as an underground rock group can in their native Japan. Their following has grown steadily in the almost 20 years since they began as a four-piece, psychedelic garage band, despite enduring countless lineup changes. In the meantime, they've leapfrogged from their own tiny label to various larger indies and finally to the majors, each time gaining wider exposure and more popularity. At this point their music can even be found in Japan's famous karaoke bars, allowing patrons to drunkenly experience their own version of the band's psychedelic freakouts. Yet Yura Yura Teikoku have remained virtually unknown outside of their home land. While their concerts sell out in minutes in Japan, they've only played elsewhere a small handful of times. If the crowds at two N.Y. appearances in 2005 and the buzz since those performances are any indication, however, then it would seem that the band is poised to make a name for themselves stateside. After all, the U.S. underground has a history of adoring Japanese psych rock imports. But whereas Acid Mothers Temple and DMBQ utilize walls of noise and swirling instrumentation, Yura Yura Teikoku have streamlined their sound, creating psych-pop that can be quiet and sparse one moment and infectiously catchy the next. Sweet Spot begins with its longest track, ""2005 Nen Sakairyoko"", a minimalist exploration of bluesy psych-rock. Everything starts quietly, from the high-hat and rimshot beat to the plucky, reverbed guitar. Frontman Shintaro Sakamoto's distorted vocals are right up front, though, and as the track progresses, they are joined by the various hums and buzzes that threaten to smother the instruments to death. ""Robot Deshita"" is built almost entirely on a simple drum beat until tinkling piano and mechanical squeals segue into sci-fi noise about halfway through. Yura Yura Teikoku's earlier records were much more grounded in garage rock, and there are still a few tracks here that hearken back to that earlier, more primal sound. ""Kyusyo"" is this album's noisiest, with guitars layered to dizzying effects. ""Hate Ningen Ha?"" borderlines on B-52's territory with its catchy, twangy guitar line, and falsetto whooing throughout the verses. But the majority of the record is atmospheric and reserved, giving the instruments plenty of room to do their own thing. The band's voice is unique, and despite borrowing from many American bands from the 1960s and 70s, it's impossible to simply label Sweet Spot as a Japanese version of American psych-rock.","Underground rock legends in their native Japan, these psych-garage rockers are far too unheralded throughout the rest of the world.

Here's My Song You Can Have It...I Don't Want It Anymore/Yours 4-Ever Nicolai Dunger,Nicolai Dunger,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba38c0084474cd0c27c6/1:1/w_160/dab038e9.gif,2006-04-04 06:01:21,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11720-heres-my-song-you-can-have-iti-dont-want-it-anymoreyours-4-ever-nicolai-dunger/,Zoe,"Nicolai Dunger is a serial collaborator. He's forged a career out of fruitful partnerships with artists open-minded enough to follow his lead but with a different enough approach to keep things interesting. In addition to working and touring with Calexico, Emiliana Torrini, and Sufjan Stevens, Dunger recorded the bucolic Tranquil Isolation with Will Oldham; the Soundtrack of Our Lives were his backing band on This Cloud Is Learning; and the Esbjorn Svenssons Trio jazzed up his songs on Soul Rush. For Here's My Song You Can Have It... I Don't Want It Anymore/Yours 4-Ever Nicolai Dunger (which gives Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... a run for its money and still comes up 80 words short), he teamed up with Mercury Rev. For someone who has pinned his musical identity to so many others, it's impressive that these collaborations are so naturally balanced that each resulting album sounds distinct but still like the work of Nicolai Dunger; each is a point on a steady line, with no illogical jumps in between. Mercury Rev, who also co-produced Here's My Song, create baroque pastoral settings for Dunger's songs, reminiscent of their own albums but less otherworldly. Gentle guitar lines weep over a stone-stepping piano melody on ""Country Lane"", and an organ thrums suggestively on the eight-minute ""The Year of Love and Hurt Cycle"". Tambourines, spoons, and ragtag percussion jangle rustically on ""Way Up High"", while a regiment of horns storm in and out theatrically, interrupted by a doo-wop break. More inventive than Soundtrack of Our Lives and less chillily austere than Oldham, Mercury Rev prove to be his most dynamic partners, framing his songs but never infringing on them. Dunger always remains in the foreground, but with that malleable voice, how could he not? As a vocalist, Dunger is most often compared to Van Morrison or Jeff Buckley, but here his songwriting and singing are obviously patterned on American soul music, suggesting vocalists like Al Green or Sam Moore. He sounds more purposeful in his performance: projecting on ""My Time Is Now"" and ""The Year of Love and Hurt Cycle"", pulling back for softer moments like ""White Wild Horses"" and ""Slaves (We're Together Like)"", and investing ""Hunger"" and ""Someone New"" with lusty commitment. Whether this sensitivity to the demands of the songs is practiced or intuitive-- or whether it's the result of singing more demanding material-- seems beside the point. Dunger creates enough drama to fill the stage Mercury Rev has set for him, his quiet vibrato like an aside to the audience.","Serial collaborator teams with Mercury Rev on this baroque, pastoral record.

King,T.I.,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bec0084474cd0c0ec9/1:1/w_160/2c658cb7.jpg,2006-04-04 06:01:20,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8319-king/,AtlanticWEA,"T.I. has always been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other mainstream rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 was the album T.I. should've made. Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done. All that changes on King. From the opening seconds, something is different: low ominous strings, a regal horn fanfare swooping over funk guitars, and eerie horror-movie pianos welling up from some unseen abyss. The track's producer, Just Blaze, never makes tracks for Southern rappers, but here he's given T.I. a monstrous banger, something very few rappers will enjoy in their careers, and the emcee takes it like it's his birthright, stretching his drawl over the hectic boom like he just didn't have anything better to do. Over the first four tracks, nothing lets up. Texas legends UGK revisit one of their classic trunk-rattlers on ""Front Back"", and T.I. sounds like he's doing them a favor. Single ""What You Know"" is truly epic, DJ Toomp's swollen synth woozily curling up and T.I. eating the track for lunch, beating Jeezy at the ad-lib game before delivering one of those choruses that gets stuck in your head all day and you don't even mind. And ""I'm Talkin' to You"" brings back Just Blaze again, laying down horn-blats with Bomb Squad urgency and T.I. coming heated and dangerous as fuck, utterly destroying some unnamed opponent (""How many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more/ Than niggas twice as old, more popular and even selling more?"") before busting out a head-spinning double-time flow on the last verse. When the dust finally settles, it's for ""Live in the Sky"", a maudlin but pretty ballad, T.I. bitterly lamenting dead friends before going on to regret his own mistakes, the storied seven felonies that mean his life could basically end after one slip-up, Jamie Foxx gingerly cooing the chorus. And so the rest of the album goes, excising the weak and awkward bits that marred his other records. T.I.'s confidence seems effortless and second-nature, his self-aggrandizement turning relentless and convincing. If anything has been lost in his metamorphosis into aristocratically vicious Machiavellian monarch, it's his uncertainty, the touchingly awkward humility that crept into his voice when he begged neglected kids for forgiveness on Trap Muzik's ""I Still Luv You"". But that stuff had to go-- as did the ugly bursts of misogyny that would occasionally surface. When he talks to women now, he's conversational and courtly. On ""Why You Wanna"", he leans over the languid house pianos from Crystal Waters' ""Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)"": ""What, he think he too fresh to show you that you're the best?/ Compliment you on ya intellect and treat you with respect?"" On ""Goodlife"", he pulls off two miracles at once: making the Neptunes' recent schmaltzy Vegas-lounge glide sound good (not even Jay-Z managed that too often) and beating guest Common at his own fondly melancholy nostalgia game: ""I was born into poverty, raised in the sewage/ Streets will always be a part of me; they made me the truest."" And on ""I'm Straight"" he's right at home on, lazily bragging over lilting 1970s-soul flutes and wispy guitar twirls, next to a hard, greasy B.G., and a gasping, larger-than-life Jeezy. Even the album's most glaring misstep, the weak r&b; track ""Hello"", finds T.I. talking warmly to the girl who left him, which is nice. He can do that. He doesn't have to prove anything anymore.","Excising the weak and awkward bits that marred his other records, the Atlanta emcee's confidence here seems effortless and second-nature, his self-aggrandizement turning relentless and convincing.

Musique Vol. 1 (1993-2005),Daft Punk,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8805e6ef95969321213/1:1/w_160/e276063a.jpg,2006-04-04 06:01:19,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2138-musique-vol-1-1993-2005/,Virgin,"If you're the type who's noticed Pitchfork's gradual ideological shift away from considering indie rock the de facto center of the musical universe, you've probably also cottoned on to Daft Punk's unique standing within that world. Revered in DJ circles, respected on singles charts, and still the dance act you're most likely to hear at an indie party, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have retained an improbable portion of their life force over the years-- despite being flogged alongside the likes of Fatboy Slim and the Prodigy at the altar of electronica in the late 90s, birthing videos arguably more iconic than their songs, and keeping the most leisurely release schedule this side of Kate Bush's home office. Maybe there was something to the presentation. It seemed so gimmicky at first, a couple of hams in robot masks, mugging for the camera. That corny French sensibility was conceivably one misstep away from a drippy house remix of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" or ""Popcorn"" or ""The Pink Panther Theme"". What we didn't realize was that it was designed for longevity. Whether in the splashy logo or the robot packshots, each ensuing Daft Punk release has arrived with only slight variations on the theme. But now, almost a decade later, is there another dance act from the ""120 Minutes""-era that doesn't seem downright anachronistic in 2006? Norman Cook's Hawaiian shirts, Tom Rowlands' yellow specs, Keith Flint's bald-hawk and jackboots-- all aspirational rockstar images that run counter to dance music's needs by drowning it in nostalgia and making it difficult to locate in the here and now. In comparative terms, Daft Punk have little of that attendant baggage. They are now exactly what they always have been-- something less like people or rockstars and more like complicated engines. Their machinery is their songs, and beyond that, there is nothing. Despite its stuffy title (we'll get to that later), this greatest hits collection actually picks up in 1995, which is when Daft Punk started releasing the string of 12s that led up to Homework, their 1997 debut. It's probably still their best-known era, and Musique features no fewer than six tracks from it, including the underrated title song as well as no-brainers like ""Da Funk"" and ""Around the World"". You've heard them, you love them, and you probably don't really need them on another disc, but strung back-to-back like this, they're still pretty overwhelming. So far, so good. Here's where it gets inexplicable. Of the remaining tracks here, only six are originals, which means a criminal three from 2002's Discovery (full disclosure: this is one of my favorite records of all time) and a criminal (for different reasons) three from 2005's Human After All (full disclosure: Discovery is one of my favorite records of all time). Not only are ""Aerodynamic"", ""Voyager"", and ""Digital Love"" (!!) snubbed in favor of 2005's ""Technologic"" and ""Human After All"", but slam-dunks like ""One More Time"" and ""Around the World"" appear as inferior radio edits. It doesn't help that three very capable but ultimately immaterial Daft Punk remixes (of tracks by Scott Grooves, Ian Pooley, and Gabrielle) are lamely tacked on to the end. Not only do they take up real estate that would have been more wisely earmarked for Musique's glaring omissions, their curious inclusion suggests higher-than-ordinary levels of label involvement. In other words, small potatoes conspiracy theorists who believe Daft Punk intentionally shit the bed on Human After All so as to accelerate their split from Virgin will have no shortage of material to work with here either. Assembled chronologically, with thoughtless deference to proper singles over tracks and an undiscerning ear for Daft Punk's actual best work, this is a maddeningly incomplete record that has all the hallmarks of a contractual obligation. What saves it is the cumulative thrill of hearing a decade's worth of Daft Punk singles in sequence and once again realizing they're a better act with two-and-a-half albums than most are with five.","With a few inexplicable single edits and an undiscerning ear for the French duo's best work, this compilation-- despite containing mostly fantastic tracks-- reeks of contractual obligation.

Dixie,Flin Flon,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a59d034d5c69bf2789/1:1/w_160/018015f9.gif,2006-04-03 06:01:28,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3104-dixie/,Teenbeat,"For more than two decades, Mark Robinson has left his bewildering mark on indie rock, most notably in the seminal Unrest, the underrated, if short-lived Air Miami, and now Flin Flon. Robinson's is a quirky legacy. He's just as likely to lovingly spoon-feed you sugary pop as he is to make you take your medicine in the form of uncompromising sonic experiments. Look no further than the shrill, sustained tone of ""Volume Reference Control"", which introduces Unrest's Imperial f.f.r.r., for an example of Robinson's penchant for noise (and, apparently, tormenting dogs). On Dixie, Flin Flon's third album since forming in 1997, the band appears to be heading down the same road. To fulfill the experimental quota, the record is book-ended by two punishingly hyperactive drum solos, ""Cavendish"" and ""Capstick"", courtesy of drummer Matt Datesman. It's a screwball way to begin and end an album, but it immediately ushers you into the world of Flin Flon-- which hasn't changed much since the last visit. The band still sounds like some precisely engineered machine: slick and polished, but somehow sterile. Datesman's rumbling drums and Nattles' ubiquitous bass create an airless backdrop for Robinson's single-note guitar spikes and chiming chords. Flin Flon are always tight, but these songs are almost choked to death as the band seldom shifts tempo or uses silence or space to add depth to the compositions. One exception is ""Trafalgar"", which opens with Robinson's brittle, ringing guitar and a more subdued bass line from Nattles. By the time Datesman's percussion enters, it's playing a supporting role instead of indulging in a free-for-all of non-stop fills. In another peculiar decision, Dixie's drum solos are followed and preceded by alternate versions of the same song, ""Cardigan"". It's probably the album's standout, but even ""Stairway to Heaven"" only appears on one side of Led Zeppelin IV. On ""Cardigan"", Robinson gives us a dose of his oblique lyrics, relying on suggestion rather than anything concrete to describe a rocky relationship: ""Rip, torn/ Nice sweater/ Nice fabric/ Nice way to create a distraction."" It's an approach that has long served him well and is suited to the music's sharp edges. The aspiring geographers among Pitchfork's readership may have noticed that every song title mentioned from Dixie refers to a place in Nova Scotia-- or that the band's name itself is a city in Manitoba (""a picturesque mining community and tourist paradise"" boasts the city's website). While Robinson's obsession with Canadian place names is pretty weird, it's also an interesting way to think about Flin Flon's music. Like a cartographer who leaves no location on a map unnamed, Flin Flon sticks to familiar territory on Dixie, never truly exploring its sound or venturing into the unknown.","Third album from an indie band led by former Unrest leader Mark Robinson is typically confounding and unique.

"Soul Jamaica Shake, Vol. 1",Sound Dimension,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d713d197565213928d/1:1/w_160/713617b5.jpg,2006-04-03 06:01:27,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7851-soul-jamaica-shake-vol-1/,Soul Jazz,"It's difficult to believe that this is the first compilation devoted solely to the Sound Dimension, among the lead authors of one of popular music's greatest chapters. The Sound Dimension reshaped the signature Jamaican afterbeat of ska and rocksteady into the sturdy, versatile riddims of reggae, and the instrumentals they created are still being used as the basis of scores of songs to this day. The early days of reggae, the late-60s, saw the birth of the first remix culture, where the basic rhythmic backing tracks of popular vocal hits were given lives of their own, often with the vocals replaced by instrumental solos or keyboard experiments. The Sound Dimension were the house band at Coxsone Dodd's Studio One, and much like Motown's Funk Brothers, they backed dozens of singers on hundreds of hits in their few years together. Unlike the Funk Brothers, though, they were also a widely acknowledged outfit in their own right, with singles bearing their name and a corresponding place in the public eye. The group essentially evolved from the Skatalites after that band imploded following the murder conviction of trombonist and guiding force Don Drummond. Originally known as the Soul Vendors, they changed their name after returning from a UK tour, rechristening themselves after an echo unit Dodd had purchased in England. You can hear that very unit on the guitar, answering each upstroke on songs like ""Doctor Sappa Too"" with an offset response, an afterbeat after the afterbeat. Soul Jazz's tracklisting leaves out most of the band's best-known tracks like ""Real Rock"", most of which are available on Heartbeat's Downbeat the Ruler compilation. Instead it mixes a few high-profile songs with a ton of cuts that had previously been available only in Jamaica. It's a funky disc, full of great, skanking rhythms and fine playing by some of Jamaica's most revered musicians, including Leroy Sibbles, Cedric Brooks, Jackie Mittoo (barely in his twenties at the time and already a seasoned vet), Ernest Ranglin, Rolando Alphonso, and Vin Gordon. The jazz upbringing and training of many of those musicians is apparent in the lyricism of the saxophone and trombone leads, while ""Love Land"" and ""Soul Shake"" nod to traditional Rastafarian music with the inclusion of burru hand-drumming, similar in rhythmic style to the hand-drumming of Senegal's mbalax music. Mittoo was one of the band's leaders, and his unique keyboard style is a major part of the music's appeal. Mittoo uses bright, unaffected organ tones, and his playing has a melodic meander to it that cuts nicely through the tight horn arrangements and frequently wah'd-out guitars. The best songs tend to have the most fully fleshed arrangements, with thick horn sections and great leads, like the classics ""Heavy Beat"" and ""Full Up"". You might recognize ""Upsetters Dream"" as the backing track of Carlton & the Shoes' ""Love Me Forever"", but it sounds quite good on its own, with a beautifully understated wah guitar lead from Ernest Ranglin. A bit of early toasting shows up on a couple of later tracks, ""Holy Moses"" and ""Hail Don D"" (a reference to Drummond), but it adds little, as it hadn't developed to the point it would in dancehall and dub. There are a couple of songs that feel like they're missing something-- samples waiting to happen, essentially, and it's easy to see why these tracks are versioned so often, as the rhythms are all rock solid and the chord changes aren't too out of the ordinary, meaning you can go in a lot of different directions from the source. It's refreshing to see the Sound Dimension achieving recognition in their own right for their huge contribution to reggae. More to the point, though, it's clear from this release that they were more than just a backing band, and that the music they made stands well on its own, albeit usually with an overdub or two. Hearing this music in relation to the hits by Alton Ellis, Jon Holt, Dennis Brown, Bob Andy, Slim Smith, Don Evans, and others whose backbones these tracks formed is hugely entertaining as well, though you'll have to track down those songs on your own. If you're attached to those vocalists or Jamaican singing styles generally, then you may find this disc a little lacking, but if you're looking for a deeper understanding of reggae and where it came from, this will help you find it.","Soul Jazz issues the first collection of tracks-- both well known and rare-- from the house band at Coxsone Dodd's Studio One.

Killing Time,Massacre,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c380eb335119a49ed717/1:1/w_160/282aedb0.gif,2006-04-03 06:01:26,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5684-killing-time/,CelluloidCelluloid,"Avant rock in the early 1980s was a very different beast than in the preceeding decade. After punk and new wave, DIY experimentation, electronic music, and a healthy cross-breeding of scenes via all manner of unlikely collaborations and manifestos-- playing six degrees of separation with musicians from the late-70s and early-80s could easily make bedfellows of a pop star and a no wave anti-celebrity-- bands who might've been content to play just prog or free improvisation or deranged blues began throwing everything into a blender and skronking out whatever they could. Predating today's noise-rock scene-- and earlier acts like Boredoms, Ruins and John Zorn's Naked City-- the first wave of 80s experimental rock musicians had few precedents for their brand of noise, but they did have the ability to choose amongst a huge variety of source material to integrate into their cacophonous attack plans. Heads of the class were This Heat, Material, the Work, Ornette Coleman's Prime Time, James Blood Ulmer, Last Exit, and the international trio Massacre. Massacre formed in New York City in 1980, after British guitarist Fred Frith had moved there following the demise of his former band, Henry Cow. After hooking up with Material bassist Bill Laswell and drummer Fred Maher, the band recorded a single record in 1981 before disbanding. And they totally killed it: The tunes on Killing Time represent one of the greatest possible ends for the concept of a power trio circa early-80s downtown NYC. Taking hints from no wave, Massacre's music had a generally chaotic, breakneck pace, focusing each member's considerable musical abilities on jagged, squealing ""melodies"" and an angular yet blurred attack. Some of the music sounds improvised (reminiscent of earlier Henry Cow live stuff, or even mid-70s King Crimson), but the pulse never wavers; momentum never falls below a menacing rumble. ""Legs"" is a hybrid of early Devo and Discipline-era Crimson, with atonal guitar lines, pointed phrasing and that unmistakable proto-dancepunk pogo beat. Laswell's rubber band punch underneath the head makes an already feverish tune seem all the more ready to burst, and when ""Aging With Dignity Takes Over"", the trio dives headfirst into apocalypse-beat. Frith sounds like Derek Bailey gone punk, and the primal drums and Laswell's strings being abused are certainly in keeping with the aggressive, primitivist aesthetic. Perhaps that's the strangest thing about Massacre: They sounded as immediate and unsettled as a no wave act, but played everything like rabid musos. The title track blows everything out of the water, again hitting the hi-speed beats and ultra-dissonant guitar leads, sounding like submarine chase music-- paranoid and destroying anything in its path. ReR's reissue adds several live bonus tracks, including dark ambient pieces like ""You Said"", ""Carrying"", and ""Know"" that predate Frith's Death Ambient project of the 1990s. Conversely, ""F.B.I."" is something of a metal cowboy song, and reminds me of tracks on the first Naked City record where the band would start out playing a fake television theme only to erupt in splatter noise at seemingly random intervals. Suffice to say, Massacre are not for the faint (or musically conservative) at heart. After a long layoff, the band did regroup in the late-90s, though working with ex-This Heat drummer Charles Hayward instead of Mayer. The results were interesting, but to my ears, they never matched the focused intensity of Killing Time. Nevertheless, this record belongs in a pretty select group of great, instrumental avant-rock albums, and is one that should find a fan in anyone who doesn't mind a few shards of broken glass mixed in amongst their riffs.","Welcome reissue of the lone early-1980s downtown collaboration between Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith and Material's Bill Laswell and Fred Maher.

It's usually not quite clear what hip-hop is if it doesn't include this stuff; it's a subculture always reacting and almost never acting. Things Go Better With RJ and Al, the second album from the Columbus, Ohio duo of rapper Blueprint and producer Rjd2, starts out doing the worst thing an indie-rap album can do: furiously declaiming itself as being firmly and militantly on the indie side of the divide: ""No slogans, no 20-inch rims rolling/ No gold fronts, no publicity stunts."" The song, ""No Gimmicks"", is clumsy, reductive, and hookless. On the next song, Blueprint is still saying the same stuff: ""Rap nowadays is by a bunch of ignorant cats/ No 'Young, Gifted and Black', just guns, bitches, and crack."" So if this guy is so firmly devoted to the cause of real hip-hop that he'll spend the first two songs on his album bitching about the state of rap, the question becomes what, exactly, Blueprint thinks is real hip-hop. Judging by the rest of the album, Blueprint thinks hip-hop means Will Smithian joke-raps about hooking up with ugly girls when he's drunk or fools using up his cell-phone minutes. This should probably go without saying, but if you're going to insist that you represent the true heart of an art-form, it might be a good idea to actually have something to say. Fortunately, though, Blueprint is pretty good at this joke-rap stuff, and once he gets the bluster out of his system, he's a lot of fun, kicking good-natured punchlines and riding beats with affable warmth. And lucky for him, Rjd2 is just about the best producer in indie-rap, and his gooey classicist strut-funk has none of the exhausted emptiness that it did the last time he produced an entire album, Aceyalone's Magnificent City. ""I'm Free"" comes with a great hard-swinging horn riff and a biting funk-guitar sample, while ""Drugs, Sex, Alcohol, Rock-n-Roll"" builds on a nice distorted bass-stomp and 1970s flute-flecks before finally turning into an instrumental breakdown that sounds like vintage Blue Cheer. Seeming short at 40 minutes, it's a slight album, and it's marred by Blueprint's slavish devotion to his own goofy song-concepts, like ""I'm Free"", which uses the word ""free"" on every line. Blueprint also has a tough time with hooks (he usually just repeats a couple of words over and over and hopes that it suffices) and a troubling streak of churlishness, advising young women to never have sex on ""The Cool Thing to Do"" and telling the story of a girl who gets molested and ends up becoming a lesbian on ""Drugs, Sex, Alcohol, Rock-n-Roll"". But at least he resists the temptation of pointing out that ""Keys"" is about the little metal things that open doors.","Rjd2-- indie hip-hop's top producer-- pairs his gooey classicist strut-funk with the sometimes charming joke-rap of Blueprint.

Ringleader of the Tormentors,Morrissey,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c813d197565213bde7/1:1/w_160/f18eb4a2.jpg,2006-04-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5439-ringleader-of-the-tormentors/,SanctuaryAttack,"""I am a living sign,"" Morrissey sings on ""Vicar in a Tutu"", from the Smiths' 1986 apex, The Queen Is Dead. If the words evoke Morrissey's dual personae as myth and mythmaker, their religious overtones are a subtle reminder that he's also a never-quite-recovering Catholic. Though his 1990s relocation to Los Angeles, the sunny center of 20th century glamour, elicited little surprise, his recent move to Rome seems even more natural: There, the Pope of Mope can reel around the fountain of both Occidental culture and inexpiable guilt. From humdrum towns to giddy London, from Sunset Boulevard to the Eternal City, this living sign signifies, first and foremost, himself. Ringleader of the Tormentors is a new Morrissey album, not a new Morrissey; attempts to wring autobiographical revelations from its lyrics are easy, but ultimately futile. Accusations of self-parody, after losing their sting sometime around ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"", remain apt but, in Morrissey's case, often irrelevant. On his eighth solo album, the enigmatic warbler again sounds contradictory notes on love, death, the divine, and the despised. All that's really changed are his collaborators-- Ennio Morricone, T. Rex/Bowie producer Tony Visconti, guitarist/co-songwriter Jesse Tobias-- who trade the televised-car-chase production of 2004 comeback You Are The Quarry for a sound more akin to the glam-rock crunch of Your Arsenal. Rapturous self-torment-- particularly the chasm between love's possibility and its unrealized fulfillment-- was always the defining condition of the Morrissey experience. For Morrissey's narrators, love and death are two levels of the same double-decker bus-- a theme made explicit on lead single ""You Have Killed Me"", a strapping rocker reminiscent of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"". With Hammond organ syncope and Morricone strings, trembling ballad ""Dear God, Please Help Me"" likens lust to ""explosive kegs between my legs,"" while decorous torch song ""I'll Never Be Anyone's Hero Now"" places ""my one true love...under the ground."" As Moz idol Oscar Wilde put it, ""Each man kills the thing he loves."" Moz's interests were eloquently foreshadowed by another Catholic artist, Jean Genet, whose 1943 novel Our Lady of the Flowers laces its gay protagonist's exaltation of a beautiful male murderer with references to the Church. Likewise, Mel Gibson's 2004 The Passion of the Christ isn't just about homoerotic S&M. The famous mind/body dichotomy from ""Still Ill"" tellingly neglects the soul, but Morrissey still can't escape what he's called ""inbuilt guilt."" Even ""Dear God, Please Help Me"", Moz's most emotionally beguiling song in years, grows ambivalent at the moment inattentive critics have cited as the singer's coming-out: When Morrissey sings, ""Dear God, did this kind of thing happen to you?/ Now I'm spreading your legs/ With mine in between/ Dear God, if I could I would help you,"" is he addressing a lover, or a loving deity? On ""You Have Killed Me"", which contains some of this infamous celibate's most candidly sexual lines since Meat Is Murder-era B-side ""Stretch Out and Wait"" (or at least YATQ's ""Come Back to Camden""), the man who ostentatiously forgave Jesus two years ago ""for all the desire He placed in me"" slyly concludes, ""There is no point saying this again/ But I forgive you."" Even when contemplating mortality, Morrissey remains enamored of youth. A children's choir guests on multiple tracks, including fast-paced single candidate ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"". Their immature voices bestow hair-raising pathos upon a refrain almost too self-evidently jejune for the middle-aged Moz to sing alone: ""There is no such thing in life as normal."" The choir returns for ""The Father Who Must Be Killed"", an equally energetic knife-attack on a stern stepfather, which ends in eerie laughter. Elsewhere, Morrissey marks the passing of time more keenly, with even more overt auto-plagiarisms. ""It's the same old S.O.S.,"" he concedes amid the Roman rain, midtempo groove, and orchestral crescendos of the epic ""Life Is a Pigsty"". ""Even now in the final hour of my life/ I'm falling in love again,"" he adds, subtly acknowledging that love is not as new to his music as recent press has implied. Morrissey's poignancy, in his best solo work as in his vivid Smiths prime-- what critic Simon Reynolds once called ""a piercing beauty, or a sweet ache""-- often inflames the exhilarating terror of loneliness just as it elevates the sensations of love through comparison with Moz's unrequitable romantic perfections. The complicated gender roles, the ubiquitous allusions, the games of irony, art, and style serve equally to ignite a listener's curiosity. Ringleader of the Tormentors is, rather than the now-anticipated letdown, another fitting heir to that legacy. The living sign again: ""This one is different, because it's us.""","The Pope of Mope moves to Rome and becomes revitalized; with help from producer Tony Visconti, he explores rapturous self-torment with more passion and power than he's possessed in years.

Cannibal Sea,The Essex Green,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca9eb335119a49eccf2/1:1/w_160/05d0a557.jpg,2006-04-02 06:01:33,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2837-cannibal-sea/,Merge,"Holy second term, it's now three years further away from the 1960s than when the Essex Green last invoked that era's blithe folk-rock. Apparently the band noticed, too: On Cannibal Sea, the Brooklyn-via-Vermont Elephant 6 progeny who once insisted, ""I'll see you in the '60s,"" come to terms with Rupert-Murdoch's-MySpace era, though without straying too far from their cherished influences. They're still cheery and hook-laden, although-- apropos of the times-- a little less innocent, a little less free. Where previous albums wore the same sepia patina of nostalgia cast by labelmates the Clientele, Cannibal Sea's most immediate track, ""Don't Know Why (You Stay)"", sparkles with new wave synths and itchy electric-guitar palm-mutes; Chris Ziter's lilting, faintly geeky vocals steering the tune toward the New Pornos more than the Cars. Ziter's harmonies with Sasha Bell are the most affecting moments on song and album alike. They're equally essential on Bell-fronted freshmaker ""Elsinore"", while ""Penny & Jack"" does windswept mid-80s British. These here are streamlined pop machines; they take few chances but always do the job. Sure, presentation's more Now, but the compositions still hearken the usual back-in-the-day way. Opener ""This Isn't Farm Life"" shoots a Motown charge into either/both the Kinks' ""Victoria"" or Belle & Sebastian's ""Like Dylan in the Movies"", as Bell tosses off lines about the Iliad in her deceptively plainspoken voice. ""Snakes in the Grass"", complete with well-timed rattles, borrows the powwow stomp of Paul Revere and the Raiders' ""Indian Reservation"", amid Revolver-flanged vocal responses that represent one of the disc's too-rare nods toward the band's vaguely psychedelic history. Ziter sounds like an actually singing-enabled Ringo amid the seaworthy acoustic guitars of ""The Pride"". By the end, it's 40 minutes later, you've been to a wintry ""Sin City"" that's actually just Ohio, run down the ""Rue de Lis"" like Paul Simon singing ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" to ""Homeward Bound"", and gone all Watership Down English folk for ""Rabbit"". The difference, as between fellow Merge band the Rosebuds' debut and sophomore albums, is a greater engagement with the prevailing indiepop aesthetic rather than long-dead flower-cliché epochs, though without quite the songwriting chops of Bell and guitarist Jeff Baron's other band, Ladybug Transistor.","Merge's Elephant 6 progeny come to terms with some contemporary sounds without straying too far from their cherished 1960s influences.

What You Will,Ahleuchatistas,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a192c0084474cd0bfe2d/1:1/w_160/5ee960f4.jpg,2006-04-02 06:01:32,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/433-what-you-will/,Cuneiform,"""Remember Rumsfeld at Abu Ghraib"" trumpets the first song on Aheluchatistas' third album. While I can't remember Donald Rumsfeld physically at Abu Ghraib, I get the message-- he was there in essence as a guiding force. And with that, another Ahleuchatistas album is off and running like a dog with five legs, the rhythms weird and asymmetrical, cropping up in meters nearly impossible to keep track of, and rarely simple or familiar. What You Will doesn't put a lot of stylistic distance between itself and the Asheville, N.C., trio's two previous albums, but on several tracks it displays a boost in compositional maturity. The tension and release feel more organic, and though jarring jump-cuts are still plentiful, there's often more of a sense of purposeful contrast. On ""Remember Rumsfeld"", dig the way Shane Perlowin's stridently unaffected electric guitar sticks stubbornly to those slow, mournful figures even as the bass and drums egg it on with frenzied outbursts. Each note quivers into adjacent quarter tones, and when the band finally coalesces, it heads off on a martially unified path of mayhem. It's weird to hear a contemporary band stick so militantly to the basics, relying on guitar, bass, and drums without distortion or an overdub. ""Ho Chi Minh Is Gonna Win!"" opens with a mind-blowing patch of groove, with palm-muted guitar hitching a ride on Derek Poteat's burbling, almost Chris Squire-ish bass, and then streaks off on a series of wild tangents á la King Crimson's ""Great Deceiver"". Toward the middle, drummer Sean Dail settles on a simmering ride cymbal pattern, which Perlowin coats with chiming guitar, creating the prettiest moment Ahleuchatistas have put on tape to date. The band operates in pretty unforgiving territory, and naturally not everything works. ""Sometimes There's a Buggy"" gets bogged down in a repetitive midsection and has little sense of structure. The track feels like it has the seeds of several other, more interesting songs in it, but it never blossoms itself. The music suffers at other points from a lack of repetition-- a phrase flees too quickly or a passage doesn't return. ""Shell in Ogoniland"" has an especially bad attention deficit, stabbing in about 18 directions at once. Thankfully, most of the songs come together as they should-- ""Maybe Orange"" switches deftly between tension-building passages and bursts of off-center groove, while ""Sherman's March"" assembles itself from dystopian chaos into the most straightforwardly brutal rhythm the band has hit on yet. What the band's success comes down to, though, is that they're astonishingly together even on passages where it seems downright impossible to stay in sync. You don't get the impression that they're virtuosos or even trying to be, just that they're a very single-minded entity. Playing instrumental rock with a setup this basic, that single-mindedness is essential.","Beefheartian instrumental trio offer their third album of politically informed, complex compositions.

Vision Valley,The Vines,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95dea9e61561daa5a10/1:1/w_160/c9966f5e.jpg,2006-04-02 06:01:30,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8473-vision-valley/,Capitol,"If the first time is tragedy, and the second time is farce, then what would you call it the third time around? Around these parts, the Vines have been a farce from the start-- adding up the numbers Pitchfork writers attached to their first two albums would barely get them past 6. Well, here are some points to get these sassy kids over the ever-loving ten point oh mark. If these three albums get released on one CD, it will be so awesome. As it stands, what the Vines offer on their third album is permutations and refinements on what they've been doing since whenever. On the stupid loud songs, Craig Nicholls sounds like a bored Kurt Cobain. On the stupid slow songs, Craig Nicholls sounds like a bored Liam Gallagher (which is pretty impressive, given Gallagher's innate inertia). To the group's benefit, the exhibitions of ennui available on Vision Valley cut out before the 3:00 mark. (That excludes ""Spaceship"", the group's six-minute Pink Floyd Stadium Tour moment.) A lot of tracks barely make it past two minutes, which works great for the hyper-ironic first single, ""Don't Listen to the Radio"", and ""Nothin's Comin'"", one of the better Nirvanabee tracks. Brevity does not help when you call a song ""Futuretarded""-- cowbell or no cowbell. Of course, track length is immaterial when your trippy dippy psych-psoaked buzz ballads are wearing out their welcome before they find that confounded bridge. ""Take Me Back"" is country-fried Vines, complete with twangy guitar lead-in. ""Going Gone"" is wonderwalled Vines, complete with string section. And if one's source of inspiration is the overworn ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" (as it is on the title track), then one needs to go back to the drawing board and chuck the tracing paper. And that's the short of it. This album's greatest failing is that there's nothing here. There's nothing remotely offensive about Vision Valley that can inspire any sort of righteous fury about the musical hegemony. Unless you're offended by the f-bomb-- there are bits of f-shrapnel sprinkled throughout, to provisionally lend proceedings a certain edge that no amount of power chording can truly hone. And there's nothing musically offputting about this record, unless relentless mediocrity in the three-chord arts is a capital crime. Subjectivity being what it is-- the Vines are the Vines are the Vines. They're good at what they do, even if what they do isn't all that good. They have their fan base. They have inroads to get a song into some commercial and on Jack FM stations. They have a budget to make videos that will get them face time on MTV2's Subterranean. And, in two years, they'll have another album out that (if previous efforts are any indication) will sound a lot like this one. Maybe they'll tap into some unforeseen creative vein and surprise everyone with their Brave New Direction, or actually write more than one or two decent songs per album. Until that happens, though, you know what you're getting if you're buying this album. And you're probably not going to like it.","Third album from the ""new rock revolution"" leftovers that the NME once called ""the Australian Strokes.""

At War With the Mystics,The Flaming Lips,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb813d197565213b5da/1:1/w_160/d8622091.jpg,2006-04-02 06:01:29,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3086-at-war-with-the-mystics/,Warner Bros.,"There's a moment in last year's documentary, The Fearless Freaks, where Wayne Coyne is playing a song he was writing during the time of the Clouds Taste Metallic sessions. With only his strumming to accompany him, Wayne sings, ""Cats killing dogs, pigs eating rats..."" The song is ""Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus With Needles"", and on its way to actualization, it will acquire a weird intro and a stranger instrumental bridge, and will be puffed up large and colorful enough to suit the rest of that big, glowing album. But even as Coyne plays it alone on guitar, you can hear something special. Listening to At War With the Mystics-- the Flaming Lips' first new album in almost four years, and the product of many months in the studio-- it's difficult to imagine a similarly inspiring glimpse into one of these songs' construction. Much of the record sounds like chords and melodies were written later, as an afterthought to flesh out production experiments. The goofy noises, glitches, and wafts of Wilsonian harmony in ""Haven't Got a Clue"", for example, seem to be more central to the track's focus than the melody (of which there is almost none) or the lyrics (""Every time you state your case/ The more I want to punch your face""). But the sounds are certainly interesting. At War With the Mystics has already been discussed as the band's Return to Rock or Return to the Weird, but I don't really hear those things. Some of this talk arose because among the first of these tracks to emerge was ""The W.A.N.D."", a good song built on a gnarly guitar riff-- a combo we haven't heard from these guys for some time. It doesn't approach the force of, say, ""Slow Nerve Action"", but this is the best guitar rock they've produced since Clouds Taste Metallic. Still, it's not indicative of the record as a whole. Instead, At War With the Mystics is a grab bag of musical styles, without ever seeming like a retread of any particular album or sound they've explored during the course of their 20-year career. Though the themes are cut from the same cloth as the last few records-- meditations on fear, death, love, one's place in the universe, and so on-- musically, the band is up for experimenting. The production is distant, queasy, fuzzier, and less direct than any of their recent outings; the vocals are often manipulated and toyed with-- Coyne goes from singing in a register so low you can hardly recognize him (the single ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"") to one so high that he sounds like Beck doing Prince (""Free Radicals""). Musical mastermind Steven Drozd even sings his first lead, on ""Pompeii Am Götterdämmerung"", one of the record's better songs, a peculiar amalgamation of several strands of krautrock and Pink Floyd's ""One of These Days"". While the band has always played around with a variety of sounds, when you get down to the nuts and bolts of songwriting, most of Mystics doesn't measure up. It's telling that their best melody since The Soft Bulletin was written by Cat Stevens, and when the Lips make more traditional song compositions their focus, the results here are rarely engaging. At War With the Mystics leaves me wondering whether making good records is really the point for the Flaming Lips at this juncture. With this album, I'm struck by the possibility that the Flaming Lips are an idea and a project as much of a band, and records are just one of the organization's many concerns. This doesn't seem like any great tragedy, and I've no question that many tens of thousands more people will get into them this year for the first time and find their lives enriched by what the Flaming Lips have to offer. But for the first time in more than 15 years they've made an album that is difficult to consider great, regardless of how it's approached.","Indie legends' first new album in four years-- widely tipped to be the group's return to a more guitar-centric sound-- is stylistically diverse and colored by distant, queasy prodcution.

Feathers,Feathers,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13ac0084474cd0bfd72/1:1/w_160/c9ff2e2d.jpg,2006-04-02 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3364-feathers/,Gnomonsong,"Looking (and often sounding) as though they've been sent directly from central casting, the psych-folk octet Feathers originate from the same fertile New England climates that generated the wayfaring likes of Tower Recordings and the MV & EE Medicine Show. The arrival of their debut album on Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong label has not gone unheralded, since the group have built a promising reputation through their guest appearances on Banhart's Cripple Crow and opening for such acts as Sufjan Stevens, Dinosaur Jr., and Smog. In addition, Feathers' Kyle Thomas and Asa Irons perform alongside J Mascis in the sweet-leaf metal combo Witch, an outfit whose recent debut provides this ethereal album with a valuable textual counterpoint. Home recorded and originally self-released on vinyl, the music on Feathers exists largely in the bucolic countryside previously occupied by the Incredible String Band, Comus and their progressive brethren. This might lead skeptics to dismiss this spirited collective as just another escapist hippie revival. Yet throughout the album the casual sophistication of Feathers' arrangements-- as well as their firm grasp of dissolute, post-Siltbreeze dynamics-- helps these performances achieve a distinct emotive depth and a gauzy, out-of-time luster. Four of the group's eight members contributed to the songwriting, and at least that many help furnish vocals. And while this multiplicity of perspective lends the album a constant variety of shade and nuance, it never distracts from the essential fellowship of Feathers' quiet, communal flutter. The surprising elegence of the group's vocal interplay is evident almost immediately in the opening minutes of ""Old Black Hat With a Dandelion Flower"". Layered with ripples of acoustic and electric guitar above exotic percussion that curiously recalls Dr. John's 1968 voodoo-psych classic Gris Gris, this track is resplendent with the easy vocal harmonies of Meara O'Reilly and Ruth Garbus, with Kurt Weisman's falsetto adding a sweetly off-kilter wobble to the gentle din. Later on, relatively forthright folk-rock songs like ""To Each His Own"" and ""Past the Moon"" are enlivened through Feathers' deft instrumental flourishes, as discrete elements of cello, mandolin, lap-harp and birdcalls are inserted between their mirrored rays of quicksilver guitar. Affairs become slightly more unhinged on ""Van Rat"", an oddball structure of whistles, stray radio waves and inscrutable lyrics that reference monkeys and robot arms. As is the case with Witch, here Feathers' persistently ornate and hard-to-decipher lyrics are delivered without a trace of irony. This earnestness can give seemingly fanciful tracks like ""Silverleaves in the Air of Starseedlings"" an unsettling, vaguely sinister undertow, an effect further amplified on ""Ibex Horn"" by a mixed chorus of shadowy whispers. The clouds part, however, on the guileless anthem ""Come Around"", an irresistable call to nature that carries the album off with a spring-like gust of extra-potent oxygen. Coupling their graceful, intuitive musicianship with a resolute outward-bound gaze, Feathers appear ready to join the elite of the avant-folk underground, and ideally this will be the first of many passages through their peaceable, separatist kingdom.","Psych-folk band-- who've made appearances on Cripple Crow and opened for Sufjan Stevens-- issue its debut album on Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong imprint.

Boo Hoo Hoo Boo,They Shoot Horses Don't They?,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bdea9e61561daa58c7/1:1/w_160/72c422b4.jpg,2006-03-30 06:01:38,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8318-boo-hoo-hoo-boo/,Kill Rock Stars,"The proliferation of ""wolf"" bands in the aughties has been described often enough for the riff to attain the narrative polish of an old stand-up routine; it might as well be included in Blogger's startup template. As this meme tips toward cliché, might a paradigm shift be on the horizon? It's too early to call 2006 the Year of the Horse, but if it proves true, then Band of Horses will be remembered as the band that defined ""horse"" music as opposed to ""wolf"" music. Putting aside the Superwolfs and Patrick Wolfs of the world, wolf music is malevolent; it darts and lunges, beady-eyed and razor-toothed. By contrast, horse music, as exemplified by Band of Horses, is noble and graceful, with the potential to restore to indie music an equilibrium reviled by conniving wolves. But this prospective equine aesthetic falters before it even breaks a trot: They Shoot Horses Don't They are wolves in horse's clothing. Boo Hoo Hoo Boo consistently subjugates the song to unconvincing primitivism. This Vancouver-based octet is one of those bands that can take a little bit of everything-- twitchy mariachi rhythms, bombastic klezmer horns, big-top pageantry and found-item drumlines, cabaret-punk vocals, and guitar-rock snippets-- and turn it into a whole lot of not much. Boo Hoo Hoo Boo is deliberately enervating and wolfishly provocative, but doesn't offer enough substance to compensate for the jangled nerves. TSHDT's ace in the hole is the brass section, which manages to be giddy, magisterial and catchy all at once, and the songs on which the horns take center-stage are the best of the bunch. On ""Lowlife"", they lean into a mighty swing sturdy enough to hold up the weight of the spleeny vocals, and on ""Apple"", they sear an imposing melody across what would otherwise be another tepid Birthday Party encomium. For a music with lyrics like ""I'm gonna form a new religion/ Living in the woods and eating bugs"", the album seems awfully civilized-- individual parts that aspire to a state of chaos fall in orderly rank and file, each clearly discernible, and no palpable sense of danger or abandon ever resolves. The broken typewriter rhythms and rubbery bass tones of ""Emptyhead"" have the potential to be compelling, but unfurl too rigidly to scan as more than vertices on a grid. The Mark-E.-Smith-as-drawling-cowboy mien of ""Three"" seems to strive toward corniness, and succeeds. But to what end? Intentionally corny is still corny. The woozy guitar gallop, squiggly horns, and incantatory vocals of ""Hiccup"" are not without interest, but as a chorus of screams evokes a more obvious take on ""Grass"", it's hard not to feel like you're drinking the purple stuff to Animal Collective's Sunny D. I think TSHDT would be a blast to see live, but in recorded format, they're hedging their bets-- an album that found them either really surrendering to musical anarchy or writing the pop songs that Boo Hoo Hoo Boo implies they could write would serve them better.","Indie band employs twitchy mariachi rhythms, bombastic klezmer horns, big-top pageantry and found-item drumlines, cabaret-punk vocals, and guitar-rock snippets on its KRS album.

And it's perhaps with this idea of cured preservation in mind that NYC's Mouthus present their fourth (or so) full-length album, The Long Salt. Using a brutish selection of electronics, busted guitar, percussion, and time-collapsed vocals, the duo of Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson here sound as though they intend to stun their unsuspecting listeners then embalm them in a boggy avant-rock brine. As with contemporaries like Hair Police or Sightings, Mouthus appear to simply enjoy rock dynamics too much to participate entirely in a faithless, full-scale deconstruction. Their 2005 Troubleman album Slow Globes was one of the most inspired free-rock artifacts of recent vintage, incorporating acoustic instruments and even a deranged interpretation of Fleetwood Mac's ""Storms"" into the duo's brutal yet microscopically attuned psychedelic mayhem. For their follow-up, however, Mouthus have thickened their tongues and dampened their precision, and the resulting work is embedded with some of their sludgiest, least navigable arrangements to date. In addition to the release of Slow Globes, 2005 saw Nate and Brian collaborate with members of Double Leopards in the volcanic quartet White Rock. And the savage influence of the Leopards definitely seems to have rubbed off here on mulching, drone-heavy tracks like ""The Burns of Them"" or ""What Knife Say."" Carried by hyper-attenuated sheets of delayed vocals and outstretched electronics, ""The Burns of Them"" is as close as Mouthus have come to forsaking all rock-based propulsion, with Nelson's maltreated drum kit buried somewhere out back with a rag in its mouth. Elsewhere, however, ""WL"" reduces the post-punk formations of the Birthday Party or the Fall down to a raw skeleton of dangling nerves, filling the air with indecipherable jargon and concussive drumbeats that ring like pistol shots. Guest musician Samara Lubelski (Hall of Fame, Tower Recordings) adds molten strands of violin and vocal to the cyclonic hum of ""Ghetto Stairs"", while ""Ziggurats"" spins like a broken flywheel, studded with the sort of stray electronic particles that might be cast off by Whitehouse. Yet throughout their earth-eating frenzy, Mouthus' idiosyncratic but graspable rhythms and murky riffs seep in under the floorboards. Beneath its heavy curtain of Dead C-inspired distortion, ""What Knife Say"" courses with a surprisingly refined near-melodic grace, as Sullivan's garbled, impassioned vocal directives remain just a head above the music's choppy currents. And while The Long Salt might ultimately scan as little more than a lateral move away from the obscured peaks of Slow Globes, an occasional dip in its astringent waters should be enough to illustrate its cleansing and restorative powers.","NYC band use a brutish selection of electronics, busted guitar, percussion, and time-collapsed vocals on this Important release.

So why does Stephin Merritt have to go and make a Showtunes album when everybody who didn't know Stephin Merritt liked showtunes has worse problems than rockism? And, while we're killing Santa and finding out where the falafel cart guy washes his hands post-pee, here's another obvious bliss-buster: Cool, jazzy pop dude Sondre Lerche likes cool, poppy jazz. I totally know! Yup, the 23-year-old Norwegian kid whose delovely 2004 traipse Two Way Monologue taught you the difference between augmented and diminished chords totally digs him some Chet Baker-- not just the trumpet stuff, either. Backed, like Baker on his 1958 Sings It Could Happen to You, by a deft quartet, Lerche steps away on Duper Sessions from the mild psychedelia of his two all-original albums. Instead, with walking bass, and clean, close-miked production, he breezes through a smart smattering of new and standard material. Lerche has always been something of a jazz-style interpreter. On previous albums, the frameworks for Lerche's skee-doo-doodling melodies also include Nick Drake and the Beach Boys, but great tunes sometimes get tripped up by incomprehensible lyrics (beats my Norwegian though). But despite solid backing here, he doesn't sing like Baker, let alone Frank Sinatra; his soft Ben Gibbard geekiness is an odd, if timely, fit for the swinging material, and flourishes of Jeff Buckley throat rattles don't help. His take on Cole Porter's ""Night and Day"" is as call-me-unexceptional as the take on Porter's ""The More I See You"" he funny valentined for a Starbucks comp alongside Madeleine Peyroux. A piano-led run on tourmate Elvis Costello's ""Human Hands"" doesn't go too Harry Connick, while a cover of likeminded English group Prefab Sprout's 1988 ""Nightingales"" slowly tinkles more like wind chimes than songbirds. Fortunately, the best of Lerche's originals blend right in with-- and actually work better than-- the remakes. ""The Curse of Being in Love"" starts with clean, lightly syncopated guitar as Lerche sings of the joy of new romance vs. the horror of mature love-- ""It won't get better""-- before a delightful, if not unexpected, closing turn. Descending piano plays as large a role as Lerche's voice on slow, dewy ""Minor Detail"", and the Flamingos-like doo-wop waltz ""You Sure Look Swell"" coaxes out the wine glasses almost as easily as Baker's classics. Still, for all the potential post-Norah Jones appeal of a record like Duper Sessions, it mostly just whets the appetite for Lerche's next album, where one hopes Baker-style standards will again serve merely as an ingredient, not the entrée. Who knows where this guy's hands have been? Merritt can keep doing showtunes, though.","Indie pop singer-songwriter teams with the Faces Down Quartet for a record of poppy jazz, complete with walking bass and clean, close-miked production.

Neither album, however, is quite able to fully deliver upon its initial tantalizing premise, instead simply becoming two more enjoyable but ultimately inessential additions to the already unwieldy AMT catalog. It should presumably be no bombshell to suggest that a new Acid Mothers Temple album title might be something of a non sequitur. But with its King Crimson/Black Sabbath mash-up artwork and title, one might expect Starless and Bible Black Sabbath to be the full-scale prog-metal spectacular that AMT have been hinting at for years. This line-up of the Cosmic Inferno-- featuring the powerhouse rhythm section of ex-Zeni Geva bassist Tabata Mitsuru and dual drummers Shimura Koji and Okano Futoshi-- has the firepower to deliver such an extravaganza. Yet although there are accents of Sabbath lurking in the dank corners of the album's two extended tracks, Kawabata can't resist setting his controls for the furthest reaches of Ursa Minor, returning to the familiar acid rock regions encountered on 2002's Electric Heavyland. As with many of AMT's recent works, Starless and Bible Black Sabbath is dominated by a single epic-length track. Here, on the 30+ minute title track, the Cosmic Inferno abandon the Gong-inspired stoner motorik of last year's IAO Chant in favor of a lumbering, grungy riff that sounds frustratingly spindly, and too lacking in bottom end to truly conjure Sabbath. At any rate, there's certainly little of Tony Iommi's foursquare influence audible in Makoto's continual soloing, as he spends nearly the entire length of the track furiously exploring his guitar's scorching upper limits. Though his virtuosity can be jawdropping in smaller doses, here his strenuous repetitions will likely prove a serious test for the sober listener's patience, as will Higashi Hiroshi's increasingly intrusive sci-fi keyboard effects. The spirited thrash of the following ""Woman From a Hell"" helps restore some visceral momentum, but does too little to entirely rescue Starless and Bible Black Sabbath from the province of missed opportunity. More successful, and considerably more chaotic, is We Are Acid Mothers Afrirampo, recorded with the assistance of crazed female avant-garage duo Afrirampo. The hot-wired twosome of Oni and Pika have made cameos on previous Acid Mothers Temple records, and Makoto issued Afrirampo's first album on AMT's own label, but this is the first attempt at a full-length collaboration between the two groups. Using a damaged collection of percussion, toys, recorders and ecstatic vocals, Afrirampo inject these proceedings with their own distinctive brand of deranged garage rock and Fluxus-tinted bubblegum, while Makoto and crew work graciously to keep up. The heavy-psych of the opening title track soon gives way to a prolonged breakdown of childlike vocal gibbering, before the guitars of Makoto and Oni again combine for some mutual post-No Wave jamming. ""The Exorcist of Love"" initially sounds like one of Acid Mothers Temple's pastoral folk interludes, but soon scurries away into loopy Joe Meek tape effects and slow-building electric crescendos. And ""The Man From the Magic Mountain"" combines all these various subjects to an extremely disorienting effect, as space-age electronics rub anxiously against plumes of violin and Afrirampo's savage human wails. Recalling everything from the Shaggs to early Red Krayola, the album yields most of its feral charms upon one or two careful listens, but does suitably translate what must have been an absolutely insane couple of hours in the recording studio. The scariest thought of all is that it sounds like Acid Mothers Temple and Afrirampo, if they so chose, could conceivably get together and record an album just like this every week. So if you plan to keep up, you had better start clearing your shelf space now.",,6.0,
Hand Cranked,Bibio,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46fea9e61561daa4ee2/1:1/w_160/459a48dc.jpg,2006-03-29 06:01:43,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1138-hand-cranked/,Mush,"Two records in, Stephen Wilkinson's Bibio project has carved out a clear niche for itself. Wilkinson is a pretty fair steel guitar player; his music essentially consists of recordings of him doing his thing and then processing the results in very specific ways. Every word I can think of to describe his music begins with the first letter of his last name: It sounds worn, weathered, woozy, warped, warbling, and warm. Wilkinson clearly loves folk and a certain strand of idyllic electronic music equally, and has found an efficient place for the two to meet. Bibio's amorphous debut Fi came from nowhere, like something found underneath a moss-covered stone on a morning walk. Here on Hand Cranked he seems to have whittled his signature style down to a rather fine point. As someone who adores the sound of acoustic instruments bent and treated with common distortion, I'm willing to allow Wilkinson enormous latitude when it comes to his narrow production obsessions. Virtually every track here features plucked guitar treated in a small handful of ways, with the highs and lows filtered out (to give the old radio illusion of age) and on tape that just can't manage to maintain its speed. It's something a lot of people will tire of after a short while, but the sonority he manages somehow keeps me consistently engaged. What's not working for me is Wilkinson's approach to songwriting. One bad habit he seems to have picked up from more recent Boards of Canada-- who first brought him to the attention of the label Mush-- is a tendency to use ridged loops of short phrases as the basis of composition. On the bulk of the tracks he plays two or three bars on one chord, then two or three bars on another, and then back to the first, ad nauseum. Though other subtle bits like backward leads and strands of drone are dropped in and out, the tracks in general are circular and static, without any particular reason for lasting any particular length of time. I can't help thinking that if Wilkinson were to take a few additional pages out of Ye Olde Book of British Folk and incorporate song and ballad chord structures into his work, while maintaining the aged recording techniques, he might really have something. The few tracks where he breaks out of his usual mold are far and away the most satisfying, particularly ""Abberiw"", a vocal track on which Wilkinson sings quite well (he sounds a tad like Robert Pollard, actually). I don't doubt we'll hear more from Bibio, but there's not much here to separate Hand Cranked from the slightly better debut.","Following his amorphous debut, Fi, the Mush artist has whittled his signature guitar style down to a fine point.

Out of the Ashes,Jessi Colter,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a754ea9e61561daa556b/1:1/w_160/ccf2d4f6.jpg,2006-03-29 06:01:42,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1834-out-of-the-ashes/,Shout! Factory,"Not many performers could get away with such an obvious and sentimental metaphor as a phoenix rising from the ashes. It's such a transparent symbol that it practically dictates the emotional touchstones that follow: grief, determination, tribulation, and triumph. Jessi Colter, however, makes it sound genuine and poignant, if not necessarily new, on Out of the Ashes, her first album in two decades. That alone is one reason she can get away with it; this record is obviously a new start for her. More crucially, this is her first album since the death of her husband and collaborator, Waylon Jennings. As such, it's a statement of coming to terms and moving on-- somewhat predictable, but Colter makes it work with a brassy performance and a well-rounded selection of songs. Colter wants to stress the point that while she's been through some hard times, she's far from dead or defeated. On ""The Phoenix Rises"", a patient ballad about starting over, she sings, ""New beginnings are hard to find/ New beginnings are mountains to climb."" She's still got her powerful voice, her memories of her husband, and the comfort of friends and family, many of whom guest on the album. She deals with these issues on the album's numerous ballads, including the centerpiece ""Out of the Rain"", which features backing vocals by Tony Joe White and Jennings himself, who recorded his parts before he died. On ""Please Carry Me Home"", Colter is joined by her son Shooter Jennings, but his roughly textured voice sounds more at ease on his own rock-country albums and doesn't really blend well with his mother's. These big statements of rebirth and recovery can be almost overwhelming in their autobiographical significance. Fortunately, Colter peppers the album with more upbeat numbers that don't have such heavy personal baggage but still showcase her well-aged voice. With its bluesy stomp and Colter's brash putdowns, ""You Can Pick 'Em"" sounds like Car Wheels-era Lucinda Williams, and her cover of Dylan's ""Rainy Day Women #12 & 35"" sounds almost like desert country psychedelia. She's at her best on ""Velvet and Steel"", a raunchy duet with guitarist Ray Herndon that's full of sly sexual innuendo. Even Don Was' dry, too-tasteful production, which evokes a well-funded studio more than Colter's beloved Arizona landscape, can't diminish the impact of these songs. From the too-precise guitars on ""You Can Pick 'Em"" to the too-tasteful cello on ""So Many Things"", his production buffs away any blemishes and robs crucial moments of their intimacy and directness. A few more rough edges might have given Colter's ruminations on loss and life a little more force and made this comeback all the more memorable.","First album in two decades from the country singer is also Jessi Colter's initial release since the death of her husband and collaborator, Waylon Jennings.

Beat Romantic,Talkdemonic,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8baea9e61561daa58bf/1:1/w_160/a35e4c09.jpg,2006-03-29 06:01:41,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8316-beat-romantic/,Arena Rock,"On the cover of Beat Romantic, the sophomore release from Portland, Ore.'s Talkdemonic, we see a path strewn with branches and grasses winding toward the horizon through a thick stand of birches. It's a gorgeously idyllic scene: the trees' slender white trunks, the canopy of green. But there's something decidedly unnatural about the image. The hall-of-mirrors symmetry smacks of digital manipulation, of a version of nature enhanced by technology. The same can be said of Talkdemonic's instrumental post-rock, which lays a bevy of acoustic elements over a foundation of pulsing programmed beats and modulating, soft-focus synthesizers. The duo acquiesces to this tension, cheekily dubbing their music ""folktronic hop,"" a hybrid genre that seems to have its roots in records like Bjork's Homogenic. But, without a doubt, it's the players, not the preset laptop tracks, who lend Talkdemonic's music its emotional heft. Kevin O'Connor plays banjo, guitar, piano, and Wurlitzer on the recording, but it's his highly expressive drumming that is most memorable. When the punctuated rhythm of programmed percussion gives way to cascading cymbal crashes and spacious break beats, it's nothing short of cathartic. And viola-player Lisa Molinaro's performances ooze with feeling, as beautiful swells of strings render the need for vocals understandably dispensable. The songs on Beat Romantic are dense sonic architectures, adding layer upon layer of melody and counter-melody as they grow. On album opener ""Veraison"", a truncated viola loop repeats for the song's duration, as Molinaro blankets it in a palimpsest of overdubs, her legato bowing countering the clipped repetition of the sample. ""Dusty Flourescent/Wooden Shelves"" begins with a misleading sense of restraint, all plucked banjo strings and roomy snare strikes. But 15 seconds in, O'Connor absolutely thrashes his kit as a descending bass line and ascending synth riff expand the background. Beat Romantic's highlight, though, is the one-two punch of ""Bering"" and ""Human Till Born"". Teeming with soaring harmonies, ""Bering"" features Molinaro's most affecting playing. As she abusively rakes the strings of her viola at the end of the song, the track segues into a feast of pummeling drums that would make DJ Shadow proud. While Talkdemonic's streamlined compositions avoid the trappings of more self-indulgent instrumental acts, at times, they could use a little more room to breathe. Many songs don't make it past two minutes, which results in the album unfolding like a single piece of nearly continuous music. Such unity is a credit to their sense of vision, even if it suppresses some of their best melodies in a kind of sameness. But, also like the cover's birch grove, Beat Romantic's allure isn't in isolated beauty, but the juxtaposition of so much of it.","Oregon instrumental post-rock duo lays a bevy of acoustic elements over modulating, soft-focus synthesizers.

Wayfaring Strangers: Ladies From the Canyon,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a842ea9e61561daa5797/1:1/w_160/a781086c.gif,2006-03-29 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2080-wayfaring-strangers-ladies-from-the-canyon/,Numero Group,"Released in 1970, Joni Mitchell's third album Ladies of the Canyon was a crucial document of the gradual segue of the tradition-based folk revival into a new movement of breezy, more introspective singer-songwriters. And while Mitchell obviously doesn't bear sole responsibility for creating the archetype of the long-haired, coffeehouse folk chanteuse, there is no question that her success quickly inspired hundreds of similarly reflective young female songwriters to pick up their acoustic guitars and join in quixotic pursuit of lucrative recording careers. As a result, the following years witnessed a deluge of regionally produced and distributed folk albums-- the vast majority of which eventually found their way to family basements and Salvation Army stores, as their winsome authors returned unceremoniously to quiet obscurity. Now, in order to better demonstrate the breadth of this movement and the astonishing reach of Mitchell's influence, the inveterate crate-diggers of the Numero Group present Wayfaring Strangers: Ladies From the Canyon. Diligently researched and compiled with the label's characteristic attention to detail, the collection gathers 14 impossibly rare tracks by female folkies from every corner of the nation, covering an era which spans roughly from 1971-76. Variously funded by parents, church groups or community organizations, these songs originally appeared on private-press albums that were issued in pressings as small as 50 copies, and each retains a certain undeniable handmade charm. The compilation appears at a time when reissues of unjustly overlooked folk singers like Judee Sill, Vashti Bunyan, Bridget St. John, and Linda Perhacs are still fresh on the shelves. Unlike those performers, however, few artists on Ladies From the Canyon project a musical personality distinctive or eccentric enough to carry an entire album. (Nor, it should be noted, are there any truly psychedelic notes ever played or sung.) In fact, the most striking aspect of this collection is the utter uniformity of its perfomances, not only in sound but in mood and spirit. Nearly all of these vocalists sing in a rich, Joni-like alto over spare arrangements of guitar and piano. And despite their differences in geography and background, each performer achieves a nearly identical sense of dreamy, melancholic longing, sounding content to leave the wider dynamic range of rage, lust, joy, and defiance (not to mention humor) to a separate generation of female artists. It would take a hardened heart, however, to ignore the simple beauty evident in tracks like Collie Ryan's gorgeous, haiku-like ""Cricket"" or Priscilla Quinby's nautical ""With All Hands"". And, as one might expect from such a ""real people"" collection, a couple of these tracks possess that indefinable, unschooled strangeness that is peculiar to outsider art. The most engaging such example is Shira Small's eliptical ""Eternal Life"", with its casual declaration that ""Eternal life is the intersection of the line of time and the plane of now."" Not to be outdone, the haunting ""Maybe in Another Year,"" is sung by Peoria teen Jennie Pearl with a clear-eyed innocence that recalls the best moments of the Langley Schools Music Project. Also noteworthy is 15-year-old Ellen Warshaw's surprisingly forceful and harrowing take on the Stones' ""Sister Morphine"", one of the few cuts that feels out of keeping with the collection's overall earth mother vibration. Most of the performers on Ladies From the Canyon have long since retired from the music business. One notable exception is Barbara Sipple, who has since gone on to a successful career as an opera singer, and whose ""Song of Life"" is one of several here that is tinged with the mystic, soft-focused Christianity typical of the era. As further evidenced by tracks like Carla Sciaky's ""And I a Fairytale Lady"", there is constant yearning that courses through nearly all of these songs, a yearning for some external force-- be it Jesus, a waylaid Prince Charming, or simply a record contract-- to come and deliver each singer from her lonesome solitude. But as Ladies From the Canyon amply illustrates, these scattered, isolated voices were actually far from alone, and maybe their inclusion here within this fascinating time capsule can provide some small echo of the communion they once sought to gain through their long-neglected music.","Latest from Chicago-based Numero Group focuses on Joni Mitchell-influenced coffeehouse folk, mostly recorded during the first half of the 1970s.

"Lullabies to Violaine: Singles and Extended Plays 1982-1996, Vol. 1 / Vol. 2",Cocteau Twins,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1189d034d5c69bf289f/1:1/w_160/6417d89d.jpg,2006-03-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11702-lullabies-to-violaine-singles-and-extended-plays-1982-1996-vol-1-vol-2/,4AD,"Of all the acts to have circulated through the list of my personal favorites, the Scottish band Cocteau Twins have always been the one that's impressed me most. This is because their music, at its best, offers nearly everything I want out of pop records. The list of things I want is long and complicated (I hope), but start with just this one abstract thing: This band is absolutely unique in its vision and sound, and yet that uniqueness is an integral part of creating something beautiful. That's rarer than you might think. The things that are special and adventurous here aren't competing with beauty and accessibility. Neither are they merely coexisting with them-- they're actually the same things. The Cocteaus' best songs seem to be creating whole new sorts of beauty and energy, from scratch, and something about that gets to the root of what a lot of us want music to do in the first place. Like a lot of UK bands of their era, much of that terrific Cocteau work was released on EPs. In fact, the band made terrific use of the format, giving each 12"" a distinct aesthetic, from the sound to the cover art to the song titles. For a long time, the only way to access that work on CD was a maroon box filled with 10 individual discs. It wasn't efficient, but it may have been the right way to appreciate it-- pulling out coherent, individual pieces, seeing the art, figuring out what each one had to say. Lullabies to Violaine is a lot more economical. It updates the span, running from 1982's Lullabies to 1996's Violaine (get it?), and it packages everything neatly on four discs to be sold in sets of two. (A limited-edition box of all four is also available.) The first set covers the band's years with 4AD, the ""arty"" London label whose aesthetic they did a great deal to define; the less-essential (but easy to like) second set covers their years with Mercury and Capitol. This means there is a whole career in here, as told in releases that always felt like miniature albums; for those who've skipped these, it's something like finding an alternate discography full of prime-era records. The first disc tells the best part of the story. When they started in the early 1980s, the Cocteau Twins were possibly a little strange: a vaguely gothic post-punk act with a drum machine, some oddly processed guitars, ambitious song titles, and a keening, fluttery, operatic (and totally unintelligible) singer. They were scrappy and shadowy, definitely gritty and definitely human. But fairly early on, they began to bring something very un-punk out of their music: They started filling their songs with nods at grand, classicist beauty, with sounds people couldn't help associating with baroque arts and pre-Raphaelite oil paintings. They began to sound like someone had sent a punk band on a time-traveling tour of European cathedrals-- and the punk band had somehow managed to live up to it, standing there and forcing out something fittingly gorgeous, something that actually kind of sounded like Caravaggio. Better yet, that atmosphere wasn't just cribbing from classical-music cues and baroque imagery: There was an incredible amount of sheer invention happening. On this first disc, post-punk takes flight: ""Feathers Oar Blades"" is a kind of new-wave dance unlike anything else, ""Sugar Hiccup"" launches into that swooning music for cathedrals, ""The Spangle Maker"" is both stirring and atmospheric. With the best tracks here, you can actually hear the effort in the songs: The band seems to be still standing in the post-punk basement, actually forcing something beautiful into existence down there between the cinder blocks. You can also hear them creating new sounds with each chronological EP. Elisabeth Fraser discovers her voice; along with Bjork, she's one of the best available arguments that acts like this can offer unusual vocal styles every bit as stirring and technically remarkable as any other genre. She learns how to multi-track her melodies into the interlocking hooks they'd later perfect; guitarist Robin Guthrie sorts out the grand wall of swooshing guitars (and effects) that would match them. Listening through these EPs on the same disc really does make the genuine b-level material stand out a bit more; pulling individual discs out of that maroon box, one tended to be distracted by the number of precious tracks. And fans will be disappointed to hear that the ""alternate versions"" of a few songs included here just sound wrong and ahistorical, even though that's how Guthrie wanted them in the first place. But there are plenty of precious things here-- more than most anything on your shelf. Disc two is the age of riches: Having broken through to a distinctive sound, the Cocteaus set about broadening it, cleaning it up, learning where it might lead. On Tiny Dynamine they learn how to float-- ""Pink Orange Red"" is a bigger, more awe-inspiring cathedral (and one of their absolute best tracks), and the remainder of the EP cruises along into the chilly, delicate comforts of the future. Echoes in a Shallow Bay is darker and more turbulent, bringing back a drum-machine stomp and that hard, keening lower register of Frasier's voice. (This is beauty that frightens-- something that winds through a lot of Cocteau work, and surely accounts for some of those old-religion metaphors.) And the very-solid Love's Easy Tears may sit at the dead center of the entire Cocteau ouvre. The part of their career that's missing is the one best represented by albums. As time went on, being beautiful wasn't even a strain anymore: If the Treasure LP has that taking-flight quality, then Blue Bell Knoll (the darker one) and Heaven or Las Vegas (the fluffier one) are just effortlessly dreamy. But eventually they began to seem a little too comfortable. The course of their career was like an airplane flight: There was the magic of watching them lift off the dirty runway and take wing, and there was the magic of breaking above the clouds and looking at a dreamworld, but after a while of coasting up there, the sun and clouds were just scenery. The funny thing about listening through discs three and four, though, is that the material doesn't feel as much like the slide it did at the time; some of it is even prettier, more confident, more consistent, and still awfully adventurous. The title track of 1993's Evangeline EP (also an album track) is a peak of spooky comfort, with a vibe something like Julee Cruise's Twin Peaks songs, and after that come rare, much-loved Cocteau versions of ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"". By the end of the disc we've reached what once felt like the Twins' back-looking period, with the acoustic versions of older tracks on Twinlights. They're terrific listening, and disc four kicks off with something that's anything but backward-- the stunning Otherness EP, on which the band took up the ambient-techno format people had always said their music had a kinship with. It's with Tishbite that the band begins to feel a little like a fluffed-up, tooth-extracted, or just point-repeating version of its former self. But that's something that-- when you're listening through a compilation, and not eagerly awaiting an album-- doesn't even seem so bad. That first volume-- the 4AD years-- still feels incredible: It's like watching geological action, where amidst a whole lot of dirty rumbling, brand-new awe-inspiring peaks burst up out of the earth. The second volume is like returning to those peaks and finding them fleshed out with trees and flowers and a visitors' station-- more inviting, but not so much where the action is. With either one, though, this is a spot its worth visiting. It's very easy to treat this band as an aberration or a cul-de-sac, a lone act with its own particular schtick. But don't forget that-- just as much as every band that pushed along a movement, inspired a whole genre, or did something else historically pivotal-- this act really created something.",,8.5,
Mother's Daughter...and Other Songs,Tunng,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bcc0084474cd0c0ec1/1:1/w_160/0448dbec.jpg,2006-03-28 06:01:48,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8317-mothers-daughterand-other-songs/,Static CaravanStatic Caravan,"""Folktronica"" is an unfortunate and probably outdated verbiage, but it's still apt for Tunng's debut album, Mother's Daughter...and Other Songs. The title and opening track begins with an unaccompanied female voice singing one note. Her voice is then inhumanly manipulated over stark percussion and a few staccato acoustic chords and, eventually, transformed into more traditional guitar-based folk with harmonies from Tunng's two main players, Mike Lindsay and Sam Genders. While I'm charmed by the reference to the discoverers of DNA in the love song ""Code Breakers"" and vaguely creeped out by The Wicker Man vibe in ""Fair Doreen"", the record continually falls into the same patterns-- straightforward folk with brief diversions, rustic samples or electronic percussion. ""People Folk"" is a more accessible Beta Band-like lurch, with sparse, pounding drums; ""Out the Window With the Widow"" is even more bare-- a few banjo plucks underneath Lomaxian echo, with electronic snaps and the hippie chanting of Lindsay and Genders. ""Beautiful and Light"" brings a more concrete melody plucked from acoustic guitar, along with a tender, memorable vocal line. A few far-off bell chimes tug the heartstrings a little harder, and the echo on the vocals and train engine samples add nostalgia while the skittering beat retains the urgency. It's impossible not to cite the Books after hearing this album's squishy, affectedly ancient percussion, not to mention the circular rhythm and vocal samples in ""Kinky Vans"". Artists like the Books-- or, say, the Junior Boys-- fully embrace dance/electric instead of merely spicing up their songs with a hint of otherness, and they don't flinch at leaving verse/chorus/verse behind. That's where Tunng falls short (or, in the case of ""People Folk"" or ""Kinky Vans"", just sound derivative). But am I reticent with praise because I need to put Tunng in a genre or a label? Or is it that Tunng aren't even trying to reach the bar they've set for themselves? Let's not knock simple folk songs, because Tunng have some great ones; ""Beautiful and Light"" even gains something from the production methods. But adding a few samples here and there doesn't deserve accolades in and of itself, and updating the time-worn with the cutting edge merits more than just a few pretty tracks.","Ace Fu issues the debut from this Beta Band-like group, which combines straightforward folk with rustic samples and electronic percussion.

Unlimited (1979-1983),Maximum Joy,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37eeb335119a49ed710/1:1/w_160/a53f82d5.gif,2006-03-28 06:01:47,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5682-unlimited-1979-1983/,Crippled Dick Hot Wax,"If you could use old music as fuel, we'd never have an energy crisis. Just when you thought they'd run out of great records to reissue from some genre or other-- post-punk, let's say-- out comes another mother lode from the vinyl mine and the collector's job gets even harder. If you bought all the reissues and kept up with all the mp3 blogs, you'd wind up with enough music in three just months to keep your ears packed until your great-great grandchildren shuffled off their genetically engineered mortal coils. But to the subject of post-punk's continued dividend payments: Maximum Joy were pretty special, and they deserve the resurrection treatment as much as anyone. Unlimited is a puzzlingly incomplete set-- it caps off at 56 minutes, while also dropping four tracks from the band's only LP, 1982's MXJY, which one imagines would have nicely filled out the rest of the disc. But while it's enough to make a completist wince in abject pain, the track listing is a pretty solid set of disco-dub-funk-jazz-punk (and you could tack a couple other syllables on that hyphenate, too). Maximum Joy were the brainchild of vocalist Janine Rainforth and Tony Wafter, who were later joined by ex-Pop Group members John Waddington and Dan Catsis. The music is reminiscent of the Pop Group's groundbreaking work but delivered in a more accessible vein, taming the nastier elements. Rainforth has a smooth, even alto that probably would have been singing British prog-folk 10 years earlier and trip-hop 10 years later. It even sounds pleasant when they run it backward at the end of ""White & Green Place"", though she does get in a couple of blood-curdling screams that scared the shit out of my cats on ""Stretch (99 Version)"". The latter track plays like it's made out of rubber, with scratchy guitars chicken-strutting over Kev Evans' funky bass part and nasty sax interjections. Tony Wrafter's arsenal of wind instruments gives the band a lot of its flavor-- he plays his sax and trumpet nice and smooth to complement the neo-hippie lyrics of ""Searching for a Feeling"", and he blows skronk all over the dub tracks. Maximum Joy prove to be a far less sarcastically named band than the Pop Group-- though they're far from sunny or optimistic, their music is stuffed with danceable grooves and bears a distinct lack of menace. It's not exactly pop; as melodic as it is, it's not usually very catchy, but it's bound to appeal to fans of post-punk's more jagged side. I can see fans of the Pop Group and early Shriekback (not in print at the moment, nudge, nudge) loving Maximum Joy, as they fall about halfway between those other two bands.

'Sno Angel Like You,Howe Gelb,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf06ea9e61561daa79c5/1:1/w_160/e7b6c532.jpg,2006-03-28 06:01:46,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3420-sno-angel-like-you/,Thrill Jockey,"While waiting to play a solo set at a blues festival in Ottawa three years ago, multi-instrumentalist Howe Gelb was caught by the arbitrary power of happenstance. Having unexpectedly found himself sandwiched between gospel groups at a Baptist church venue, Gelb watched as one choir after another performed, and the resonance of their rich, captivating voices wove through audience and into his blood. His inspiration to work with a choir came that day, and he returned to the church just in time to catch the final performance by Voices of Praise, the ensemble that eventually featured on 'Sno Angel Like You. The drive behind these recordings was to experiment with the juxtaposition between Gelb's experimental alt-country rambling and the warm, compositional synchronicity of a gospel choir. The result of this unlikely alliance is a delicately sparse collection of eight new songs that were sketched out specifically for the choir (who added their own vocal arrangements over the top), three re-workings of Gelb tracks written with his long-running group, Giant Sand, and three pieces written by the late Tucson guitarist Rainer Ptacek, a friend of Gelb's who died in 1997. Gelb's prowling, confident horse-trot rhythms entwine with Arcade Fire drummer Jeremy Gara's subtle beats, providing a new twist to Gelb's songwriting since the recent departure of Giant Sand's long-term rhythm section, Joey Burns and John Convertino (both of Calexico). Matched with the engaging beauty of the choral voices-- which sound like a completely natural part of the music, never gimmicky or superfluous-- this more skeletal rhythmic style allows Gelb to be freer with his compositions, and consequently these are some of the most memorable songs he has written. ""If you don't get the fuel, pray get the passion to keep the spirit rolling,"" Gelb sings on the opening track, ""Get to Leave"", which originally appeared on Giant Sand's 1989 Long Stem Rant. This kind of optimism permeates the feel of this record, backed up by the opulent, celebratory heave of the vocal lines. ""That's How Things Get Done"" is similarly a kick in the ass for positive thinking, though not, one feels, without Gelb's devilish smattering of irony. Despite his affection for sonic ""muck"", he holds back from wielding the sharp side of the blade too dangerously. The closest he gets is the snaky guitar solo freak out of ""The Voice Within"". Unlike Cat Power's The Greatest, also a melding of improbable genres and solo artists, Gelb sounds entirely comfortable in this musical environment, and with its subtly joyous tones and lustrous songwriting, 'Sno Angel Like You turns out to be a labor of love with endless rewards.","Giant Sand leader teams with gospel choir Voices of Praise on this delicately sparse album.

Ten Silver Drops,The Secret Machines,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a398b1335d7bf1698772/1:1/w_160/3373a131.gif,2006-03-28 06:01:44,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7059-ten-silver-drops/,Reprise,"The Secret Machines are never going to make it to ""The O.C."" Their candyprog blitz-- which combines Krautrock precision with U2-size melodies-- is better suited to a show like ""Battlestar Galactica"", with its Cylon battles and lost-in-space conspiracies, than to beach houses and young sunny romance. This is by no means a strike against the Texas trio: On the band's first full-length, they made cockpit music that was smarter and more confident than they got credit for, and those seemingly contradictory sonic elements-- the minutiae of the rhythms and the broad strokes of melody-- inflated each other to widescreen proportions, excusing the band's similarities to Pink Floyd and the Flaming Lips, while suggesting they had stumbled onto some new combination of these common influences. The Secret Machines' follow-up, Ten Silver Drops, is more earthbound than its predecessor-- the aftermath of the battle or the adrenaline crash. The band is less concerned with the previous album's veiled post-9/11 implications, which made Now Here sound like coded messages from a life-during-wartime underground. Instead, these eight songs (not 10-- we're two silver drops short) address everyday issues like romantic fallout, narcotic paranoia, and intraband relations. The first few sound the most invested: ""Alone, Jealous & Stoned"" is reportedly about the band members' simultaneous breakups with their respective others, as if the draw of the road has proved stronger than the pull of another human. ""All at Once (It's Not Important)"" explores this palpable pessimism even further, risking an emotional frankness that flirts with, but ultimately transcends, emo recrimination. ""Remember back when we first met, it don't mean much,"" Brandon Curtis sings. ""All those things you said you never meant."" Despite its thudding bombast-- it's both the heaviest and most agile song on the album-- ""Lightning Blue Eyes"" is tender where ""All at Once"" is cold, as Curtis tries to find some use for now useless memories. Together, those tracks form a strong stoner trilogy that derives its power from the songs' candor and contradictions. Plus, the subject matter brings out the best in the musicians, as they orchestrate these mood swings for maximum impact, sounding as big and as serious as ever-- even as they wallow in gloomy downheartedness. Unfortunately, these songs are immediately followed by ""Daddy's in the Doldrums"", the weakest track here, a plodding eight-minute riff on drugs that quotes a drumbeat straight from Now Here and features the band's silliest lyrics. ""I Hate Pretending"" continues in that same vein (no pun intended), upping the paranoia as Brandon Curtis describes a potential drug bust. But he hangs the hook on the line, ""There's an undercover cop parked right across the road,"" which seems too clunky and pedestrian to be anything but goofy in this context. The directness of these two songs is telling: There's not much to either of them, even as they play into the druggy clichés of the Machines' influences. Perhaps the album's critical flaw is that songwriting and sound seem less integrated. Brandon Curtis often sounds like he's singing over the music, not with it. The songs hew too closely to the lyrical structures, leaving the band no space to sprawl or, god forbid, jam. As a result, Ten Silver Drops settles into a midtempo sameness over its second half. ""Faded Lines"", with its chorus of filtered voices, ticks upward momentarily, an epilogue to that initial trilogy in quality as much as theme. After that, the album lingers for two more songs: The sonic wallpaper of ""I Want to Know"" wastes one of Ben Curtis's best guitar lines, while ""1,000 Seconds"" sounds cumbersome as it tries to make a final statement on romantic disappointment. By that point, the mood is ruined, the buzz hashed. Ten Silver Drops is an album in need of some plan of attack. Lacking the dynamic cohesion that made its predecessor more than the sum of its tracklist, it feels like merely a collection of random tracks, which, despite their common themes, begin to sound haphazard in their arrangements and sequencing. The problem isn't that they're grounded in real-life problems-- that might be the album's strongest draw. But just because the relationships have stalled doesn't mean the music should lose its forward momentum as well.","Available digitally in the U.S. and out Monday on CD in the UK, the latest from the Texas trio combines Krautrock precision with U2-size melodies.

"Raised By Wolves EP / Mothers, Sisters, Daughters & Wives EP",Voxtrot,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9abb1335d7bf1699514/1:1/w_160/996ffbf2.jpg,2006-03-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11861-raised-by-wolves-ep-mothers-sisters-daughters-wives-ep/,Cult Hero,"""[I]t's okay for somebody to be into both Throbbing Gristle and Belle and Sebastian,"" Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava writes on his blog, ""and I'm pretty sure that's a good thing."" When Srivastava moved to Glasgow at the age of 19, he'd already written the tracks that would comprise the Raised By Wolves EP, songs with deft arrangments and charming melodies that evoke Belle & Sebastian, Morrissey, and the Lucksmiths, but with jagged, rumbling guitars remindful of early Cure and, sometimes, Joy Division. Srivastava immersed himself in Glasgow's nightclub scene, developing a particularly strong affinity for Optimo. The commingling of his jangle-pop roots and his newfound love of dance music is writ large in the Texas-based band's turbocharged twee. Voxtrot's two EPs are so consistent and evenly matched that I'm going to address them as a single entity, although Raised By Wolves suffers slightly for having one tepid track, the late-Jawbreakerish ""Wrecking Force"". There's nothing terribly wrong with it; it's just not as spectacularly right as the other nine songs rounding out Voxtrot's recorded work. If there's any significant difference between the EPs, it's that Wolves is a little more obvious, with wafting respites like ""The Start of Something"" and ""Long Haul"" to blunt the serrated thrust that overtakes Mothers, Sisters, Daughters & Wives. This is probably why Wolves lept out as my initial favorite, until I'd listened to both EPs for long enough to internalize them and consider Mothers slightly stronger, if slightly more forbidding. Despite his jones for beats, Srivastava complies with twee tradition by allowing his singing and lyrics to assume center stage. His voice is forceful and tender in equal measure, dancing around central melodies with uncommon mobility and vigor. On ""Missing Pieces"", he moves effortlessly from a quivering falsetto to a soulful moan within the space of the word ""you""; ""Rise Up in the Dirt"" finds him equally comfortable at a croon and a near-shout. His lyrics strike a balance between open-hearted sentimentality and wry bemusment, leavened with artful obliquity and lexical music. If its melody weren't so exquisitely naïve, ""The Start of Something"" would collapse under lines like ""I'm a love letter away"" and ""If I die clutching your photograph/ Don't call me boring, it's just 'cause I like you."" But Srivastava seems to be at the mercy of his paramour to an almost unhealthy degree, and bitter acknowledgements of this dependency repeatedly deflate his whimsy: ""Everyone loves a man who lets the hardest people/ Build him up and cut him down to loveable size,"" he sings on ""Soft & Warm"". Voxtrot's music, though, is far more than a platform for Srivastava's vocal performances. The guitar work on both EPs, but particularly on Mothers, is a model of constrained energy, and the songs blossom with controlled detonations, like small charges set off sequentially to demolish a huge building. The complex arrangments never intrude upon the lucid melodic arcs; subtle string and brass sections are meted out judiciously. A twinkling piano phrase tiptoes around the careening guitars of ""Rise Up in the Dirt""; a fountain of chimes spills languidly over ""Long Haul"". And while Voxtrot's kinetic thrust may be the product Srivastava's inspiration, the rhythm section has to be credited for realizing it. Like the vocals, the basslines use melodies the way a gymnast uses parallel bars, their combination of mobile force and memorable sonority evoking the Dismemberment Plan's Eric Axelson. The percussion is crisp and compressed, so that each song displays lively patterns of overlapping movement within a tight sonic field. As is always the case with music like this, you'll come for the droll melodies. But whether it's the simmering drum and voice breakdown of ""Missing Pieces"" or the wedge of stately post-punk dropped convincingly into the middle of the otherwise fey ""The Start of Something"", you'll stay for the inspired songwriting choices and confident execution.",,7.8,
We Are Not the Infadels,The Infadels,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9adeb335119a49ec83d/1:1/w_160/89f7cff7.jpg,2006-03-27 06:01:53,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4169-we-are-not-the-infadels/,Wall of Sound,"I don't know which is a sadder stab at provocation-- adopting Osama Bin Laden rhetoric as your band name or adopting EMF as your go-to touchstone. Take your pick, but as the conflicting album title suggests, this British quartet certainly loves offering up gauche material and immediately negating it with the irony card. All the classic dance-rock trappings are here-- chameleon vocals, Cure shoutouts, klutzy synthesizers-- each glazed in glam-rock flair and Killers-grade pedigree. Problem is, Infadels practically grabbed the worst of all worlds. As songwriters, they resemble the Cure only rhythm-deep, and their rigid ditties lack the over-the-topness enjoyed by some of their more dramatic and committed peers. Thematically, the album reads pretty transparent. A quick glance at the tracklist reveals the intersecting threads of romance and modernity; frontman and John Malkovich clone Bnann opines over ""Love Like Semtex"" the ""Girl Who Speaks No Words"" when he's not bellyaching over ""Reality TV"" and ""Stories From the Bar"". However, all yammering aside, the Infadels still grate on a musical level. Carefree single ""Can't Get Enough"" practically boasts its own appeal, though Bnann's Brandon Flowers aping doesn't quite register as infectiously as he would like to think. Instrumentally, these guys are all over the place, updating anyone from Peter Gabriel to the Fall into a slickly produced mass of 80s kitsch. Unfortunately, too many basslines stall, too many synth melodies taper off, and too many drum beats grow stale right at the moment where a hook is needed. On ""Girl That Speaks No Words"", Bnann's sing-song verse flirts with catchiness only to abruptly hit the brakes before the track's anti-climactic chorus of ooh's and ah's. ""Murder That Sound"" hits a similar snag, investing heavily on its choppy Human League-style build only to plateau and retreat back into less-than-intriguing sci-fi ambience. While spotty hooks occasionally bail out the Infadels' creative palsy, the album's more proactive numbers only add insult to this injury. ""Reality TV"" barks more than bites, with Bnann sardonically tossing out Social Commentary 101 lyrics like ""the people on the screen are your family now"" and ""I wanna see people huggin' and kissin'."" Similarly, opener ""Love Like Semtex"" should come across as a call to arms, but instead it stumbles on a lifeless groove, a veritable dud for a song about explosives and sex. Track after track similar problems arise, and the album never lives up to its edgy/party surface. At the end of the night, the Infadels' promising shindig serves more sliced vegetables and Kool-Aid than pretzels and beer, and judging by the album's conservative creativity, the band's parents were invited, too.","Classic dance-rock trappings-- chameleon vocals, Cure shoutouts, klutzy synthesizers-- glazed in glam-rock flair and Killers-grade pedigree.

Tokyo,Guitar,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfceeb335119a49ed2a7/1:1/w_160/1ac3b021.jpg,2006-03-27 06:01:52,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3604-tokyo/,Onitor,"In theory, I love to hear traditional instruments and all their embedded associations mixing with the open-ended signifiers of electronic music. The guitar, so bound to Western popular music since the middle of the 20th century, seems particularly receptive to careful dissection by microprocessor. Many personal favorites from the past five years have come from someone trying to figure out novel ways to process an instrument and render the familiar new. As you might guess from the name German musician Michael Lückner gives to his project, he's a fan of the six-string. His first record with the name was 2001's Sunkissed, released, appropriately enough, on Morr. The album was a clear tribute to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, the guiding force for Lückner's experiments in sound manipulation. Following this well-received record, Lückner spent a good deal of time in Japan, and his 2004 Honeysky never made it out of that country. The inspiration for his third record comes from instruments he encountered there, particularly the guitar-like koto and pipa. They are indeed lovely-sounding instruments, and Lückner ably integrates their timbre into his sound. Problem is, there's not much going on beyond laying loops of various plucked phrases atop dully repetitive mid-tempo drum programming. Tracks throughout feel stiff and ridged; you can almost see the constituent parts of each being dragged and dropped into place and snapped into the grid. Very little processing is happening on ""Naoki"" and ""Red and White"", and the tunes are nice enough, but the lack of development and table-flat dynamic range makes for pleasant background music and nothing more. Vocalist and regular Lückner collaborator Ayako Akashiba joins on ""Tokyo Memory"" and contributes to most of the remaining tracks. Her style is prototypically Japanese indie, with its high, breathy coos, and it also sounds remarkably like one of the sisters in Múm. Two of the tracks with Akashiba hearken back to Guitar's shoegaze sound, with Lückner running his instruments through a chain of pedals (or some digital equivalent), and these are by far the most interesting. They work because they sound less careful and inhibited, without the fussy concern for every plucked string to be in its precise place. ""Sakura Coming"", with its throbbing sheets of sound underneath Akashiba's voice, sounds so much sloppier and less mannered than anything that comes before, with a weird mix and timings that don't quite line up. It's a flash of messy life on a record that too often feels half asleep.","German musician and former Morr artist Michael Lückner releases his second album since his move to Japan, and he's once again joined here by vocalist Ayako Akashiba.

Standing in the Way of Control,Gossip,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf81eb335119a49ed227/1:1/w_160/367d5551.jpg,2006-03-27 06:01:51,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3536-standing-in-the-way-of-control/,Kill Rock Stars,"It seems like yesterday that garage rock and dancepunk were all the rage. These days, those two genres' poster-boys have turned their backs on the sounds that made them. Jack White prefers creepy pencil-thin moustaches over ragged riffs and the Liars still dig drums, but definitely don't dance. The Washington-based trio the Gossip are still right there in the thick of it, straddling a fine line between the two. On its third album, Standing in the Way of Control, the band tampers with its formula, chucking ragged punk for a more streamlined dance-informed sound. New drummer Hannah Blilie (formerly of Seattle's Chromatics) delivers metronomic hi-hat hits and four-on-the-floor bass kicks, while guitarist Brace Paine plays the versatile one, turning in bouncing bass lines and hooks that range from thin and trebly to distortion-drenched. But the band's calling card is singer Beth Ditto's powerfully soulful voice, which registers somewhere between Ann Wilson wail and bloodcurdling riot grrrl cord-shredder. At times, her vocals sound completely at odds with the music: far too bluesy for such a cool dance machine. Then again, it's quite a distinction among a glut of post-punk revivalists. The album's heart is wrapped up in a three-song suite that kicks off with the uncharacteristically down-tempo ""Coal to Diamonds"". As Brace alternates between an ambling guitar line and rhythmic, but restrained down-strokes against Blilie's spare drums, it's Standing's first sign that the Gossip can let the motor idle. The space gives Ditto's enormous voice plenty of room to emote, as she sings of a failed romance, ""I thought about it 'til my head hurt."" ""Eyes Open"" builds on an insistent kick-drum thud and some caveman riffing that makes it clear that, even though they were raised in the South, they were weaned on Sabbath's version of the blues. And ""Yr Mangled Heart"" splits the difference between the two, as Brace's circular guitar and Blilie's crisp snare set a pace that repeatedly threatens to break into a full-fledged dance song. It's a kind of tease, in which the band continually reins itself and lets it all hang out in an ebb and flow of loud and quiet passages. While the tight playing and vocal pyrotechnics are impressive, Ditto's narrow lyrical scope gets really redundant. Most of the time, she comes off like a scrappy older sister who's fought at life's frontlines and lived-- just to deliver skin-saving insights like ""fight fire with fire,"" ""on the playground we learn so much,"" or ""you don't have to do this alone."" Unless you listen to records to buoy your self-esteem, this stuff plays puddle-deep. But that feel-good vibe brings the Gossip a little closer to disco's oblivious bliss. So who cares? Just shut up and dance, punks.","KRS band, always a treat live, hasn't tampered with its dated-for-freshness formula on this, its third album.

Collected,Massive Attack,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3cfea9e61561daa7fe6/1:1/w_160/54ac4114.jpg,2006-03-27 06:01:50,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5137-collected/,EMI,"The first time I flew from Syracuse to Baltimore, I was sure I was going to die. Shoehorned into one of those two-engine propeller planes, surrounded by screaming kids, snow starting to fall, warnings of turbulence crackling over the loudspeakers, nothing looked good. I slid on my Walkman and tried not to move until the whole thing was over, but then something amazing happened. ""Teardrop"" came on, a rainy, depressive drum track giving away to a breathtakingly gorgeous two-note harpsichord line, shivery guitar bits floating in, Liz Fraser cooing angelically, everything building slowly and gently into a blissful haze while I stared out the tiny porthole window at the sun setting over a frozen forest. All of a sudden, everything was going to be OK. Massive Attack's music brings back memories: not that crazy weekend you piled into a van and drove down to New Orleans for New Year's Eve, but those quiet and isolated instants, images that stuck in your mind for no reason, moments when your life started to feel like a movie. That's why Hollywood has been pillaging the group's catalogue for more than a decade, using its songs to score Sharon Stone humping a Baldwin in Sliver or Brad Pitt's mom's trailer burning in Snatch. ""Teardrop"" is Massive Attack's biggest-ever hit, the only time the group grazed the UK's top 10 singles chart, but more Americans know it as the theme to ""House"" than anything else. Massive Attack have never been anyone's idea of a singles act, and that's what makes the idea of a best-of album a bit dodgy. The group has only released four proper albums over the past 15 years: one absolute must-have masterpiece, two excellent long-players of languidly existential mood-music, and one total piece of shit. Collected is sequenced for flow, not for chronology, even though any 14 randomly-selected Massive Attack tracks would flow together just fine. This means that music from that piece of shit, the band's recent 100th Window, is more difficult to avoid; the anemic IDM drums and imitation-Kid A processed vocals of ""Butterfly Caught"" sound even worse when sandwiched between relative masterpieces like ""Protection"" and ""Unfinished Sympathy"". A bonus disc of rarities rescues the crushingly claustrophobic electro-dub Mos Def collaboration ""I Against I"" from the Blade 2 soundtrack, but it's mostly given over to gloppy, dismal background fare, making it difficult to understand why it's here at all. But a few inevitable stopovers in bullshit-land don't change the fact that Collected is a pretty incredible set of tracks; the group's fierce, creepy, paranoid fogscapes have aged better than the glassy boutique-music of any of their 90s trip-hop imitators. They've always fit better into the UK's Eno-PiL-Radiohead continuum of woozy pop experimentalists than into any loosely defined electronica scene anyway, and listening now, it's remarkable how they managed to combine so much disparate source-material into their expansively deep groove. The early masterpiece ""Five Man Army"" builds off the intricate, sidelong drum break from Al Green's ""I'm Glad You're Mine"", the same one Eric B & Rakim used for ""Mahogany"", layering on a relentlessly burbley bassline, an emaciated late-Specials guitar-skank, and a ghostly flute while Tricky, Daddy G, and 3D trade loose, free-associative rap verses and reggae vet Horace Andy's croon floats over the gaps. Other tracks add glistening pools of flanged-out postpunk guitars and lushly romantic strings and lonely jazz-saxophone flourishes. A small army of female guest-vocalists are featured (ethereal Fraser, soulfully robust Shara Nelson, wistfully precise Tracey Thorn), but the tracks never lose their dusty menace. The main disc ends with a new song, ""Live With Me"", an itchy, ringing, gorgeous slow burn with a broken, smoky vocal from Chicago folk-jazz legend Terry Callier, and it shows that the group may not have utterly died with the abject failure of 100th Window. Collected may not be a substitute for grabbing the group's essential records, but you'll be happy to have it the next time you end up on a two-engine propeller plane.","2xCD collection combines a disc of rarities with a disc of the band's best work, plus some songs from 100th Window.

Fishscale,Ghostface Killah,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff1ea9e61561daa7b33/1:1/w_160/12ba4c9e.jpg,2006-03-27 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/,Def Jam,"More than 12 years after he emoted all over the first verse on the first track on the first Wu-Tang Clan album, the now 35-year-old Ghostface Killah is still starving for respect, understanding, and acceptance. Hypnotically restless, the East Coast purist has homed in on a rap palette full of vivid hurt and strafing alarm-- and bursting forth with some of the most potent yarns, barbs, and production of his remarkably consistent career, Fishscale is the choice outcome of a creative mind using experience as a compass en route to triumph. Though Ghostface's veteran status informs much of his fifth solo album, his father-knows-best pose is led by breathless rhymes, not nostalgia. To wit, ""Whip You With a Strap"" rails against the lack of consequences brought upon today's youth with a smooth cleverness, while ""Big Girl"" moans about three fast-living women wasting their potential on cocaine mounds. Tellingly, it's Ghost's own coke the girls can't stop sniffing. Such ambiguities eschew didacticism for a lived-in wisdom that's as wicked as it is worthwhile. Ghost's godfather-cause is most noticeably directed at ostentatious modern-day rap hustlers who largely cook up tales with broad lines and no consequences, as he devotes several of Fishscale's 18 songs to the booming drug-rap subgenre he helped launch in 1995 with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... On both ""R.A.G.U."" and ""Kilo"", Rae turns up to assist his close friend, describing the perils of the drug trade. Hardly akin to the dealer-as-infallible-ghetto-champion guise currently purported by the likes of Young Jeezy, Fishscale's dope peddlers are harried and frayed. Between broken wrists, familial strife, and self-inflicted gunshots to the groin, ""R.A.G.U."" is anything but glorifying toward its stressed-out, drug-running protagonists. But the album's most vivid illicit spectacle belongs to Ghost alone; ""Shakey Dog"" takes the rapper's penchant for eye-popping lyrical imagery to its extreme, offering a twisty Mamet-style narrative about a botched two-man robbery attempt. ""Fasten your seatbelts,"" warns the Staten Island son before unraveling a scene so perfectly lucid that an accompanying video would be redundant. Whether describing the alluring smells coming from his victim's apartment or the ruthless history of an ancillary old lady (""She paid her dues when she smoked her brother-in-law at her boss' wedding"") he passes on his way up to the place, Ghost touches on myriad senses and memories-- it's the kind of song that requires several close listens to understand at all. It also strongly suggests that, if Ghost ever loses his appetite for rap, he might find success as a screenwriter. As the album's other specific tragedies-- shitty haircuts, bus stop infatuation gone awry-- fly by with deft everyman flourishes, it's the surreal ""Underwater"", with its strange spirituality, that proves most trenchant. The dreamy account finds our hero playing out a possible afterlife allegory while swimming at the bottom of the ocean. ""I'm not on my turf,"" he confesses as mermaids ""with Halle Berry haircuts"" offer guidance along the way. In the tourist role, Ghost is as compelling as when he's recounting pavement-bred stories of his familiar youth. Sometimes on ""Underwater"", the two come together brilliantly like when he notices ""SpongeBob in a Bentely coup, bangin' the Isleys."" Eventually arriving at the ""world's banginest mosque,"" Ghost finds comfort in Muslim chants; the rapper's rare moment of peace is well-deserved amidst Fishscale's enthralling agony. Aiding in the track's calming vibes is a mysterious, flute-laden beat courtesy of MF Doom, who's responsible for four beats on the record. The masked supervillain is in the company of a reputable bevy of soul-stacked sample-masters on Fishscale and their musical backdrops match Ghost's focus and vision. In an interview with RZA last year, he told me, ""Listen to how Ghost sounds rappin' over one of my beats and then over another beat... he sounds like a grown man [on my beat] and he sound younger on [other] producers' beats because they don't know the frequency."" But, as the first solo Ghost disc without a RZA production, Fishscale attests he was wrong. Whether it's the late Dilla providing his off-kilter vinyl-hiss haze for ""Strap"", Pete Rock cutting up Sly Stone's ""Family Affair"" on the hollow funk of posse cut ""Dogs of War"", or Just Blaze doing his Banger 101 thing on ""The Champ"" (which, stripped of its bootleg Rocky samples at the last minute thanks to copyright issues, still packs heat), each producer takes his opportunity to envelop today's most soulful rapper with deep swaths of vintage samples and deep drums. The RZA's sonic influence remains strong-- and he even shows up briefly on the excellent Wu reunion cut ""9 Milli Bros""-- but his absence behind the Fishscale boards is largely inconsequential. Considering Ghost's continued status as one of hip-hop's most revered, relevant elder statesmen, it seems odd that his name was seldom bandied about in most of the last decade's King of New York debates. Fishscale reiterates with cinematic verve that the most vital current Wu Tang Clan member's storytelling can match Biggie's in both excitement and humor. Yet Ghost's songs are unrelenting in their slavishness to density and credibility, and that can turn off casual listeners even as it intoxicates hip-hop purists. ""My arts is crafty darts, why y'all stuck with 'Laffy Taffy'?"" he asks with utter sincerity on ""The Champ"". As long as inevitable questions like that continually re-up this heavyweight's unswerving drive, they're probably better left unanswered. ","Bursting forth with some of the most pungent yarns, potent barbs, and peerless production of the Wu member's remarkably consistent career, Fishscale is the choice outcome of an endlessly creative mind using experience as a compass en route to triumph.

Traditional voices are pared down to sound bites. Organic musical systems harden into petrified tropes. Whole historical epochs resurface as hermetic genre exercises. Is there anything insidious about this flattened view of history? Are some historical moments still too emotionally raw and politically relevant to be casually appropriated, and where do we draw the line? Two Gallants beg these and other questions on their sophomore LP. What the Toll Tells appropriates Southern trad-Americana, from bitterly class-conscious folk to vibrantly violent outlaw country, and runs it through an emo-punk filter. The long compositions are modernized with the sort of croaky vocals and spiky guitars familiar from Bright Eyes and Cursive. The album opens with its strongest track, ""Las Cruces Jail"". Lonesome whistles set the scene for this yowling cow-punk stomper. Adam Stephens locates a strong vocal melody for his jailhouse lament, as he does on the acoustic dirge ""Steady Rollin'"". But the quixotic charm wears thin as ""Some Slender Rest"" dips into lugubrious emo-folk, and the remainder of the album's murdered wives, enraged sheriffs, and luckless roustabouts pile up cartoonishly. We've become anesthetized to morally murkier areas of rose-tinted Southern clichés, the same way that many of us can uneasily suspend judgment when listening to certain hip-hop music. But such rap is always, to some degree, responding to lived or shared experience. Two Gallants are borrowing otherness, which raises the stakes significantly. The nagging discomfort we're so good at ignoring when we listen to music that handles history like costume jewelry is thrown into stark relief by ""Long Summer Day"", a reworking of Moses ""Clear Water"" Platt's scathing work song (Platt's original is included on Deep River of Song: Black Texicans, which collects Alan Lomax's 1930s field-recordings of African-American music on the Texas frontier). I want to believe that Two Gallants had good intentions in covering this song. But intention is fleeting; if it ever becomes known to the public, it's quickly dispatched to the mists of time. Only the artifact remains. And this artifact scans to me as deeply insensitive and offensive. Spin.com brushed it off as an account of racism; occasional Pitchfork contributor Jonathan Zwickel hailed it as ""nothing short of revelatory"" in New Times. But what value is there in an account of racism from people who've never stared down its barrel? What could it possibly reveal? If these myopic responses reveal anything, it's that the topic is much easier to gloss over than to actually discuss. Such an inflammatory project needs a complex intellectual purpose to make it more than a cheap provocation. This rigor doesn't come through in the cover, and when a Drowned in Sound interviewer pressed Stephens on the topic of ""Long Summer Day"", he equivocated. ""I don't think it comes as something strategic,"" he said, and the interviewer demurred, because he was ""in no mood"" to really broach the topic. In the same interview, Two Gallants repeatedly complain about critics not ""getting them."" But a persistent failure of interpretation usually signals an initial failure of expression. The critic's job isn't to explore what an artist was trying to do, but what they've actually done. And this is it: A couple of white, twentysomething San Franciscans singing, ""the summer day makes a nigga feel crazy,"" a line destined to be belted out by carfulls of indie kids at the top of their ironic lungs. Is this healing? You decide.","Saddle Creek band appropriates Southern trad-Americana, from bitterly class-conscious folk to vibrantly violent outlaw country, and runs it through an emo-punk filter.

Box,Mellowdrone,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37d13d197565213bd3f/1:1/w_160/6d1083a5.jpg,2006-03-26 06:01:57,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5681-box/,ColumbiaRed Ink3 Entertainment,"Jonathan Bates loves the sound of his own voice. He wants you to love it, too; so much that he backs himself up and ad-libs on ""Four Leaf Clover"", creates a well of harmonies on ""Fashionably Uninvited"", and becomes a deranged doo-wop group on ""Madison"". You have to be comfortable with your voice to make a bedroom pop record, and Bates is the principal player and songwriter of Mellowdrone, who's been recording for years before releasing Box, his band's debut LP. Many one-man wonders have streamlined their quirks (Beck, Nine Inch Nails) or just disappeared by now (Self, anyone?), but Bates' smash-and-grab attitude towards genre finds a middle ground between indie and more radio-oriented modern rock, tossing small scraps to both camps. Box is a collection of sorts, borrowing four of the strongest songs from Mellowdrone's earlier EPs. The new tracks are just as bold: ""Oh My"" contrasts a perky strum and casual, slurred singing with aggressive beats and jagged guitars that would fit snugly on the latest Nine Inch Nails record, and ""Four Leaf Clover"" smears Twin Peaks synthesizers over looped acoustic guitars and lazy funk bass. Not every New-NIN, Depeche Mode-dabbler counts Angelo Badalamenti as an influence, and ""Fashionably Uninvited"", borrowed from an ealier EP, reaps the greatest returns. A little more ethereal and less blubbery then its older counterpart, the gentle bass-and-brushes opening beat imperceptibly slows time, while Bates' lilting vocals follow a tentative piano line that wades through like Fred Astaire pirouetting through the Walkmen's studio. Moments like that are enough to forgive-- indulge, even-- the swirling Alice In Chains-style vocals in the chorus. Elsewhere, the aggressive ranting/singing on ""Beautiful Day"" becomes even more paranoid with the open space of the recording. Bates' vocals have gone from impudent and angsty to a more confident croon; the big yell that comes later on ""Madison"" would make Julian Casablancas red with envy (as opposed to red from straining to hit notes). While the first half comes on strong with the sleek, aggressive would-be hits, the second shows their sensitive side: the coy seductive pulse ""Orange Marmalade"", the self-serving pep talk over suffocating bass on ""Madison"", the pleading of ""Bone Marrow"", or the baroque electronic death wish of ""Limb to Limb"". It adds depth and variety to Box, but it's also a struggle between identities-- Bates sounds like he wants it both ways, flipping the switch between introverted and invincible at will. Both are played with equal conviction, but it's the more wistful side of Mellowdrone that comes more naturally, and brings some ambiguity when those songs get the subtler, more seductive beats. Tracks like ""Oh My"" simply flash their goods. If it's the eager-to-please first half of Box that garners more fans for the band, I couldn't fault them for being as melodic and having a better sense of atmosphere than their alt-rock contemporaries.","After a series of EPs-- which supply some of the selections here-- Jonathan Bates issues the first proper LP from his part indie, part radio-oriented modern rock project.

In Colour,The Concretes,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6419d034d5c69bf34c1/1:1/w_160/72aae444.jpg,2006-03-26 06:01:55,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1573-in-colour/,Astralwerks,"Before listening to In Colour, I was sure I liked the Concretes. After listening to In Colour, I wasn't sure if I ever liked the Concretes. The album is noticeably different from their previous material: shambling rhythms are tightened, the Velvets-meets-Motown sway of their eponymous 2004 LP is replaced with an Elton-meets-Lilith piano-led pounce, and the band's former psych-tinged production now sounds as uncluttered as an empty apartment. The Swedish octet was always blatantly commune-ish-- organic tomatoes and homespun sweaters all the way-- but the free love was usually tempered by deep, vulnerable heartbreak that broke through such peaceful vibes. The band's best song to date, ""Say Something New"" from The Concretes, details the apparent awkward last words of a relationship; we never learn the exact utterance, but we know the crushed receiver wants to hear something-- anything-- else. On In Colour that kind of shrouded hurt is wiped away by lyrics that consistently reach inexcusable levels of banality along with a new sound concocted with the help of usually reliable Bright Eyes multi-tasker Mike Mogis that squeezes out the group's groove. What's left is toothless Sunday morning schmaltz. Bouncing forth with the permanent-smile major-chord plunks of opener ""On the Radio"", these troubadours flip their hand straight off. Streamlined to hell, it's still a technical wonder with the group's myriad voices finding a distinct home within the mix. But the collective effect is lessened, no matter how pristinely it floats from the speakers. Nico-esque lead singer Victoria Bergsman doesn't sound as enticing inside the pretty sonic paradise either, her naïve quivers neutralized and smoothed out. It's too much, too content, too polite-- and ""On the Radio"" is one of the better tracks on the record. Way worse is the queasy break-up duet featuring Concrete Lisa Milberg and lead Magic Number Romeo Stodart. ""I call, you hang up"" goes the hook between the two. The bogged-down instrumentation and simplistic sentiment somehow comes off like a screwed take on ""Puff the Magic Dragon"", which, although admittedly intriguing, is ultimately unlistenable. Meanwhile, another decrepit snail of a song, ""Tomorrow"", doesn't even last four minutes but-- with its echoes of Annie and an endless muted trumpet passage that stagnates like rotten garlic-- seems to drag on for hours. Almost everything that was unique and compelling about the Concretes-- including the faux-country sashay, the Diana Ross worship, and the willful wobble-- is pitifully underrepresented on In Colour. Before, it seemed like these beautiful free spirits were just cranking out great happy-sad songs, one of which happened to sneak into a Target commercial. Now it seems like they're trying to make music for a Target commercial.","Swedish band follows its slept-on eponymous record with an album on which its shambling rhythms are tightened and its Velvets-meets-Motown sway seems more Elton-meets-Lilith.

Show Your Bones,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab10c0084474cd0c12dd/1:1/w_160/46b1be18.jpg,2006-03-26 06:01:54,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8889-show-your-bones/,Interscope,"It's impossible not to hear the ghost of Fever to Tell on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' follow-up, Show Your Bones. With its 2003 full-length debut, the Brooklyn-based trio confidently staked out diverse territory-- from the meltdown-rock of ""Pin"" to the march of ""Black Tongue"" to the tenderly skewed balladry of ""Maps""-- and played those extremes against each other, so that each became even more extreme in contrast. The result was a complex sound that was simultaneously inviting and confrontational, and it made Fever to Tell this decade's gold standard for transcending indie hype. But while it makes sense for the YYYs to play off that earlier sound here, their new album sounds like only one side of a multifaceted band. For Bones, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recruited producer Squeak E. Clean, who fits these songs with an array of bells and whistles-- not to mention sirens, organs, programmed beats, acoustic guitars, rattling percussion, keyboards, and various studio effects. Most of it, unfortunately, simply seems unnecessary or excessive. In fact, more often than not, these sonic geegaws detract from the band's intensity, compartmentalizing the record's explosive moments from the songs themselves. Nick Zinner's guitar sounds smaller and less commanding here, and Karen O has toned down her presence considerably, rarely relying on the vocal tics that once seemed the equivalent of her famously ragtag glam fashion. Even when she unleashes that hellfire growl in ""Fancy"", it's buried so far in the mix that it's indistinguishable from the band's racket. Brian Chase's drum work remains confoundingly intricate, but seems strangely restrained nonetheless. The percussion should punish your eardrums when he pounds out the opening of ""Fancy""; instead it sounds polite, like he's clearing his throat to get your attention. When the Yeah Yeah Yeahs finally do cut loose at the frenzied end of the Strokes-fest ""Mysteries"", the moment has a get-it-all-out-now feel. These are growing pains for a band that has done a lot of maturing since Fever to Tell made them semistars. This newfound wisdom has its benefits, chief among them a confessional tone to the songwriting that effectively blurs the distinctions between Karen O and Karen Orzalek. Show Your Bones is a post-fame album, with many songs written from the specific perspective of a touring musician. ""Warrior"" begins as an acoustic ballad much like the previous album's ""Modern Romance"", but builds linearly to an intense finish as Karen O laments, ""Travel away, travel it all away/ The road's gonna end on me."" She never lapses into self-pity, though, mainly because the attraction of an excited audience proves as strong as the pull of a stable, homebound life. First single ""Gold Lion"" sounds like a mission statement: ""We'll build a fire in your eyes."" For its faults, howeveer, Show Your Bones contains some genuinely disarming moments that reveal the band's considerable emotional and sonic force. Despite its similarity to Love and Rockets' ""No New Tale to Tell"", ""Gold Lion"" unleashes a booming wordless chorus and a high-flying guitar riff from Zinner. On ""Way Out""-- perhaps the album's most effectively dramatic track-- O infuses her vocals with a palpable emotional fatigue, sounding desperate to reconnect with the world even as she slowly sinks into numbness: ""It's around me so tight!"" Still, on Show Your Bones the Yeah Yeah Yeahs occupy only one corner of the territory they claimed on Fever, walking confidently in their own footsteps but without claiming any new ground. If Fever had a skuzzy film of sweat and alcohol that sounded persuasively real, with songs that could have been cobbled together from scraps found in garbage bins and dumpsters, unmade beds and mess-strewn rooms, Bones possesses a too-clean sound and a songwriterly approach that seems more redolent of the studio than the stage. These refinements, which prove merely cosmetic, sap their sound of its brutal spontaneity and mute the band members' idiosyncrasies, and as a result, the album sounds guarded, with very little danger and too few moments of real urgency.","New York band follows its debut album Fever to Tell-- this decade's gold standard for transcending indie hype-- with a record that offers only one side of the group's multifaceted sound.

Reality Check,Juvenile,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c6b1335d7bf169833c/1:1/w_160/645bd662.jpg,2006-03-26 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4368-reality-check/,Atlantic,"In the movie Hustle & Flow, there's a moment where DJ Qualls, playing the goofy white beatmaker Shelby, describes Southern rap as the blues coming back home: ""From 'Back Door Man' to 'Back That Azz Up', it's all about one man's pain"" or some bullshit like that. It's a terrible scene, didactic and awkward. But it's interesting that he'd mention ""Back That Azz Up"", considering that Juvenile, the guy who made that track, has the bluesiest voice in rap (apologies to Trick Daddy): a weary singsong swamp-growl, all drawn-out half-swallowed vowels and rasping New Orleans Creole wavers. And now that acts of God and governmental neglect have effectively leveled Juvenile's hometown, that voice has a tragic context. Reality Check, Juvenile's seventh album, opens with ""Get Ya Hustle On"", a Hurricane Katrina diatribe as broken and confused as it is enraged. Over chilly harpsichord plinks and foghorn bass, he seesaws wildly between political invective (""Fuck Fox News; I don't listen to y'all ass/ Couldn't get a nigga off the roof when the storm passed"") and crack-dealer bluster (""Get ya mind right, nigga, get ya money up/ You're moving a little something, but you ain't done enough""). With this one track, Juvenile throws the past year's rampant trap-rap trend into shockingly sharp relief; how fatalistic must you be to advocate drug-dealing for post-hurricane recovery? Nothing else on Reality Check references Hurricane Katrina directly, but ""Get Ya Hustle On"" puts the rest of the album in a weird light. On ""Sets Go Up"", the album's best song, Juvenile snarls hometown pride over Scott Storch's masterfully spacey drums and synth-bleeps: ""New Orleans, see I'ma rep that cause these my peeps/ You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets."" But then, in Southern rap, it's not so much about what you say as how you say it, and so on ""Rodeo"", the bleakly guttural moans and gorgeously fragile Cool & Dre track resonate far more than the track's straight-ignorant strip-club lyrics. For all its fatalism, though, Reality Check is still a commercial Southern rap album, and it has certain obligations to fulfill as such, so it has a few songs about butts and cough syrup, and a small army of rappers making guest appearances and plenty of threats to kill you. On its own merits, it's pretty great. Many of the beats come from the relative unknown Sinista, whose muffled drum thumps, streaky organs, and prim synth-whistles give the album a bright, warm cohesion; this stuff is only going to sound better when summer arrives. Most of the guests acquit themselves well, especially Skip, a member of Juve's new U.T.P. clique who raps in an self-aggrandizing nasal bark, something like Dave Chappelle's Rick James voice. At more than an hour, the album is too long; it would be much better without a few of its second-half tracks, especially the garbage Brian McKnight collaboration ""Addicted"". Reality Check never quite transcends its genre, but Juvenile's resonant sadness always sets it apart. The album's closing track ""Say It to Me Now"" may be a dis against Juvenile's former fellow Hot Boy Lil Wayne, but it's more despondent than it is angry; not many beef songs end with anguished conversations with God.","NOLA emcee and original Cash Money member issues his first post-Katrina release.

Bloom EP,Fovea Hex,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929becd13d197565213b7bf/1:1/w_160/88123130.gif,2006-03-23 06:02:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3362-bloom-ep/,Die StadtJanet,"In the early 1970s, Irish singer/songwriter Clodagh Simonds was a founding member of the progressive-folk cult favorites Mellow Candle, and later went on to perform with Thin Lizzy and Mike Oldham. As with many of her folk-rock contemporaries, Simonds has been long absent from the recording scene but has seen a recent surge of interest in her earlier work, as exemplified by Stephen Malkmus' 2003 cover of Mellow Candle's ""Poet & the Witch"". Intriguing though it's been, however, there's nothing in Simonds' past history that could've adequately foretold the remarkable appearance of her new project, Fovea Hex. Featuring contributions from such heavyweights as Brian and Roger Eno, the Hafler Trio's Andrew McKenzie, and film composer Carter Burwell, Fovea Hex represents a startling confluence of talents and styles, and the group's first release is uniquely possessed of an icy, sapphire-like radiance. This three-song EP is the first installment of a proposed trilogy entitled Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent and brief though it is, the record exhibits a sterling assortment of ambient, high-density drones, all of which are subtly bound by Simonds' songcraft and crystalline, folk-derived vocals. Assembled and mixed by McKenzie via a ghostly construction of harmonium, viola, zither, and ""disappeared piano,"" the deceptively active arrangements achieve a frosty mood somewhere relative to Nico's The Marble Index, Current 93's apocalyptic folk-drones, and the unflinching winterscapes of Burwell's Fargo soundtrack. But despite Fovea Hex's assembled instrumental firepower, Simonds unquestionably emerges as the central figure on these performances-- particularly on the near-acappella opening track ""Don't These Windows Open"". Conducted by McKenzie's invisible hand, here Simonds' multi-tracked chorale is as gracefully split and clarified as sunlight mirrored off the polar icecaps. Yet though all appears tranquil on the surface, on Bloom there are unseen forces at constant work to undercut Simonds' lyrics with ripples of doubt and anxiety. ""Cry for your father/ Don't these windows open?/ How could he hear us?"" she fervently sings on this first track, sounding determined not to lose her cool in a crisis. Later on, amid the gorgeous dunes of ""We Sleep You Bloom"", she again conjures indistinct external spirits, ""Way down beneath the battlefield/ Down there beside the fire...as we sleep you bloom,"" leaving ambiguous the nature of these unnamed forces that ""bloom in a petrol rainbow dark."" And throughout these performances, Simonds tempers her passions with an elegant measure of stoic restraint, aided by the exceptional vocal harmonies of Brian Eno, Laura Sheeran, and Lydia Sasse. So potent, in fact, are Fovea Hex's joint creations that the album's brevity becomes its primary drawback. Simonds has a voice that one could happily drown in for hours, and obviously guys like McKenzie, Burwell, and the Enos would benefit from further opportunity to stretch their collaborative limits. So it's good news to learn that the next chapter in the Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent series is due later this spring, and a minor impatience to anticipate the day when the entire work is available to be absorbed as a whole.","This three-song EP features contributions from Brian and Roger Eno, the Hafler Trio's Andrew McKenzie, and film composer Carter Burwell (Being John Malkovich, The Big Lebowski).

Omni,Acid Casuals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ddea9e61561daa48d8/1:1/w_160/9b03a251.gif,2006-03-23 06:02:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/502-omni/,Placid Casual,"Electronic side projects, like import-price-paying fanboys, suffer. Even the occasional breakout commercial successes-- Folk Implosion, the Postal Service-- never quite earn the critical props proffered to their progenitors. Maybe the neophilic indie kids cultivating a taste for electronic crossovers can't win friends with records linked to veteran guitar acts (nor, sadly, with salad). Acid Casuals may count Super Furry Animals keyboardist Cian Ciárán among their members, but Omni shouldn't be consigned to the synth-based novelty scrapheap alongside, say, the Album Leaf or 1997 Claptronica excursion TDF. While Omni could be seen as merely SFA's ""lost"" techno album, its ambient, melodic near-instrumentals deserve to succeed on their own merits. Each track's songy enough to leapfrog Isolée and layered enough for bobbins, analogue-bent entirety conjuring what Analord might've been. The languid Dennis Wilson pacing from Ciárán's Love Kraft contributions washes over the electronic weirdness found in Guerilla-era tracks like ""Some Things Comes From Nothing"". Gorgeous lead single ""Bowl Me Over"" is Omni's only conventional pop song, cooing doo-wop romance like a stoned sentimentalist's take on ""Something 4 the Weekend""-- still SFA's most immediate tune. The album's other tracks rely mostly on nonsense vocals, such as the jazzy, Cornelius-kooky ""Wa Da Da"", harmony-drenched ""Y Ferch Ar Y Cei Yn Rio"", or waltzing ""Kraken"", which features an operatic female voice that explains Ciárán's choice of Bizet's ""Pearl Fishers"" for last year's Under the Influence compilation. Chiming, slightly dissonant opener ""If I'm a Selt, You're a Sunt"" tags near Caribou territory, while penultimate ""Luciano"" licks high-pitched synth tones from Mwng's ""'Dacw Hi"" before lounging in hot-Air orchestration. So call it one small blip for SFA, one enormously satisfying listen for 2006. Like Gruff Rhys on his 2005 solo album Yr Atal Genhedlaeth or, hopefully, Dafydd Ieuan's bilingual rock group the Peth, Ciárán and co-Casual Kev Tame (former bassist for Welsh-language pop group Big Leaves) have created a side project work that would stand as a career highlight for many of their peers. If you're one of those neophilic indie kids, just pretend they're German twentysomethings.","Debut album from an electronic multimedia collective led by Super Furry Animals keyboardist Cian Ciárán.

Notes and the Like,Ms. John Soda,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fc5e6ef95969323962/1:1/w_160/f28d0b60.gif,2006-03-23 06:02:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5487-notes-and-the-like/,Morr,"Ms. John Soda's 2002 No P. or D. was one of the few lap-pop records that wasn't straight-up teflon. Talk about a genre that produces a lot of unmemorable drivel: From the last few years, its standout records are either not really lap-pop (Octet's Cali-pop-smitten Cash and Carry Songs) or just exceptionally bad (Styrofoam's Linkin Park-smitten Nothing's Lost). But No P. or D. was different. It had happy hooks and melancholy hooks and lush quasi-acoustic instrumentation, and it sounded just as good on a sunny day as on a rainy reflective one. The German duo of Stephanie Böhm and Micha Acher (the Notwist) substituted layered melodies for stacks of blippy folderol, creating a record free of the superfluous electronic baggage and nonessential sounds this stuff often swims in. Four years on, Ms. John Soda haven't gone less digital, even if the novelty of having a glitch-ridden beat behind a pop hook has simmered down a bit. ""A Nod on Hold"" coruscates with textural arpeggios, which were cool before the Postal Service abused them like chow mein does cornstarch. The song wouldn't necessarily be better or worse without such a commonplace, but its predominance in the mix suggests a few things: (1) Lack of confidence. How can anyone think one-touch chattering-machine FX are still a good idea unless trying to dress an anorexic song? The track isn't even that bad, just a little depressive, and the padding is unnecessary. (2) Growing disenchantment. ""A Nod on Hold"" is what I call the rise-and-shine lullaby. Standard fare for many lap-pop records, these gauzy overtures carry an air of foreboding, which makes them ideal as introductions. But they also serve as tranquilizers, drawing listeners into a dreamy, incubated headspace. ""A Nod on Hold"" is too tremulous to occupy this role; it leans on quavery strings where it needs a sure-footed hook. (3) A duo running low on ideas. The track would've probably missed the cut for No P. or D., a scant eight-song package whose weakest cuts were much fleshier than this; on Notes and the Like it's the opening track. Looking a little sallow this time out, Ms. John Soda can ill-afford to wax so melancholic. ""A Million Times"" calls back the quavery strings, this time pushed further up in the mix against a milquetoast beat. Only Böhm's wispy, serene vocal redeems the thing from total flaccidity-- she sounds sad, but at peace. At times she seems to want to quit singing entirely, content to run off motorik verses in a blindfolded monotone. On ""Scan the Ways"", the album's best song, this works; over driving guitar-and-bass eighths speckled with nice-enough flourishes-- flute flits and harpsichord-sounding incandescences-- her drone is more urbane than mundane. It's no surprise her style works best when she's resigned, as opposed to downtrodden. But in lieu of No P. or D.'s deep textures, we're left with the blippy folderol. Notes and the Like is par-for-the-course lap-pop, and that could well be the point. But as someone who has long understood lap-pop to be the Switzerland of genres-- a neutral aesthetic baseplane artists must activate with things like melody and surprises-- I find that hard to understand and even harder to believe.","German lap-pop group follows its excellent 2002 album No P. or D. with this melancholic release.

My Life in the Bush of Ghosts,David ByrneBrian Eno,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a421ea9e61561daa4e23/1:1/w_160/0b7d0b88.jpg,2006-03-23 06:01:59,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/,SireSire,"As David Byrne describes in his liner notes, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts placed its bets on serendipity: ""It is assumed that I write lyrics (and the accompanying music) for songs because I have something I need to 'express.',"" he writes. ""I find that more often, on the contrary, it is the music and the lyric that trigger the emotion within me rather than the other way around."" Maybe because it's so obviously the product of trial-and-error experimentation, Bush of Ghosts sounded like a quirky side project on its release in 1981; heck, it didn't even have any ""songs."" But today, Nonesuch has repackaged it as a near-masterpiece, a milestone of sampled music, and a peace summit in the continual West-meets-rest struggle. So we're supposed to see Bush of Ghosts as a tick on the timeline of important transgressive records. It mostly holds up to that scrutiny. An album that's built on serendipity-- on Brian Eno fooling around with a new type of drum machine, on syncing the hook in a tape loop to a chorus, on finding the right horrors on the radio-- can't score 100%. But even if you cut it some slack, crucial parts of the album don't sound as intriguing today as they once did-- namely, all of the voices. The sampled speech from various, mainly religious, sources ties the album into a long and prestigious history of artists who used found sound, which David Toop capably outlines in the liner notes. It's still the secret sauce that provokes a reaction from the listener. But what reaction you have lies outside of Byrne's, Eno's, or your control. On the first half, where the voices are least chopped up, it's difficult to divorce them from their origins. A couple of tracks read as satire-- ""America Is Waiting"" sounds like Negativland with a way better rhythm section-- and others as kitsch. ""Help Me Somebody"" pulls a neat trick by turning a preacher into an r&b; singer, but the exorcist on ""The Jezebel Spirit"" doesn't raise as many hairs on the back of my neck now that taping a crazy evangelist has become the art music equivalent of broadcasting crank phone calls. We can't just hear them for their sound or cadences without digging into the meanings, and not everyone will find the meanings profound. On the other hand, the rhythm tracks still kick ass 10 ways to Sunday, thanks both to the fly-by apperances of Bill Laswell, Chris Frantz, Prairie Prince, and a half dozen others, and to the inspired messing about of Eno and Byrne as they turned boxes and food tins into percussion. Tape loops are funkier than laptops, and the modern ear is so aware of the digital ""noodging"" of a sample to a beat that the refreshingly knocked-together arrangements of Bush of Ghosts are a vast improvement. At one stage of the project, they dreamed about documenting the music of a fake foreign culture. They largely pulled it off, and you can tell a lot about this far-off place from its music: It's a futuristic yet tribal town made of resonant sheets of metal and amplified plastic containers, that the populace has to bang constantly in perfect time to make the traffic move, and the stoves heat up, and the lights flicker on at night, and to coax mismatched couples into making love and breeding new percussionists. The seven bonus tracks will provoke more arguments than they settle. The setlist of Bush of Ghosts has changed several times over the years, and the diehard fans will still have to swap left-out cuts that aren't resurrected here; most famously, ""Qu'ran"", an apparently sacreligious recording of Koran verses set to music, doesn't get anywhere near this reissue. The songs that are here include a few that sound almost finished, including ""Pitch to Voltage"", and others that would fit almost as well as anything in the second half of the disc. The last cut, ""Solo Guitar with Tin Foil"", features someone, presumably Byrne, playing a haunting tune on a guitar with an impossibly clean tone-- a fitting end to an album that, for all its transcontinental fingerprints, sounds strikingly free of impurities. Though Bush of Ghosts was a link in the chain between Steve Reich and the Bomb Squad, I'm not convinced that this talking point helps us enjoy the album. However, Nonesuch made an interesting move that could help Bush of Ghosts make history all over again: they launched a ""remix"" website, at www.bush-of-ghosts.com, where any of us can download multitracked versions of two songs, load them up in the editor of our choice, and under a Creative Commons license, do whatever we want with them. As I write this, the site hasn't launched, and even if it were up, I can't tell how lively its community will be, how edgy the remixers can get, and how many rules will pen them in. Nonesuch copped out by posting only part of the album, instead of every piece of tape they owned, and I suspect that the bush-of-ghosts.com site may just be a corporate sandbox for wannabe remixers. But I could be wrong; I haven't tried to submit my mash-up of ""Qu'ran"" and Denmark's National Anthem yet. What matters is that they started the site and released these tracks, and by doing so, they put a stake in the ground-- not the first one, but an important one-- for Creative Commons licensing, Web 2.0 album releases (""this is an album where you participate!""), and the culture of remixing. And by handing over their multitracks, Byrne and Eno also make a powerful acknowledgement of their own helplessness. It is a basic but real fact of our time that sampling can work both ways. In the 80s, you could fairly make an argument that Byrne and Eno were the Western white men appropriating all kinds of Others, be they domestic and primitive, or foreign and exotic. Now the world can return the favor: Anyone can rip this work apart and use it any way they please, and you can bet that if some kid in the Third World sends a killer remix to the right blogger, it'll travel faster and farther than this carefully curated reissue. Byrne and Eno counted on a certain amount of serendipity in their studio; today, they can witness the serendipity of what happens to their killer rhythm tracks-- the ones they released, and all the others that people will use anyway. And the strongest message they could send is not only that they've relinquished control, but that they admit they already lost it-- whether they like it or not.","Nonesuch offers an expanded reissue of this 1981 near-masterpiece, a record that's both a milestone of sampled music and a peace summit in the continual West-meets-rest struggle.

Judee Sill / Heart Food,Judee Sill,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d413d1975652139288/1:1/w_160/7f2f83a4.jpg,2006-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11844-judee-sill-heart-food/,AsylumAsylum,"When I think about ""teenage symphonies to God,"" I'm usually unmoved. Despite Brian Wilson's audacious-- even in an era remembered for its spiritual ambitions (and hang-ups)-- claim for Pet Sounds, his phrase has gone the way of most sound bites: It's become clichéd and almost meaningless. Yet, the music is hardly affected by this claim. If anything, it overshadows it; songs like ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"" and ""God Only Knows"" seem so far beyond the realm of ""teenage,"" I wonder if others who might have wanted to make sure Wilson's band always had a place on the radio influenced his characterization of his own stuff. In any case, he only sporadically approached the divine thereafter. In fact, few pop artists of any stripe have come as close to writing modern day hymns like Wilson's in the mid-1960s. Judee Sill was a California girl. Like Wilson, she had a troubled family; the tragic death of her father while she was still a child, and the death of her brother soon afterward left her permanently scarred-- and her mother's alcoholism left Sill practically rootless. Rootless, that is, except for an almost feverish mystic-religious bent, inspiring the likewise artistically minded Sill to write several songs directly related to Christ-like figures or otherwise heavenly phenomena. After surviving a heroin addiction and a brief stint as a bank robber, Sill turned her rather intense passions to music. In the late-60s, after having been introduced to a fertile L.A. songwriter community by her then-husband (and future record producer) Bob Harris, she began writing songs for other acts, including penning the Turtles' single ""Lady O"". After up-and-coming record mogul David Geffen spotted her playing sets at various Hollywood clubs, he offered her a publishing deal, and eventually signed her to his own newly formed Asylum Records. Sill's music was complex, elegantly crafted and yet completely devoid of pretension or overwrought melodrama. Often accompanying her clear, unmannered voice with just her acoustic guitar, Sill made music that seemed more suited to a small chapel than onstage at a club. Unfairly lumped in with other female, proto-adult contemporary songwriters like Joni Mitchell or Carole King, Sill was much closer in spirit to Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, or one her idols, J.S. Bach. She had a gift for making very complicated things sound simple, beautiful. Often, her arrangements took advantage of a chamber orchestra or layers of vocal harmonies, and rather than seeming pumped full of grandeur, they were tiny miracles of poetic efficiency. Her modest Southern drawl-- an affectation shared by many of her SoCal contemporaries-- is the only thing that dates her songs at all, and Water's reissue of her first two LPs (coming a year after Rhino's limited reissues) should find Sill ready acceptance by almost anyone into gentle, heart-lifting music. 1971's Judee Sill begins unobtrusively with Sill's buoyant, finger-picked guitar and her declaration that ""nothing's happened, but I think it will soon/ So I sit here waiting for God and a train to the Astral plane."" She was very fond of mystic imagery (not to mention astrology), but the simple beauty of her music tended to keep the songs from floating off into the ether. She further evokes the supernatural in ""Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos"", ""The Lamb Ran Away With the Crown"", and the gospel-tinged ""Enchanted Sky Machines"", though the only song to actually namecheck a religious figure is curiously enough not a religious song at all. ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" was the hit that should have been. Produced by Graham Nash, and featuring one of Sill's best lyrics-- detailing her betrayal by a former partner (in fact, fellow L.A. songwriter J.D. Souther), and using the song's title as an indication that even the people we loved the most had the ability to let us down-- the song begins as understated piano ballad. The chord progressions would have made Wilson smile, and when the chorus hits-- female chorus of background harmonies and full band lifting things off the ground-- I'm hard pressed to think of a more uplifting piece of music. And then I heard ""The Kiss"" from 1973's Heart Food. If ever there was a song that lived up to the glorious, simultaneous heartbreaking and mending I might expect from a symphony to God, it's this. Sill once again plays piano (and in fact did all the orchestral and vocal arrangements herself), using another unbelievably gorgeous chord progression, taking advantage of pedal notes and resolving cadences in much the same way as Bach did, and uses her lone, double-tracked vocal to deliver a melody that arrests me no matter how many times I hear it. A sampling of Sill's words-- ""Promise me this and only this/ Holy breath touching me/ Like a wind song / Sweet communion of a kiss""-- reveal someone obviously enamored of the beyond, of the archetypical bridegroom who was at once the songwriter's savior and father, and abandoned husband. I might add that I'm not religious in the slightest, but think it would take an almost total lack of sprit not to be moved by this stuff. Though it would be tough to top something like ""The Kiss"", the remainder of Heart Food is almost as good. Tracks like the up-tempo ""Soldier of a Heart"" (another hit that never was) or ""The Pearl"" demonstrate Sill's seeming proximity to people like Linda Rondstadt, though she could hardly have fit less comfortably into the pop-star's mold-- in fact, she refused to play live if forced to open for other acts, which meant she basically stopped playing live altogether. No matter, as her multi-layered, album-ending opus ""The Donor"" indicates, Sill shone plenty brightly in the studio. The comparatively epic-length of the track (just over eight minutes) is filled to the brim with vocal harmonies, including male voices in the distance, and a cyclical chord sequence shimmering via piano, bells and timpani. If you listen close, you can hear the voices chanting in Latin, and when they commiserate in unison at ""kyrie eleison,"" I'm again stopped dead in my tracks. Sill never released anything else. She'd begun recording another record (the unfortunately underwhelming results of which have been released on a 2xCD compilation Dreams Come True), but by the mid-70s had resumed her heroin habit and dropped almost completely off the music landscape. She died of an overdose in 1979 and such was the degree of her professional disappearance, it's rumored that it took a year for the news to filter to her onetime patron Geffen. Nevertheless, her gifts survived. As with the music of Wilson or Bach, it's hard to suppress the inner light of Sill's work. It shines.",,8.7,
Cost,Patrick Phelan,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a052c0084474cd0bfb42/1:1/w_160/80f9ef3d.jpg,2006-03-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6262-cost/,Jagjaguwar,"The tenets of pop and post-rock are about as far apart as possible. The former channels its energy through concrete structural cells to produce a sort of lucid pleasure; the latter-- although now ossified enough for its maneuvers to be as familiar as pop-- deranges this linear passage with a variety of skew-angled, semi-permeable membranes to produce cognitive dissonance. Pop songwriting often emphasizes singing as an aesthetic center; post-rock is often instrumental, or burdened with vocals so monochromatic and faceless as to be inconsequential. Pop is warm, utopian, and emotional; post-rock is cold, dystopian, and cerebral. Despite these tensions, Patrick Phelan's third LP manages to believably reconcile the two genres. With its dirge-heavy and lugubrious shimmer, Cost's slinky post-rock is, in part, completely textbook. The album opens with the instrumental ""In Words"", where great slabs of bass plot vertices on an expansive graph of quivering ambiance; its sloughs and peaks are pretty but don't distinguish Phelan from the post-rock pack. The same holds true for all of the instrumentals, which are usually fairly brief interludes: ""In View"" lets its delicate scraps of acoustic guitar drift through a gusty tunnel, and ""We Forgive Our Own"" barely hints at structure with a smattering of percussive plinks. But ""Favor"", one of the non-instrumental songs that comprise the bulk of the album, does distinguish Phelan from other rock bands who've added laptops to their live arsenal: Its fleet bassline, insistent percussion, and crystalline guitar unfurl in orderly rank and file, intermittently gussied up with a rock crunch that amplifies the song's forward momentum. Phelan gives no quarter to superfluous vocals or disorganized arrangements. He lays out his quietly dissonant melodies in transparent, sequential lines, and his vocals-- stoically emotive and unapologetically human-- become the centerpiece of any song they inhabit. Phelan's voice scuds across the slate-grey sky of ""Ruin"" like a thundercloud, overshadowing the spare track instead of blurring into it. As ""Settlements"" see-saws between electro-acoustic atmosphere and pyrotechnic sparks, it evokes a Brit-pop Mogwai; the sinuous and chiming torch song ""Sails Descending"" sounds like Elliot Smith singing for Bark Psychosis. Elegant and understated but not obtusely obscure, Cost locates the humanity in a genre that tacitly seems more interested in apocalyptic wastelands and extreme post-human futures.","Jagjaguwar artist's third LP manages to reconcile the tensions between pop and post-punk.

The Tango Saloon,The Tango Saloon,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b9ea9e61561daa58bb/1:1/w_160/2cc416f8.jpg,2006-03-22 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8315-the-tango-saloon/,Ipecac,"Call it Libertango. The title of Astor Piazzolla's classic piece of nouveau tango fits nicely as a descriptor of the Tango Saloon's music-- they even cover the song on this, their debut album. Tango Saloon mastermind Julian Curwin has clearly spent time soaking in Piazzolla's intoxicating creations, and he uses them as his starting point, drawing in electronic elements as well as snatches of free and cool jazz and soundtracks. His press claims that the ""Saloon"" portion of the name comes from the music's affinity for Ennio Morricone, but I hear just as much Lalo Schifrin and Jerry Goldsmith in there, and the Western aspect of the music is frankly pretty played down. Curwin plays guitar among other things, and he's ably backed by a cast of musicians who seem to understand the tango foundation of the music, but aren't so tied to a sense of tradition that they're afraid to take it in new directions. Violinist Shenton Gregory and double bassist Kory Horwood both play a big role in shaping the album's sound and Gregory especially gives it a shot of romanticism, but it's accordionist Svetlana Bunic who does the most outside of Curwin to give the album its shape. She even wrote ""Upon a Time"", one of the record's best compositions, a dramatic, high-speed tango that alternates between prickly oompah passages Danny Elfman would kill for and more contemplative front parlor passages filled with soaring violin and musette accordion. Curwin's own ""March of the Big Shoe"" injects some Pink Panther sax to the mix, ripping along over a chugging lower-register piano rhythm, while Sam Golding plays trumpet, flugelhorn, and tuba on the gibbering, surreal horn arrangement that tops ""The Little Plane That Could"". His horns are cast adrift in a fog of vibes, setting a fever drift carnival atmosphere. By far the most outré and challenging piece of music on the album, though, is ""Man with the Bongos"", eight minutes of bongo fury underscored by a squelching bass synth that sound like amplified stomach grumblings. The horns, initially so together, wind up soloing all over the place, squabbling with the accordion and violin in a free jazz-inspired melee, and the piece detours into a mariachi surf thing before heading off into abstract funk. In crafting a tribute to Piazzolla, Curwin nicely captures the searching, fearless spirit of his hero and comes up with a lot of cool, unique music in the process. It's not going to replace Tango: Zero Hour on my stereo, but it'll serve as a nice companion anyway. The album's chief failings are small, usually amounting to a poorly chosen organ sound (as on ""Formaggio"") or owing to a sense of structure that can get overly lackadaisical. Overall, though, it's satisfyingly weird, and you're not likely to hear anything else like it any time soon.","Julian Curwin's project uses Astor Piazzolla's intoxicating creations as a starting point, drawing in electronic elements as well as snatches of free jazz, cool jazz, and soundtrack music.

Ignatz,Ignatz,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9abea9e61561daa7034/1:1/w_160/cfe98015.jpeg,2006-03-22 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4168-ignatz/,K-RAA-KK-RAA-K,"The critic Roselee Goldberg credited the violinist Henry Flynt with taking the fascism out of bluegrass. Flynt's own self-appraisal was no less grandiose, once claiming that he ""did for hillbilly music what Ornette Coleman did for jazz."" These were grand conceits for a man who ceased making music more than 20 years ago, and whose total recorded output had been until recently consigned to oblivion. But time has a way of transmuting self-mythology into canon, and recent years have seen Flynt's reputation loom ever larger. The last five years have witnessed the unearthing of a substantial and often stunning catalog of Flynt recordings by labels like Locust and Recorded. These works document the road not taken by the majority of Flynt's early minimalism cohort, many of whom abandoned Western music for the sacred east under the authoritarian tutelage of Pandit Pran Nath. Flynt on the other hand played the prodigal son, returning to the native musical soil of his Carolina boyhood. In doing so, Flynt prospected the vast rocky territory of a new American primitivism, mining veins in which the antiquarian and the avant-garde were reconciled. Flynt's vision of a ""new American ethnic music"" has surely found its avatar in the great awakening of American free music currently underway. Ensembles like Pelt and Jackie-O Motherfucker have offered up grave séances of the American musical past, in which old voices have been conjured to speak new words. Meanwhile the late John Fahey's monumental Revenant label continues to diagnose a common American savagery in artists as diverse as Charlie Feathers and Albert Ayler. We should not be surprised at this minor renaissance afoot. Americans are always after their own wilderness. More surprising is the participation of Europe. One would be hard pressed to think of a time when the old world and that American frontier seemed more impossibly distant. Yet the Belgian Bram Devens has traversed time, ocean and the war to speak the language of that great wilderness. Devens borrowed his moniker from a fitting piece of Americana, the malevolent brick-hurling mouse Ignatz of George Hermann's celebrated pre-war cartoon strip, Krazy Kat. On his eponymous debut, Ignatz casts his bricks in brutally slow motion and lets them careen into vast darkness. Ignatz is oddly glorious. Not unlike Robert Lowe's fine Lichens project, Devens conjures sparsely with guitar, pedals, and sampler. Slow, twanging guitar chords open the album on ""Rebound from the Cliff"". Devens barks out barely comprehensible lyrics in a thick reverberating drawl, like some cybernetic Dock Boggs. The song is soon subsumed into a flurry of melodious finger-picking treated to sound like an amped-up player piano, looping into ruin. The somber ""Echo All Acoustically Correct"" follows, no more than spectral folk punctuated by spurts of tar black noise. On the grand and ethereal acoustic number ""I Look at Her with the Euh"", Devens wails like Roscoe Holcomb on nitrous oxide, his cartoonishly high-pitched vocals ever shading into inhuman distortion. Again, Devens croons deliriously over zombie blues and bells on ""The Radiant Sheen"", a track that would sit comfortably on either volume of Flynt's own Backporch Hillbilly Blues, or just about any entry in the Sun City Girls' Carnival Folklore Resurrection series, rising from gas-addled jaunt to a cracked no wave crescendo of busted guitar carnage. ""All My Hopes Have Collapsed"" is corroded bluegrass, as if reconstructed by Matthew Bower under his Sunroof! moniker-- all static and scree. The mandolin-like runs sound jury-rigged from alien sources, the hollow foot stomp slowed to a dead knock. The album resolves in the eight-minute epic ""The Sinister Snow Squaws"". A simple, mournful melody is reiterated against an insistently ringing throb, like the wind through steel wires. Crippled guitars duel as the wind evolves into thick miasma, descending like a pall over everything and yielding finally to silence. Listen carefully and you will catch the real American folk revival unfolding, not the bearded acoustics of handsome hippies and earnest neo-troubadours. It lies behind them and beneath them, and yes, even in Brussels. The music is noisy and untrammeled. It does not speak of clouds and it does not speak of justice. But it will occasionally undertake the hard work of all true folk music, which is reckoning with the gravity of the past. And at its best, it will find the New World old again, ineluctably old.","Not unlike Robert Lowe's fine Lichens project, this oddly glorious record conjures ""new American ethnic music"" with guitar, pedals, and sampler.

See You on the Moon!: Songs for Kids of All Ages,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8699d034d5c69bf3a31/1:1/w_160/271216e3.jpg,2006-03-22 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2118-see-you-on-the-moon-songs-for-kids-of-all-ages/,Paper Bag,"It's hard to keep up with the kids these days. They're getting so...old. Finding a job and having a mewling child or two used to mean saying goodbye to the days of obsessive-compulsive music snobbery. Now the internet cuts out the conventional legwork and here's a clever compilation of kiddie pop for aging indie-yuppies, with more reportedly on the way. Yes, folks, See You on the Moon!: Song for Kids of All Ages leaves Raffi in the deep blue sea and lets Kidz Bop float on, all right, already. It's definitely better than the old For Our Children disc-- featuring Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Debbie Gibson-- I remember hearing once or twice in the parental Toyota Previa. But as that effort showed, merely hiring A-list talent (and Debbie Gibson) doesn't guarantee success when trying to rock the cradle. Paper Bag's compilation enlists some Pitchfork darlings-- most notably Broken Social Scene and Sufjan Stevens-- and a few lesser-knowns for a brilliant marketing gambit that actually turns out not to suck. The best entries on See You on the Moon! are steeped with a sense of practical-minded wonderment. Great Lake Swimmers' ""See You on the Moon"" runs eagerly through a list of possible careers, indulging a child's attention to detail (""I'll drive my tractor in the sun/ While the chickens go bawk, bawk, bawk/ and the cows go moo, moo, moo""), while catchy acoustic guitars ring, ring, ring. ""Be Nice to People With Lice"", Low's Alan Sparhawk's solo acoustic opener, similarly features an easy sing-along melody and adult-friendly one-liners (cf. the title), but it's marred by the sounds of grown-up laughter and ""best-song-ever"" half-sarcasm. Lice are deadly serious, dudes. Parents just don't understand. Broken Social Scene's spacey, subtly psychedelic ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" cover is a cause for Honah-Lee frolicking. Meanwhile, Sufjan Stevens does his usual Jesus thing (but seriously, stop asking him about it, you vultures), turning in a toy-orchestra take on French carol ""The Friendly Beasts""-- also featured on his Christmas album triad. Mark Kozelek's ""Leo and Luna"" is a slow, Red House Painters-like lullaby that also makes for a nice two-minute subway oasis, but Hot Chip's uncharacteristically boring ""I Can't Wake Up"" forgets that kids have awesome bullshit detectors. And heck, FemBots' growly Waits/Beefheart polka on ""Under the Bed"" gives me nightmares. As with any children's compilation, See You on the Moon! has a few tracks parents will want to skip. The kids' shouty chanting on space-age double-dutch ""24 Robbers"", by BSS member Apostle of Hustle, is cute but gets old even faster than children do-- try the Go! Team instead. Kid Koala's ""Fruit Bat"", featuring Lederhosen Lucil, gets nicely cartoon-like, but be warned I'll step on any toddler I hear repeating its chorus of ""I 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ate you"". Montag's three brief instrumentals, though, are soothing, culminating in the glistening ""Bonne Nuit Etienne"". Rosie Thomas' lovely, dream-like ""Faith's Silver Elephant"" is a real children's song, tucking an achingly sung story of a girl and her magical mammal pals into a bed of softest down. It also evokes the weird, unspoken fantasy behind buying an indie kid's-music comp in this age of ubiquitous over-parenting: ""Wait and see/ I'll be the coolest kid around.""","Subtitled ""Songs for Kids of All Ages"", this Paper Bag compilation features indie artists such as Sufjan Stevens, Broken Social Scene, and Junior Boys performing children's songs.

Bring It Back,Mates of State,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3db5e6ef95969323914/1:1/w_160/c305f023.jpg,2006-03-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5148-bring-it-back/,Barsuk,"OK, synths are great, but it's unlikely the guitar will loosen its hegemony on rock anytime soon. So the odds Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the organ-and-drums duo that goes by Mates of State, will create a mutiny with their cuddly AM pop are slim to nil. Facing improbable odds hasn't dampened the plucky twosome's spirit, but it has wizened them up. On Bring It Back, their fourth album, they gingerly lift the moratorium on six-strings-- a few lurk in the background throughout the record-- and explore a more varied sonic palette. The fattened sound, however, doesn't mean an altered band, just a better one. Mates of State have always been fascinated by the dark, haunted corners of glistening pop melodies, and Bring It Back finds their fixation vibrant as ever. Gardner plays a Yamaha Electone organ from circa 1970, which produces wet, hollow sounds rich in spooky overtones. On previous efforts, the slinky loop that opens ""Think Long"" would've constituted the track's sole melody. Simple lines, left alone, echoing large-- they were Broadcast before Broadcast were Broadcast. But Bring It Back features Mates of State's fullest songs, and many of their longest. The added length lets them be characteristically piecemeal-- ""We attach parts together until they make a whole song,"" they claim on their website-- while deeper orchestration provides the adhesive previous efforts lacked. If ""Proofs"", from 2000's My Solo Project, represents one possible (and thrilling) result of the couple's chemistry, Bring It Back suggests another. When the latter paired a spare, roomy drumbeat with a loping, calliope-style organ line and impassioned vocal teamwork, two was the magic number. New album opener ""Think Long"", meanwhile, takes along third and fourth wheels with overdubbed keyboard harmonies, accessory percussion, and multi-tracked vocals. By the group's previous standard, ""For the Actor"", which makes a joyous racket of music box twinkles and gilt trumpet, would be considered perfidious. Atop a surfeit of accoutrements, it offers the album's most guitar-like sound: the same distorted Rhodes piano feint Sufjan Stevens used to scuzz up his Trans-Siberian orchestral ""Detroit"". Gardner has a flair for linear, almost arpeggiated combinations of notes, and her keyboard parts give Mates of States' songs a light, sweeping quality. But on ""Nature and the Wreck"", a delicate piano line gusts so heavily it almost blows away. Luckily, they keep it brief, allowing the track to work as a placeholder. Gardner incorporates a husky Steinway more tastefully on ""Like U Crazy"", the lungs to ""Nature and the Wreck""'s heart. Offsetting the track's vapory piano descend, Gardner's little-voice-that-could coos atop a rickety, rim-clicking beat. ""I-I-I-I like u crazy,"" she hooks, but her breathy falsetto vowels are all that matter. Weakened knees collapse entirely when Hammel starts in with the blue-eyed wop-wop-oooos, turning the track into an unlikely Righteous Brothers homage, which is good news for everyone. Meanwhile, check how the bass propels the vocal hook on ""Beautiful Dreamer"" and you'll be seeing Stars (not the thing, the Canadian pop juggernaut), who also specialize in galloping, lovesick refrains. ""For the Actor"" not only imitates that band's joyous gait but their penchant for sudden, shattered breakdowns, too. Atop whimsical keys instead of chugging axes, Gardner's heart-in-hands vociferations listen less like blustery emo and more like...heart-in-hands vociferations. Which answers the question, What are sickeningly cute young couples good for if not making pop records? Producing them, of course. Seriously, if Gardner and Hammel could use a little monetary padding, they ought to consider pitching Kelly Clarkson a melody. They're one of the few pop bands who can pull off love ballad earnestness without being unintentionally funny. ""Beautiful Dreamer"" features a bridge of the kind that made ""Since U Been Gone"" a winner-- catchy, uninhibited, and awash in open hi-hat. There's only one difference: guitar is nowhere to be found.","Organ-and-drums duo gingerly lift the moratorium on six-strings and explore a more varied sonic palette, resulting in their best album to date.

From the Cliffs,Guillemots,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02d5e6ef959693234f0/1:1/w_160/585a494f.jpg,2006-03-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3690-from-the-cliffs/,Fantastic Plastic,"Some people look good on the dancefloor; others prefer to stand in the shadows. Some people want to live forever; others know all too well they won't. And for those who didn't buy Whatever You Say I Am, That's What I'm Not on the first day of release during lunch hour at the Oxford HMV, here are Guillemots, who are to the Arctic Libershambles what the Beta Band were to Oasis in 1998, or what Badly Drawn Boy was to Travis in 2000-- a detour away from everyday pub-rock pabulum toward something more tasteful, more adventurous. Guillemots' collective CVs-- singer/chief songwriter Fyfe Dangerfield (no, it's not real) and bassist Aristazabal Hawkes have formal classical training; guitarist MC Lord Magrao is a Brazillian with noise/metal pedigree-- make the London band sound like a bigger mess than they actually are. Together, they make adult-contemporary/contemptuous pop music. But where the Betas and Badly Drawn Boy strove to be both eccentric and accessible at the same time, the Guillemots are more pragmatic: they release improv studio jams through website downloads, while saving the proper tunes for their major-label debut, From the Cliffs. The approach pays immediate dividends: From the Cliffs practically tumbles down the stairs with ""Trains to Brazil"", a triumphant clarion call that's worth a main-stage slot at Glastonbury alone. Like Doves' stellar 2005 single, ""Black and White Town"", it's the sound of dreary, grey skies starting to bleed light, its Motown momentum undercut by a sobering bridge-- ""Be thankful you're here/ Because it could be you tomorrow or next year""-- before blindsiding you with a brass-blasted chorus that'll make you see stars. But in the tradition of latter-day Talk Talk or post-Kid A Radiohead, Guillemots aren't so concerned with perfecting performances as illuminating the dimly lit space around them. Their obsession with atmosphere is felt most intensely on the slumberous nine-minute masterstroke ""Over the Stairs"", which imagines Paul McCartney sleepwalking through Mercury Rev's Catskills in the dead of night: candelabra-lit balladry haunted by spirits speaking in tongues, guided by possibly the most unsettling wind chimes ever committed to tape. Too bad the Guillemots' phantasmagoric fascinations go unexplored on the From the Cliffs' second act. Instead, the swinging, dinner-party pop of ""Who Left the Lights Off Baby"" sounds like it should soundtrack some Hugh Grant romantic comedy (it even comes with an egregious sax solo for the credits roll), while would-be climax ""Go Away"" is a cod-reggae exercise burdened with a whiny, wordless chorus and an unconvincingly tough vocal from Dangerfield. But even in their most pedestrian turns, Guillemots songs abound with all manner of sublimated sonic chicanery-- kettle whistles, alarm clocks, schoolyard giggles, squeaky bird noises-- suggesting that something far more beguiling is lurking beneath the surface. ","As exemplified by the excellent ""Trains to Brazil"" single, this UK band takes a detour away from everyday pub-rock pabulum toward something more adventurous.

55:12,Gregor Samsa,by: Cory D.

In the interim, a split with Red Sparrowes was released and quickly sold out, but the band is just finally issuing its phenomenal debut, which features a mix of hushed beauty, dark, dense melodies, and soft, co-ed vocals. The band's sound features many of the stronger characteristics of vocal post-rock: The songs generally wrap up around the seven-minute mark, and feature quiet atmospherics between loud outbursts of guitar and drums. Melodies build over the course of a track, rarely shifting gears quickly but leaving plenty of room for the instruments to interplay, creating a fabric of sound in which layers are packed densely and no single musician overtakes the others. Co-vocalists Nikki King and Champ Bennett play off of one another but rarely overlap. Bennett's vocals are so low that at times they're almost a mumble, while King's angelic voice floats dream-like over the music beneath it. On the album opener, ""Makeshift Shelters"", their voices harmonize over warped piano and manipulated tape droning; it isn't until a few minutes into ""Even Numbers"" that the band erupts, dispelling any concern about this being a strictly ambient affair. The players excel at building tension through a use of negative space. On ""Loud and Clear"", the instruments drop off, leaving a lonely guitar to calmly pick away. After a minute or so, King's soft voice can be heard in the background, providing delicate vocals. ""We'll Lean That Way Forever"" is another experiment in ambiance and effects. Here, quiet guitar feedback is augmented by vocals from King that were put to tape six months prior to the rest of the album. Her voice has been twisted and warped, adding a haunting sense of otherworldliness to the track. But the strongest moments sprinkled throughout 55:12 are those when softer, more peaceful sounds are contrasted with bursts of driving up-tempo melody. It may not be a new formula, but Gregor Samsa manage to breathe some life into it.","This long-awaited album features a mix of hushed beauty, dense melodies, and soft, co-ed vocals.

Born Again in the USA,Loose Fur,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd55c0084474cd0c2c96/1:1/w_160/1ef6bc7f.jpg,2006-03-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4854-born-again-in-the-usa/,Drag City,"Although Loose Fur's 2003 debut sprawled and streched its way to nowhere fast, the album's tangential importance is undeniable. Recorded in summer 2000, it documents the early of stages of the Jeff Tweedy/Jim O'Rourke mind-meld as well as drummer Glenn Kotche's introduction to Wilcoworld. If he never made strange squawks with Loose Fur, Tweedy may not have amassed the courage to make Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or shove Jay Bennett and his tangled old-white-guy dreads toward indie oblivion; without Loose Fur, the remarkable solo on ""At Least That's What You Said"" may still be a mere guitar-god figment and ""pretentious Wilco"" would probably still sound something like ""Via Chicago"". Considering how this informal trio apparently played such a large role in uncovering the more experimental cells underneath Tweedy's skull, it's ironic that the relatively straightforward Born Again in the USA is more musically traditional than some of Wilco's recent output. With tapes and tapes of formal collaborations now behind them, the boys are past the ""feeling out"" stage and onto making proper songs. Just check the track lengths: Whereas only one Loose Fur track clocked in at under five minutes, Born Again only has one that goes over that mark. Basking in the sun-dried guitar echoes of the Eagles, the Byrds, and the Grateful Dead, Born Again is sturdy classic rock revivalism sans stupefied jamming. Adding even more structure and continuity is a satirical godlessness that binds several songs together. As the punny title suggests, much of the LP confronts religion with a sly, blue state smirk. ""The Ruling Class"" tells a dubious account of a crack 'n' smack messiah who's ""drinkin' beer, just trying to get down."" Sung by Tweedy, the aim is secular comedy motivated by biting social critique, but the sarcasm sounds smug-- even when deflated by an easygoing smiling-whistle refrain. The same complaint can be lobbed at ""Thou Shall Wilt"", which finds O'Rourke offering running commentary for the Ten Commandments (to No. 4, ""Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy,"" the singer responds, ""[It's] such a pain, this Sabbath thing is so arcane/ I don't want to desecrate, my only day to sleep in late""). Such Bible-baiting is mildly amusing at first but quickly succumbs to novelty-- especially for an emotional martyr like Tweedy, who tackled similar territory with peaceful poise on A Ghost Is Born's ""Theologians"". Luckily, Born Again regularly sidesteps its clunky central theme for Tweedy and O'Rourke's songwriting specialty: pained reflections on relationship dysfunction. With its circular acoustic guitar pattern and hushed sense of folky foreboding, O'Rourke's ""Answers to Your Questions"" could have found a home on one of his poppier solo records. Predictably, the titular responses are devastating: ""You always write to ask how come I don't write back/ Well, I could tell you/ But then I'd have to write a letter that would start/ 'I finally found it in my heart not to forgive you'""). His soothing delivery quivering alongside a slight crescendo of xylophone and precise picking, O'Rourke shades his detachment from a dumped ex with palpable ache. The same goes for Born Again's finale, ""Wanted"", the most Wilco-ish track in the Loose Fur canon thus far. Boppy piano accompanies a classic Tweedy opening salvo: ""When I say that she's a rapist/ That really isn't what I mean."" The song's approach to sexual awakening includes religious overtones and questions of lust vs. saintliness but stays devoid of any holier-than-thou posturing. Wounded and feeling ambiguously abused, Tweedy's narrator defends his indiscretions, ""She's not so well rounded, she has points you don't see/ She does whatever she wants, and I swear she wanted me."" Topped with an air-guitar-worthy dollop of harmonized six-strings, the song wraps up in just three minutes but its confused longing lingers. There's no doubt Born Again is superior to its predecessor in nearly every respect. Even the eight-plus minutes of ""Wreckroom""-- complete with Tweedy surrealities, wafting solos, and ambient denoument-- are more purposeful than anything on Loose Fur. But, since the album's sharpest moments largely serve to underline the individual strengths of its more well known songwriters rather than the group as a unit, it acts as a teasing appetizer for new O'Rourke and Wilco full-lengths more than it satisfies in its own right.","Second Loose Fur collaboration between Jeff Tweedy, Jim O'Rourke, and Glenn Kotche is more musically traditional than not only its predecessor but some of Wilco's recent output as well.

Detour Allure,Charlemagne,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7055e6ef95969320e98/1:1/w_160/35285fe3.jpg,2006-03-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1762-detour-allure/,SideCho,"Carl Johns makes the kind of power pop that takes me back to a time I'm not sure ever existed. His Charlemagne project, now two albums old, cooks up music for a breezy summer drive, stuffed with wispy male/female harmonies, strummed guitars, and airily recorded drums. It evokes the indie rock of the mid-90s in hi-er fi, and the power pop of the post-punk era with modern amenities like more deeply nuanced synthesizer tones and high-quality production on a low budget. Detour Allure rings with an abundance of sharp melodies and quick tempos, arranged with a minimum of fuss. Spare flourishes of synth and special effects guitar spice up the proceedings, offering shiny accents to sometimes workmanlike compositions. ""Your Scars"" trips along on a nice two-step country beat and features some unexpected chord changes for its wordless middle eight. It's followed by the album's finest track, ""In the Fuselage"", a weirdly catchy song that earns its place in your memory with an inventive melody delivered via mellow, introverted harmonies. ""Fave Unknown"" takes a crunchier route, riding fuzzy bass and buzzing keyboard hooks. Though consistency of craft is one of Charlemagne's strengths, there are a few bits that don't work, like the unfortunate rhyming of ""cherries,"" ""very,"" ""scary,"" and ""berries"" in the otherwise catchy ""Pink & Silver"" and the overly ponderous closer ""Hello September"", which ends the album with too much whimper and not enough bang. By and large, though, Charlemagne's sophomore effort is an enjoyable, if not exactly innovative, album, best served warm with a light breeze.","Breezy summer indie pop stuffed with wispy male/female harmonies, strummed guitars, and airily recorded drums.

Murray's Revenge,Murs,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c419eb335119a49ed882/1:1/w_160/c0546f5c.jpg,2006-03-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5515-murrays-revenge/,Recordcollection,"My long-running feud with 9th Wonder's wet-waxpaper snares is now officially dead and buried. From now on, whether it is true or not, I will weave into my moral fiber the belief that he is a shepherd of the club nouveau of punk ethos hip-hop-- fueled more by intention than skill. He produced every track on Murs' last album, Murs 3:16, which I liked, and every track on the follow-up Murray's Revenge, which I like nearly as much. After a year in which the trap-hop/coke-rap contingent ground the internets to dust, I can appreciate a record that does not contain one nigga, bitch, faggot, brick, time served, or clip emptied, and still is not a steaming mess of defanged braggadocio about commitment to the four elements. There is a limit on both sides, and Murs seems to have found the median where he can talk about himself without sounding self-absorbed. He speaks on topics as varied as racial identity (""Dark-Skinned White Girls""), a nice fade (""Barbership""), and fidelity (""Love & Affection"") with a charming aplomb weaned equally on (old) Death Row and the Good Life Café, both of which were not far removed from his home section in the Mid-City area. Similar to the Kanye-hyped Lupe Fiasco, Murs is an artist whose appeal is grounded in his honesty about not being a gangster even though he grew up around some. He calls out fake thugs not with accusations of hip-hop treason or murderous threats but a challenge to a gentlemanly fistfight, describes South Central as not all that bad, doesn't have a chain because his mom would have killed him, and boasts about his prowess like a modern-day Positive K. He's even tempered some of the misogyny that made bits of 3:16 non-Mom-friendly, though he is not yet to Common levels of Millennial Man gender equity. Murs may not inspire myspace shrines like Slug or blog jack-offs like Ghostface, but he's once again made a record that should not alienate fans of either. Maybe that makes him the Broken Social Scene of hip-hop, I don't know, but with the kind of production from 9th Wonder that seems to improve when removed from the comforts of Little Brother, Murray's Revenge is one of the better gang-unrelated and Dre-unaffiliated records to come from the West Coast since Murs' last one.","The follow-up to the excellent 3:16 may not inspire the devotion enjoyed by myspace hero Slug or blogger's fave Ghostface but it will appeal to fans of both.

3121,Prince,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13613d1975652138593/1:1/w_160/5e04c5ff.jpg,2006-03-20 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6481-3121/,Interscope,"There was a time when Prince was the gold standard for artistic expansion. Each of his opuses forayed into some new arena, and every shift in his approach correspondingly increased the size of the venues he toured. For more than a decade he was unstoppable, picking up the freaky funk baton from George Clinton and parlaying it into genuine superstardom. Funny, though, how short the trip from top of the pops to ""News of the Weird"" marginalization can be-- after changing his name to an unpronounceable ""love symbol"" in the early 1990s, he spent the better part of a decade roaming the wilderness, kicking out poorly distributed albums that ironically might have reached a larger audience had he not split from Warner Brothers to go it alone. From an image perspective, the New Power Generation era saw Prince transformed into a bizarre caricature of righteousness, religious and otherwise. But just as the path from peaks to lows can be quickly traversed, artists can swing back just as quickly, and 2004's Musicology gathered plaudits by the bushel, partially restoring Prince's critical reputation, as well as his commercial fortunes. In retrospect, it seems that Musicology was labeled a comeback in essence for not being an embarrassment. 3121 does a bit better than that, coming up with a handful of infectious songs-- it's his best since the symbol record, although certainly there remains a massive chasm between it and his masterpieces. Speaking in terms of his classic era, 3121 is more ""Gett Off"" than ""Nothing Compares 2 U"". The opening title track works almost entirely on eccentricity, as a huge crowd of pitch-shifted Princes harmonize on lyrics that basically amount to directions to a party. On the other end of the record, ""Get on the Boat"" boasts a sharp horn arrangement (with solos from Maceo Parker, no less) and a funk undercarriage vintage enough to have come straight from a thrift-shop basement-- and the loose, live feel doesn't hurt either. One thing that ""Get on the Boat"" exhibits in its piano part and timbale eruptions is a Latin influence that's more pervasive on 3121 than on any previous Prince album. ""Te Amo Corazon"" is a nicely nuanced ballad built on a slow, slightly rock-tinged mambo beat, and there are snatches of Cuban piano and Brazilian drums that crop up all over. Crunchy electro is the dominant strain in most of the album's best tracks, though, including the killer single ""Black Sweat"", the fractured keyboard riff of ""Lolita"", and ""Love"", inhabited by squishy keyboard and a monster chorus that slashes the ascending melody with buzzing synth bass. ""The Word"" strikes a nice electro-acoustic dichotomy, layering spacey synthesizer and a programmed beat with acoustic guitar and a strong sax hook. If the entire album were up to these levels, we'd be onto something, but ""Fury"" tempers the impact of its stunning lead guitar part with a hopelessly dated keyboard patch and generic rock drumming. ""Incense & Candles"" is predictable bedroom r&b; that relies too heavily on manipulated vocals, swerving into a little rap-like passage exactly when I began to think, ""I bet there's a little rap-like passage in this song."" He might have at least brought in a guest to deliver something more interesting. So, two albums into a career revival, Prince is still only kinda sorta ""back."" He's never going to be as surprising as he was in his heyday, of course, and it's probably unfair to expect anything like that from him again. All told, 3121 is a pretty ordinary-sounding record, largely stuck in another, friendlier sonic decade-- namely the 80s. If nothing else, Prince is slowly regaining the plot, and of course, there remain plenty of great old records in his catalog to revisit while he finds it.","On his latest release, the rock legend betters his work on comeback album Musicology, crafting a record that's more varied and contains higher peaks than its predecessor.

Dins,Psychic Ills,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b1c0084474cd0bfe83/1:1/w_160/be2a55ba.jpg,2006-03-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6596-dins/,Social Registry,"I've never caught Psychic Ills live, but...four NYCers with a stiffy for psych-rock space rituals? No wonder they keep their hair at face-shielding length. When casting out into the improvisatory dark, eye contact is off limits. You're in a private headspace, where doing your thing right means doing it to the exclusion of external phenomena. The more withdrawn each individual member, the more cohesive the group dynamic: Is this meditation class? No, it's the paradox by which Dins lives and dies. Suffice it to call the Ills a jam band: Dins eschews conventional structure and blurs the line between song and improvisation-- there are eight tracks here but fewer tunes. The album's opening sweep tucks its only riff three minutes deep into ""Electriclife"", the second track, buttressing it on both sides with liquid metallic noise. Amid the seeming chaos, sudden spurts of song are actually quite effective-- they don't come across as submerged, but rather as standing sentry over the teeming formlessness. My only wish is for a little more synthesis; Dins is often overly simplistic, playing the soft/loud game rather than tackling the more complicated task of consolidation. After all, noise and melody need not be mutually exclusive. But that's a choice not a maxim, so I won't say closer ""Another Day Another Night"" suddenly ""gets it,"" but rather just follows the tack of forebearers like My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, and Hawkwind. Riding a galloping, less drum-circular tom rhythm, Psychic Ills heap on whooshes of vox, cavernous guitar trills, and flecks of sublime, barely audible glockenspiel. The volume holds steady, resisting the call to climax with gratuitous feedback and flailing drum fills. Instead we get a beautiful, legible guitar solo-- the line we've waited an album for. The song is breezy at eight-plus minutes where a bottom-heavy track like ""January Rain"" sorta slogs despite finishing in under six. This well-rendered, highly enjoyable debut drags on me the same way as that Black Mountain LP did. Both albums have wonderful moments but their creators are a little too comfortable in their own sloth. Maybe it's a drugs-unlock-it thing-- a valid excuse in their book, maybe, but not mine. Or maybe Psychic Ills are feeling each other out as improvisational musicians-- a process that can take years-- while learning the contours of one of rock's most challenging idioms.","This NYC quartet eschews conventional structure and keeps the line between song and improv blurry.

In a Space Outta Sound,Nightmares on Wax,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fa5e6ef9596932395c/1:1/w_160/5e2dc33d.jpg,2006-03-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5795-in-a-space-outta-sound/,Warp,"As 1989 teetered on the edge of a new decade, something called Nightmares on Wax released a single called ""Dextrous"" on a nothing record label Outta the north of England called Warp. The record's drums were crude like a fingerpainting and its amelodic vreeps and klungs were what guys who spent too much time in dark warehouses called hooks. But its bass sound-- queerly metallic and low as it could go-- could clear up that sinus problem you've been having. In the fall of 1990, NoW released ""Aftermath"", similarly queasy to ""Dextrous"", with the junkie's paranoia bonus of a shrill loop of female vocals that spiraled like an Outta control body on the dancefloor. These early singles were part of the ""bleep"" sub-sub-genre of Northern English rave that established Warp as the label we know today, bringing us almost two decades worth of forward thinking electronic music by acts like Gravenhurst and Maxïmo Park. By 1991, when NoW released its debut album, A Word of Science, it had abandoned the anonymity of white label singles for a rainbow-hued cartoon cover with the names George Evelyn and Kevin Harper attached to it. The album included the earlier bleep singles, but the meat were the mid-tempo hip-hop tracks full of whimsical steel drums and Steve Miller Band samples. The next album didn't appear until 1995; by then Harper had gone and possibly taken the wit (and definitely the bass) with him. 1999's Carboot Soul improbably found Evelyn signed to Pavement's label in that strange late-'90s moment when Matador went about becoming an electronic label by signing/licensing all sorts of wack shit. (Burger/Ink excepted.) By then Evelyn had settled on the golden mean of downtempo: slow hip-hop breaks and wobbly-boom basslines, plus some instrumental textures in place of so-20th-century musical concerns like harmony or melodic development, and voices there to punctuate drum loops rather than express feelings, tell stories, or give you something to hum in line at the DMV. This is why the average person does not need more than one or two downtempo albums. Banana Republic/cocktail lounge jokes may seem like cheap grousing in 2006, but the records keep coming. Like every downtempo producer, Evelyn has his moments, and mostly they're felicitous combinations of texture that are just a little prettier or hypnotic than the competition. But he's rarely surprising, 'cause that would be gauche. In a Space Outta Sound opens with ""Passion"", almost seven minutes of beats-and-strings with firefly flickers of organ that could be the downtempo platonic ideal if that didn't make it sound better that it actually is. The sepia-tinted (of course) cover photo features a bank of loosely lashed together mobile soundsystem speakers, and Evelyn draws much from reggae, especially its trilling guitars and low-end theories. (Not particularly surprising considering downtempo sits almost exactly between reggae's lope and hip-hop's boom-bap.) Sadly the two best (read: different) tracks come at the end, a shame because you'll have probably put on something closer to actual music by then. ""Soul Purpose"" is trip-hop if it had been born in sun-soaked Miami rather than drizzly Bristol; an 808 booms and pings in the bottom and some strings drift off the top, like a screwed version of the girly, wistful booty bass of Ghost Town DJ's ""My Boo"". ""African Pirates"" juggles a few bongo patterns for the only track with an interesting rhythm, but, in keeping with downtempo's beanbag/crash pad aesthetic, the interest is cerebral-- it sounds good to your ears but won't do much for the stuff below the neck. But, and it's a big but: lots of electronic music that the casual consumer couldn't differentiate from downtempo gets dap from e-heads who profess to hate downtempo. Listening to Theo Parrish's First Floor directly following In a Sound, you realize there's often not much melodic development or rhythmic variation in Parrish's highly touted music either. But the difference, at least as far as I can figure, is something Parrish articulates in titles like ""Dusty Cabinets"" and ""Ugly Edits"". His music is fuzzier, funkier, crunkier, it retains the grit of the music that inspired it that, grit that downtempo traded for ""perfect"" engineering when it became a genre that got its own section in the store. Evelyn could do with letting his machinery grow out and stay unwashed, cuz In a Sound just reminds you of the best shampooing you ever got.","Warp presents this comeback album from the bleeps n' bloops and trip-hop pioneers.

The canon wields a heavy hammer-- strike Invaders with it, and you can cross metal shows off your list of things to do this summer-- and then again, so do 18 guitar-dragging loud rock bands. Bonus question: Would you rather be Flex Your Head, or 20 Years of Dischord? Most days, I figure Invaders for the former. This peak comes after a long climb of metalists, well, playing metal: The Fucking Champs slogging since 1994, Torche dudes pounding in their last band Floor since 1993, Big Business predecessors Karp around since 1995, High on Fire's Matt Pike and his former band Sleep since 1991, Witch drummer J Mascis all the way back to Deep Wound, formed in 1982. Best, perhaps, is the good this transformation's done for those who wanted to be about to rock but were having trouble figuring out how. Try Saviours, who with ""Circle of Servants Bodies"", finally lay down the emotional-hardcore sing-songy plowshears of their former band Yaphet Kotto for the earthier salt of tom fills and big sustain, topped off with amalgamated Dio and Maiden solo-run riffs. From the sound of it, these dudes were just happy to find out that metal existed; now they swing with all the West Coast energy Yaphet Kotto had promised and then eventually bled out. Big Business, for their part, go from a murderously tight Karp to an even tighter clenched two-piece bass and drums rolling grenade: They're as locked up as all the years they played together would dictate, yet still manage to swim in the wake of their own songs. ""As the Day Was Dawning"" moves so deliberately it seems to have only half-dead listeners in mind, which, when corpse-paint catches on again, will no doubt be appropriate. Pelican, High on Fire, and Dungen all do credible versions of Pelican, High on Fire, and Dungen, but let's talk the high skinny cut-off jean-jacket nerd quotient: Black Mountain's Doors organs and Wanna Buy a Bridge sax jamming, Danava's proggy/techy almost no-wave take on metal, constantly twitching and sniffing and scratching over shifty bass and ""Osbournes"" Ozzy vocals, and Witch, who sound simultaneously gigantic and like their lead singer has a high-school beatings derived speech impediment. Kemado's war-elephant in the room, mining such an already-alive genre (Black Sabbath, Motörhead, Celtic Frost, etc., all still around, at least sort of), is the ironic carpetbagger factor: Are these bands griming up metal's happy rainbow like so much Bushwick real-estate? Here, Invaders is saved by its own hyper-loserdom: even the next-big-things on here, such as The Sword, never break the frame-- it's all D&D;, all the time-- and others, such as The Champs and their ilk, essentially share a niche with Steve Vai or Yngwie Malmsteen. Just don't listen when they foist this stuff on ya: ""The unenlightened epoch of hairlessness became a fleeting memory as their second-hand sweaters grew holes, unraveled, and were fashioned into gnarled headbands."" If you're not now, you never were.","Kemado collects the cream of the hipster metal crop on this compilation, which features Pelican, Wolfmother, High on Fire, Dungen, Black Mountain, and the Sword, among others.

When the Going Gets Dark,Quasi,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c99d034d5c69bf2a39/1:1/w_160/4279cfbb.jpg,2006-03-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6620-when-the-going-gets-dark/,Touch and Go,"When I interviewed Janet Weiss in London last year, the drummer talked enthusiastically about Sleater-Kinney's experience recording their latest album, The Woods, with revered engineer Dave Fridmann. She enthused about the importance of letting go and stretching beyond self-imposed boundaries in order to capture the intensity and unpredictability of the sessions. The result was arguably the band's best album to date. It's unsurprising then that Weiss chose to experiment in a similar field with Quasi's seventh release, When the Going Gets Dark, returning to Fridmann to polish off the recordings. ""There's a lot of distortion on everything, and I think the distortion eventually becomes the entity,"" said Weiss of Sleater-Kinney's playing on The Woods. ""It becomes the guts of the music."" That embrace of fuzzed-out lows and grimy distortion-- as well as extended improvisations and looser song structures-- fizzles through the backbone of When the Going Gets Dark. Her singer/songwriter ex-husband Sam Coomes, who makes up the other half of the Portland, Ore.-based duo, ditches Quasi's signature keyboard sound in favor of emphatically tumbling piano, which is added to feedback and raucous, challenging, defiant vocal melodies. Coomes intermittently howls and screams between the Jerry Lee Lewis-style staccato riff chaos of ""The Rhino"", and the soprano whoops on the title track sound like a sharp blade running over the deep spread of bass and Weiss' clattering drums. The only real rub lies in the lyrics, which-- unusually for the sharp-minded Coomes-- veer between cringing and faintly ridiculous, such as, ""I'm stuck in a tree, doing my thing with the chimpanzees."" It's not only the evident friction born from an extended working and personal relationship that catalyses their sound. Weiss is a remarkable, unpredictable drummer, and the pair play perfectly together, having reached the point at which improvisation becomes the result of an intuitive locking of creative minds. Standout tracks such as the mainly instrumental, knotty jazz of ""Death Culture Blues"" and ""Presto Change-O"" show how much more vitality and room to breathe the pair have when not focused on studio trickery or elaborate overdubbing. And although the song eventually collapses into a darkly syrupy shamble of good tidings, the opening bars of ""Merry X-Mas""-- which feature an outbreak of edgy-yet-glitzy piano notes evaporating into a captivating solo and the pounding rhythms of Weiss's kit-- reveal that Quasi have cast their net wider and tighter with the impulse of their revived energy.","Portland, Ore.-based duo Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney) and Sam Coomes embraces fuzzed-out lows, grimy distortion, extended improvisations, and looser song structures.

Bitter Honey,Eef Barzelay,by: Stephen M.

So Eef Barzelay begins his first solo album, Bitter Honey. But before you get visions of the bespectacled indie folkster shaking his rump at the camera, the Clem Snide frontman makes it clear that he's in character. He's speaking for an anonymous video extra, a faceless woman reduced to a bobbing buttocks captured in close-up. It's potentially problematic, a white man speaking for a black woman, and the first verse is a caricature, with Barzelay singing, ""All those hoochie skanks ain't gotten shit on me/ And one of Nelly's bodyguards he totally agreed."" Barzelay, however, uses that distance between singer and subject-- between male and female, black and white, indie folk and mainstream hip-hop-- to generate a poignant sort of empathy. It's not long before he's fleshing out the cartoon, tracing her life from working-class childhood to her attempt at nursing school: ""but all those broken bodies they really got to me."" It's her fear of death that drives her to flaunt her body, and Barzelay presents her as sympathetic and contradictory, naïve in her world-weariness: ""Don't hate me 'cause I know just what this world is all about."" Once the song ends, Barzelay leaves the hip-hop world behind for the quotidian quarrels and never-speak-aloud daydreams that plague long-term relationships. On ""N.M.A. (Nothing Means Anything)"" an innocent question-- ""What was that actress's name?""-- prompts an argument that's pathetic for being so banal: ""I watched as you picked at your food and so perfectly darkened the mood."" That mood is indeed dark, especially on ""Words That Escape Me"". Barzelay imagines his lover's death in a car accident, ""just to see how I would look by the ambulance light with a grief-stricken face and the thought that we've never been closer."" The spare acoustic setting only makes the sentiment more self-consciously self-absorbed. Not everything on Bitter Honey is so grim, fortunately. ""Thanksgiving Waves"" churns a great bit of intensity despite being just Barzelay and his guitar, as he imagines traveling again once this war is over. The short ""Little Red Dot"" sounds crisp like early springtime, and not just because of the ambient birdsong. And the closer, a nearly a cappella version of ""Joy to the World"", in this context sounds like a sweet sexual metaphor between a masculine king and a feminine Earth. Wisely, Barzelay downplays the easy pun in the line ""the Lord is come"" for the weightier and orgasmic physical response: ""Fields and floods, rocks hills and plains repeat the sounding joy!"" When they settle down domestically, many rock artists seem to lose some of their spark, their hard-won happiness diluting the angst that made them so compelling in the first place. But on Bitter Honey, Barzelay thrives on the secret fears that lie beneath the surface of even the most secure relationships, torn by unwanted thoughts of personal freedom and suspicions that warmth and happiness are ultimately hollow and meaningless. ""Love's the most tender illusion,"" he sings on ""Let Us Be Naked"", sounding resigned never to know if that's a good or a bad thing, a beautiful lie or a foolish dupe. That insoluble dilemma makes this modest album surprisingly substantial.","Debut solo album from the Clem Snide leader is modest yet substantial.

Everything All the Time,Band of Horses,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b513d1975652138d8a/1:1/w_160/1a0eb755.jpg,2006-03-19 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1200-everything-all-the-time/,Sub Pop,"""At every occasion, I'm ready for a funeral."" In the year between my father's diagnosis with cancer and his death, I dreaded the telephone. Whenever it rang, I jumped. Picking it up with a trepidant hand, I tried to quickly discern the caller's tone of voice, fearing the worst news. Whether intentionally or not, the line quoted above, from Band of Horses' debut album, Everything All the Time, perfectly evokes that particular anxiety. It's a sad line for any song, but Band of Horses singer Ben Bridwell's delivery isn't mopey or self-absorbed-- there are no intimate acoustic guitars or whispery male vocals accompanying these words. Instead, he belts them over soaring guitars and extroverted chords, all tempered with a stoicism that staves off histrionics. Turning despondency into indie majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for personal projection. More elemental than the lush dream-pop of Bridwell and Mat Brooke's former band Carissa's Wierd (the duo played all the instruments here before fleshing out the band with backing musicians), Band of Horses' sound will be immediately, invitingly familiar to anyone who reads this site regularly. Their guitar-heavy sound and Bridwell's echo-y vocals invite specific comparisons to labelmates the Shins as well as My Morning Jacket, and more general similarities can be noted with forebears such as Neil Young and the Ocean Blue. While apt, these comparisons seem restrictive and reductive, but their limitations can be illuminating. On quieter songs such as ""St. Augustine"", Bridwell recalls Jim James' reverb-heavy vocals, but he lacks the defining regional drawl; as a result, Band of Horses seem placeless. Where the Shins coil their songs tightly to spring out at the choruses, Bridwell and Brooke's tracks sprawl languorously-- more atmospheric than hooky, but nevertheless too structured and targeted to be considered jammy. Band of Horses' alternately lucid and obscure songwriting remains life-size, even as their guitars swell beyond the everyday. Album centerpiece ""The Great Salt Lake"" begins with a jangly guitar that suggests early R.E.M., lying low to the ground during the verses until the chorus takes off. They also successfully work that contrast between earthbound and airborne on ""The Funeral"" and ""Monsters"", with its rickety banjo carving a rough path for a climactic finale. Of course, if all of Everything strove for such catharsis, the repetition of builds and releases would become tedious and cheap. Wisely, Band of Horses show off a much broader dynamic, peppering the album with rangier numbers like ""The First Song"" and the churning, catchy ""Wicked Gil"". ""Weed Party"", the album's most upbeat track, even begins with what sounds like a spontaneous and genially goofy ""yeee-haw!"" Still, every element and track on Everything contributes to the album's wistful, twilit atmosphere, from its first cascading guitar chords to its final rueful strums. And instead of closing with the slow crescendo of ""Monsters"", they go out on a quieter note with ""St. Augustine"", a gently ebbing tune featuring both Horses singing together, Bridwell's higher-pitched voice anchored by Brooke's low whisper. So the album's not as grim as that introductory quotation would imply; the band's downheartedness is always offset by a sense of hope. As Bridwell sings on ""Monsters"", ""If I am lost it's only for a little while."" Though Band of Horses aren't likely to be heralded as trailblazers, they do sound quietly innovative and genuinely refreshing over the course of these 10 sweeping, heart-on-sleeve anthems. Ultimately, the band's most winning trait is its delicate balance of elements-- between gloom and promise, quiet and loud, epic and ordinary, familiar and new, direct and elliptical, artist and listener. Each of these aspects makes the others sound stronger and more complex, making Everything All the Time an album that's easy to get lost in and even easier to love. ","Wedding the elemental, earthworn rock of My Morning Jacket to the atmospheric pop of the Shins or Red House Painters, this debut from Sub Pop signees Band of Horses is immediately, invitingly familiar. But if its roots are recognizable, the music is anything but commonplace.

Jacket Full of Danger,Adam Green,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe8ea9e61561daa7b25/1:1/w_160/aea26148.jpg,2006-03-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3628-jacket-full-of-danger/,Rough Trade,"Shit fuck piss! I thought I could toss Adam Green, erstwhile of early '00s anti-folkers Moldy Peaches, following the stiff shock-value yucks and self-satisfied cabaret smirks of his 2005 full-length Gemstones. But on his latest solo album, Jacket Full of Danger, the New York eccentric at last fully immerses himself in vulgarity-- in the scummy bilge water of language and culture. Like the hapless beer-run guy trapped in ""express"" checkout behind some 69-items-or-more Daddy's girl, I can't help but enjoy perusing the headlines, even if I wouldn't quite take the thing home. See, Green digs trash. Crissakes he once covered ""Kokomo"". So this time douchebag goes all the way with the string section his last album dropped. He frolics in a rancid NashVegas compost heap of rhinestone cowboys and dope-addled wash-outs; indeed, after a Rupert Holmes drum fill, opener ""Pay the Toll"" escapes into magical Glen Campbell bombast. ""How many drugs does it take to find something to do?"" Green croons, a recurring career theme echoed to assier effect in the disappointingly adolescent ""Drugs"". ""Party Line"" serenades a prostitute amid similarly glitzy scenery. Whiskey-period Jim Morrison track ""White Women"" turns Green's former dumbfuck tricks, but it also reprises a tiki-bar backing chant from the truly bizarre ""C Bird"". Hey, trash sells. Occasionally, Green chases the skirt of his fucked-up muse someplace actually revelatory. ""Fellas in umbrellas in the middle of the night/ What you gonna do when the Mennonites bite?"" he sings on ""Novotel"", a dizzy minute-and-a-half organ jaunt that calls out Isaac Asimov's Pete Doherty pastime (hint rhymes with ""rack""). Acoustic closer ""Hairy Women"" hypocritically bemoans the fate of ladies with characteristics widely deemed unattractive: ""I have praise for every fantasy that braves a hairy nipple."" On first single ""Nat King Cole"", Green's brassy vibrato neatly evokes fat aloha Elvis, spewing absurdities before lurching into his name-dropping chorus. John Leguizamo gets a mention, too. Celebrity call-outs are no surprise from the guy who paid ironic homage to mammary icon Jessica Simpson, but here they're finally funny. ""Bob Dylan is a vegetable's wife,"" Green sings with unlikely aptness, like found poetry from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or Weekly World News. The aggressively banal orchestral arrangements and cornball baritone make Jacket Full of Danger something like a rakish Scott Walker for the post-Beck era. Lest you doubt Green's cred, there's also a not-that-innocent Beat Happening cover. Green's lowest notes sometimes recall buddy Julian Casablancas' recent because-I-can barrel-scrapes. What the album's other, lesser songs point out: Green, that stoned motherfucker, possesses a unique patchwork vision of warped mass nostalgia. But he only intermittently gets it all in focus. Oh, the country he's huge in, again? They coined the word ""kitsch"".","On his latest Rough Trade release, the New York eccentric and former Moldy Peach at last fully immerses himself in the scummy bilge water of language and culture.

Music for a French Elevator,The Books,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3455e6ef959693205ef/1:1/w_160/0bf647a2.jpeg,2006-03-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/857-music-for-a-french-elevator/,self-released,"Books guitarist Nick Zammuto has said that early in the band's development he was challenged by a friend to make music that couldn't possibly be used on a film soundtrack. Whether or not it was intentional, the Books have in a sense followed through on this request. By seeding their tracks with voices-- many actually drawn from obscure movies-- the Books have ensured that their music exists as a self-contained world of its own, one that doesn't easily lend itself to reinforcing an unrelated image. Their songs are their own little movies. Even so, the Books continue to take on other sound-related projects in addition to their records. In April 2004 they recorded four short tracks to be used in conjunction with a work created for the French Ministry of Culture; the Books were charged with crafting music for the building's elevators. Giving in to repeated requests for this material, the band compiled the music on a homemade 3"" CD-R, along with some miscellaneous material from their extensive sound library. Ranging from about 30 seconds to almost 90, the four elevator pieces are, though short, prime Books material. Though lighter and quieter, ""Fralite"", through it's layering of guitar and cello, captures the whimsy and ache of longing of ""Tokyo"". The stately ballroom piano of ""Egaberte"", which can be heard as the soundtrack when visiting The Books website, is in a sense the quintessential elevator music, localized by the sampled voices speaking French throughout. ""Liternite"" is a surprisingly complete little piece, with an intro of bass, wooden fish and a singing voice pulled from a folk song building steadily to a small crescendo that fades quickly after its peak. ""It's Musiiiiic!"" captures the phrase from a lounge crooner and loops it. The remaining nine tracks on this 15-minute release are mostly collages, with only hints of instrumentation added throughout. ""Meditation Outtakes"" plucks all occurrences of the word ""meditation"" from a speech and lays them end-to-end, demonstrating the way meaning changes with minute changes in inflection. ""Of the Word God"" uses the same technique with ""god,"" sourcing this time from a woman preacher's sermon. You can follow the story she presents through the emphasis on this single word, beginning quietly and moving steadily toward a histrionic scream. Even though they consist mostly of voices removed from their original context and carefully edited, these odds and ends actually demonstrate rather well one of the things that makes the Books so distinctive: their ear for the musicality of the spoken word.","This self-released 3"" CD-R features four tracks recorded in April 2004 as elevator music for the French Ministry of Culture building, and adds some miscellaneous material from the duo's extensive sound library.

Orphanage,Voices and Organs,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9aa13d19756521398d7/1:1/w_160/9252e674.jpg,2006-03-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8546-orphanage/,Western Vinyl,"Led by singer/performer Per Lindmark, Voices and Organs are a Swedish group of indeterminate membership whose blurred creations are rooted deep in the inexact memories and perceptions of distant childhood. The 18 songs on the group's debut Orphanage were initially conceived as short stories, and each appears to have been assembled directly upon that slim border that separates the impressions of actual past events from those only imagined. And though Voices and Organs' dreamy sound is predominantly centered on electronic instruments and grainy, processed tape effects, the album frequently sounds akin to the hermetic psych-folk of Finnish artists like Islaja or Lau Nau, capable of instantly transporting the listener into its insular, alien landscape. As its title implies, what lyrical action there is on this album centers on the stories of a young boy and girl in a fictitious orphanage. Yet throughout the album, the joint male/female vocals, though sung in English, are typically so buried beneath wisps of gauzy sound that their storylines are rendered virtually undetectable. Since the songs had their origins in prose, none are truly equipped with what could be easily identified as choruses, or in some cases discernable vocal melodies at all. Instead the vocalists' inscrutable croons and whispers move like sleepwalkers through the dimmed halls, their paths guided along by the music's ambiguous contours. Constructed almost entirely without noticeable percussion, Orphanage seems intended to promote a certain immersive stupor. If you are able to fend off its narcotic effects, however, the album soon reveals itself to be packed close with absorbing detail, the songs carefully edited and sequenced to appear as one seamless episode. A scrap of piano on ""Trees Are Bending"" leads almost imperceptibly into ""Staircase, Attic, Window"", its delicate melody continued with strummed guitar, melodica, and gently cascading vocals. ""Through the City"" opens with a brassy fanfare that soon moves into supple dunes of analog synth, while ""Sundays"" has a warm, needle-on-vinyl intimacy that's quickly exchanged for the wobbly guitar distortions of ""Boychild"". And Lindmark and company make their most overtly folk-related gestures on the two editions of the acoustic bedroom hymn ""Idle Words"", their narrative distilled to a series of half-awakened, wordless hums. With their Scandinavian background and their graceful, elliptical flow, Voices and Organs seem to demand comparison to Sigur Rós, but Orphanage reveals none of that group's patient, rigorous crescendos or attention to orchestral scale. By all appearances, Voices and Organs prefer to sculpt their individual chronicles on a more microscopic level, leaving their songs with an appearance as diffuse and ephemeral as a chance burst of geyser steam. All that remains to be seen is if the group intend to further build upon the fragile, ethereal structures of Orphanage, or if their music is by its very nature destined to quietly dissipate into the atmosphere like vapor, leaving behind only its collection of lightly dazed witnesses.","This Swedish group's blurred creations are rooted deep in the inexact memories and perceptions of distant childhood.

We Are Night Sky,deadboy & the Elephantmen,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd2ea9e61561daa731c/1:1/w_160/cc378db0.gif,2006-03-16 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2638-we-are-night-sky/,Fat Possum,"We Are Night Sky starts pretty strong: ""Stop, I'm Already Dead"" is a dread-filled swamp stomp featuring Dax Riggs' southern rock delivery, Kurt Cobain squall, and muddy stop/start guitar riffs, as well as Tessie Brunet's rudimentary-as-primal drumbeats. The duo put their own stamp on the White Stripes two-person set-up, locating a slightly different power in a similarly messy minimalism, and that opener sets up some high expectations for deadboy and the Elephantmen's debut, not least of which is that there would be more than one Elephantman backing deadboy. That tricky moniker aside, Riggs and Brunet thwart those raised expectations with the second track, ""No Rainbow"", a meandering, tune-deficient acoustic number featuring a tacked-on caterwauling coda. The song stalls the momentum out completely, and like a sputtering hot rod, We Are Night Sky takes a while to get revved and roaring again. But even when it's moving, there's always the threat that the album will stall out and leave you stranded. On ""How Long the Night Was"", Riggs and Brunet pound a murky guitar riff into a rousingly anthemic chorus. Too bad it's in service of a song that consists mainly of Riggs repeating the line ""If you were dreaming you know how long the night was."" He's overly fond of such nocturnal motifs-- not really imagery, just empty declarations-- and lyrical repetitions based on blues song structures. But where most blues songs cap that repetition with another line to deepen or offset earlier lines, Riggs simply repeats his lyrics without resolving them. There's a potential power in those repetitions, but typically Riggs' proclamations are clunky and vague where they strive to be meaningful and evocative. On ""Ancient Man"", he sings, ""I envy the night/ For its absence of light,"" but the statement is far too cryptic to be consequential. After a rocky start, the album moves through some severe ups and downs: impressive highs amid oppressive lows. As a general rule, as the tempos pick up, so does the album, but whenever Riggs pulls out his acoustic and slows things down, We Are Night Sky coughs to a stop. ""Blood Music"" careens wildly, as if the brakes and steering have failed, and the thundering ""Kissed by Lightning"" and ""Misadventures of Dope"" are scalding swamp boogies with heavy-metal bluster reminiscent of Riggs's previous band, Acid Bath. Unfortunately, these tracks are interspersed with downtempo numbers like ""Dressed in Smoke"" and ""Evil Friend"" that trail off without much drama. It's not that quieter moments would be unwelcome, but on We Are Night Sky, these songs sound particularly weak, implying that the duo haven't developed much beyond their hard-hitting riffage. With its lo-fi production, ""Break It Off"" has field-recording pretensions, but simply grates. ""Walking Stick"" at least showcases Brunet's ethereal voice, which nicely countervails Riggs' earthy, aggressive vocals, but the song is so whisper-slight that it dissipates like smoke even as you listen. Ultimately, it's enough to make you ditch the hot-rod and walk.","Fat Possum release from another in a line of co-ed, blues-influenced duos.

Axis of Evol,Pink Mountaintops,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18f5e6ef959693201ed/1:1/w_160/6731883d.gif,2006-03-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6565-axis-of-evol/,Jagjaguwar,"Pink Mountaintops is of course the summer home of Steve McBean, who helms the lite-psychedelic-sludge outfit Black Mountain and who oozed Francophilic dread throughout late-90s Canada atop the stark Jerk With a Bomb. Initially, the seven tracks on his new record seem to play like fugitives from disparate orphanages, each with its own ambitions and sense of style. But they are linked by, of all things, an evangelical urgency: McBean self-consciously blends Satan-fearing Louvin Brothers sentiments with the Velvet Underground's narco-messianism and heavy doses of the 1970s California Jesus Movement's rhetoric/vibe. The bible-fondling is a feint, though (I think), an allusive backdrop against which McBean worries about contemporary political turmoil. Take ""Comas"", for example: McBean's catalog is on a pace to out-reference Dan Bejar's, and here he rejects AC/DC's mantra outright: ""No, I'm not headed down a highway to hell."" War-and-peace imagery follows, but the chorus surrenders to la-la scatting. Some message is being telegraphed: the horny first Pink Mountaintops EP never sat around strumming Banhart's guitar, engineering the fingertip-slides as loudly as the vocals. Either we have a new babysitter, or the old one has been mellowed by 24-hour news and feels guilty about his slutty past. During ""Cold Criminals"", a beep, like the ones on old storybook-record combos that signaled a page-turn, re-begins the riff. The bass is Black Mountain funk, and the guitar is VU-slop, but an effect sounds like planes taking off. Is this more than the requisite Smog shout-out (see Callahan's ""Ex-Con"", and note how the last Pink Mountaintops' ""Tourist In Your Town"" seemed to wink at ""I Was A Stranger"")? Is Halliburton or Enron in McBean's sights? Is the refrain, ""Devil got us in his plans,"" a rebuff to fundamentalist conservative broadcaster/prognosticators such as the Van Impes, who cast us (North Americans) as the heroes in an apocalyptic fantasia? ""New Drug Queens"": Okay, the chorus is ""Tell your Mama don't stay out late tonight,"" which seems to be shushing the Scissor Sisters, or appropriating Glenn Danzig's famous maternal taunt. ""Slaves"" follows, and McBean sounds like he's trying to talk PJ Harvey out of hanging out in the desert with that Stone Age guy. It's nine minutes of hurdy-gurdy spiral-tribal hokey-pokey propulsion, maybe the redawn of threat-gospel. ""Plastic Man, You're The Devil"": As if cast in an indie-tastic homage to Trading Places, Mr. Lif the agitprop rapper has recently dropped a nasty sex rhyme, and the formerly smutty Pink Mountaintops have recorded a progressive ballad? McBean is either inserting a comic book character into the Freudian drama between God, Mary, and Jesus, or if he's using plasticity the way Devo did, as shorthand for the high-and-tight corporate/government un-man. By the end of the tune, the speaker's pacifism has waned into vigilante pragmatism. ""Lord Let Us Shine"" is a choir number, but it drops fuzzed-out bar-anthem guitar over minimalist drum-machinery; imagine a Polyphonic Spree clown-carjacked by Andrew WK. Things get all Jason Spaceman by the end (remember that he went stoner-churchy too), and the lyrics cop the Stones for the zillionth time, typecasting them again as the arbiters of the 60s demonic majesty. ""How We Can Get Free"" asks Jesus if he even believes anymore, begging him for a liberating ""holy rage."" Blood spills, and McBean repeats more lines from jukebox classics, but the acoustic plod is undercut by an icy Xiu Xiu synth hit. Listening to the song is not unlike having your neck shaved by a The Deer Hunter-era Christopher Walken in a priest outfit. I surrender: I want to type about Axis of Evol until Armageddon, but my flesh is weak. This EP contains more interesting complications than I am capable of harnessing by deadline; I feel like McBean is going to show up at the Pitchfork office as a reaping angel, and I won't be ready, and there won't be time to repent. What are these songs about partying, warfare, and holiness trying to do? Is McBean envisioning a neu-hippie version of Left Behind? Is he speaking in tongues with his tongue in his cheek? Most importantly, how and why is this piledrivingly unsubtle delivery of bleak Dylanesque cosmology so hott? In his book American Jesus, Stephen Prothero details how one of the ""dangerous directions"" of the Jesus Movement was toward ""Flirty Fishing,"" or using ""sex as a recruiting technique"" for the Lord. Consider me seduced.","New record from one of the other projects of Black Mountain's Steve McBean.

Pirate Radio,The Pretenders,by: Stephen M.

Usually the first disk or two contains everything you really need, and the last disks are full of late-career tracks that are highlights only compared to the songs that were omitted. Whether through the Pretenders' talent or by the compilers' design, Pirate Radio-- which is the band's first multidisk retrospective and a long time coming-- showcases a band that held onto its gritty gift for crafting complex songs with sharp melodic lines and smart(ass) lyrics. There are some duds here, but the high ratio of rockers to clunkers remains remarkably consistent across all four disk, which is no mean feat considering the Pretenders have been in an almost constant state of turnover since their very first album. Seemingly an ideal band for a box set like this, the Pretenders made at least one great album (their self-titled debut), a few good albums, and a couple of releases that are generously described as ""for-fans-only"". However, they were best song by song-- not just singles like ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" or ""Night in My Veins"", but album tracks like ""Thumbelina"" and ""Bad Boys Get Spanked"" as well. Collected together, these 81 songs-- presented in rough chronological order across four disks and complemented with a DVD of mostly lip-synced live appearances-- rarely ever sound dated. Furthermore, listening to them doesn't require any sort of trendy nostalgia for the late 70s or early 80s. Pirate Radio, in other words, proves more than simply artifactual: While even its weakest tracks contribute to its historical/biographical scope, the set proves an imminently listenable, often kick-ass collection. The Pretenders were post-punk chronologically, if not aesthetically. An ex-pat from Akron, singer Chrissie Hynde hung out with the Sex Pistols, scribed for NME, and clerked at Malcolm McLaren's notorious Sex shop. She was also desperate to be ""in a band,"" a need so strong the liner notes suggest it's pathological. So she hooked up with four guys from Hereford and formed the Pretenders just as punk was fizzling out. They fed off punk's visceral energy, but Hynde was too much of a fervent believer in capital-R Rock to buy into its nihilism. Also, while most other post-punk bands were experimenters and tinkerers, she was (and remains) a traditionalist, refining instead of redefining rock. Their modest goal, which they handily achieved, was to be a really good rock band: tight, inventive, aggressive, goofy, gutsy, and-- perhaps most important-- with a particular sound that could be readily identified as the Pretenders. They laid it all out on their self-titled 1979 debut, which includes some of their best songs: the country-inflected ""Kid"", the motorbike beat of ""Tattooed Love Boys"", the inimitable vocals and slangy lyrics on ""Brass in Pocket"", the show-closing ""Mystery Achievement"". People don't buy and comb through every lyric and riff of this album the same way they do Power, Corruption, and Lies or Entertainment!, but it's aged just as gracefully, retaining its original power. Nevertheless, a surprising eclecticism is encoded into the Pretenders' DNA, the byproduct of their transatlantic line-up and Hynde's coming-of-age to American radio. Pirate Radio includes convincing country songs like ""Tequila"", Bo Diddley rumbles like ""Cuban Slide"", shameless balladry like ""I'll Stand By You"", American soul numbers like their cover of ""Thin Line Between Love and Hate"", and blue-eyed soul songs like ""977"" (which borrows its melody from ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?""). They could easily be gaudy and goofy (""The Adultress"") and maudlin (""Birds of Paradise"" or ""I'll Stand By You"", take your pick), but they treat all these styles as if they're all logical bedfellows under the Rock umbrella. Connecting all these disparate stylistic elements is Hynde's singular bravado, a vocal delivery both masculine and feminine, aggressive yet controlled, brash yet vulnerable-- contradictions that serve the song first and her persona second. Her voice has a crystalline quality that arcs tenderly on ""Kid"" and ""2000 Miles"", but she frequently launches into a kind of jive singspeak, rushing through her syllables without losing the meter. She can sell a line as mushy as ""I'm thinking of the fireworks that go off when you smile"" as persuasively as a raunchy line like ""You've got your chest on my back across a new Cadillac-oh yeah."" From the very first track on Pirate Radio through the very last, she maintains a complex and often contradictory front. In this regard, the television and concert clips on the DVD could potentially complement the music and portray another side of Hynde, but most of the material consists of awkward performances in which she either lip-syncs poorly or tries way too hard. Only the mid-80s concert footage of ""Middle of the Road"" hints at her considerable stage presence. Sadly, Hynde is the only constant throughout Pirate Radio's four disks, just as she was the only constant in the Pretenders. Original members Pete Farndon and James Honeyman Scott both OD'd (Farndon after being booted from the band, Scott after a night of pub hopping), and drummer Martin Chambers was fired, then rehired a few years later. Hynde carried on for years under the Pretenders moniker, never going solo; that's less a heroic act that a manifestation of her need to belong to a band, even if it allegedly inspired the hit ""Back on the Chain Gang"", which is reportedly about keeping the band together after Scott died. We should all be so lucky to have a memorial as lovely as Hynde's ""oh-oh-woa-whoa-whoa"" that punctuates each line of the verse. So Pirate Radio naturally rises and falls with her whims, and while it may have been tighter with three instead of four disks, the set shows an artist who helped to create and sustained a sound that has made the Pretenders stand out among nearly thirty years' worth of bands. The audience may have shrunk, but the songs remain the same.","Four-disc, one-DVD set celebrates the rich history of the famed post-punk band.

The Black Dove,Christian Kiefer,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc565e6ef95969322e0c/1:1/w_160/b02e947e.jpg,2006-03-16 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4609-the-black-dove/,Tompkins Square,"To this point in their respective careers, British folk singer Sharron Kraus and Californian performer/composer Christian Kiefer have been working in neighboring channels of traditional folk and country. So it comes as little surprise to hear the duo's easy compatibility on their first joint effort The Black Dove. The album comfortably fits Kraus' distinctive, Oxford-bred vocals into settings of refracted Americana that recall such acts as Califone or Iron & Wine, and proves to be that rare collaboration that is equally beneficial to each of its participants. With a voice as clear and bracing as a stream of pure-grain spirits, Kraus' work on her previous solo albums echoes that of singers like Shirley Collins, Karen Dalton, or Sandy Denny, her songs steeped in the sturdiest British and Appalachian balladic tradition. Kiefer, meanwhile, has made more varied, experimental use of traditional music, ranging from his 2002 minimalist Dust Bowl epic Exodust to the stilted western dioramas of 2003's Medicine Show. Writing together via e-mail, the two eventually were able to craft The Black Dove in a week of feverish creation. As with any such new partnership, the album is not without its tentative moments, but together these two manage to highlight several captivating, previously unforeseen aspects in one another's music. Outfitted with a cache of guitars, banjos, pump organs, and strings, Kiefer provides the arrangements to these songs with unsettling, sinister cross-currents that Kraus' earlier albums have only whispered at. A Ph.D student in American literature at UC-Davis, Kiefer has shown a preference in his work for the sustained, libretto-like narrative. And The Black Dove is no exception, as these 15 tracks are loosely united around the fragmented account of an obsessive, doomed love affair that extends to the grave and beyond. Needless to say, the album's themes of lost love and spiritual estrangement are mother's milk for an accomplished balladeer like Kraus, and such songs as the Dock Boggs-like ramble ""Missing"" or the hymn-paced ""The Blackest Crow"" sound as ageless and irreducible as a column of hickory smoke. Though The Black Dove opens with a deceptively tranquil prelude of flute and guitar, it isn't long before the album begins its grim, fatalistic cycle. ""On the Chase"" finds Kraus casting heart-shaped messages to the four winds, the narrator's romantic desire turning to bleak desperation over an atmospheric backwoods creak akin to Tom Waits' Bone Machine. This haunted rusticism continually peeks through the fissures of tracks like the conflicted ""Letting Go, Holding On"" and ""A Snake & a Lion"", before the tale's arc comes to an electrifying crescendo on the self-explanatory ""Mourning,"" a spirited dirge laced with a furious bolt of Bad Seeds/ Dirty Three violin. Although Kiefer is certainly a capable vocalist in his own right, the album's energy flags noticeably when he takes the microphone on ""Cold Blue Room"" or ""Dearest"", tracks that venture unpleasantly close to alt-country convention. Instead The Black Dove is best served when he sticks to edging Kraus' forceful voice with refined shade and color, or when he helps deliver such crucial instrumental interludes as the exquisite woodwind figures of ""The Rocks"", upon which the album's subjects take their final bow. Fortunately for all involved, Kiefer and Kraus survive The Black Dove in much better shape than the ill-fated lovers of their narrative, leaving the listener only to hope that this album signals the beginning of a long and mutually rewarding musical partnership.","Solid collaboration between the British folk singer and Californian performer/composer.

My Dark Places,Television Personalities,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab6213d1975652139bc9/1:1/w_160/3b083bc7.jpg,2006-03-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8975-my-dark-places/,Domino,"Dan Treacy and the Television Personalities have a big legacy-- a spot on the CV as godfathers of do-it-yourself pop, and a terrific 1980s back catalog of witty, eccentric new-wave and indie. Listening to Treacy's signature puppy/schoolboy voice-- the most vulnerable voice in the world-- and clocking the humor and whimsy scattered across those records, you'd hardly expect the guy to turn out a rock-star casualty; he's a twee-pop touchstone, not a sweaty romantic. But drug problems (and mental ones) don't much care for those distinctions. By the 90s, Treacy was missing and presumed dead; when he turned up this decade, it was while doing time on an English prison boat. When he was released, and told his friends he'd been writing songs all along, a lot of machinery sprang into motion to make this album possible-- from fans raising cash for studio time to the Brit rock label Domino signing the Television Personalities to its roster. Their press release calls the band ""the original Babyshambles,"" but this particular wreck is a lot more human than stylish. The first track we heard from this turned out to be perfect. The re-recorded version on the album is titled ""I Hope You're Happy Now"", and it's exactly the kind of song Treacy's always shined on-- languid, unassuming, unguarded, shambling-along guitar-pop, recorded in the kind of warm, naturalistic way not much heard these days. It was also perfectly placed in the Treacy story: The original title was ""I Hope He's Everything You Wanted Me to Be"", and the sense of fatigue, resignation, and disappointment in his vocals was awfully easy to connect with. Everyone must have been hoping that prison time had netted a whole record's worth of songs like this-- well-crafted, forlorn, and with a whole lot of very serious things to say, an unpremeditated ""real deal"" collection of intensely human stuff. A whole lot of people write a whole lot of earnest songs on guitars; sometimes it's nice to hear some that feel like one of them is genuinely struggling to express something honest. But not quite. My Dark Places doesn't just uncover shadowy corners in its subject matter-- it's also musically unkempt, stumbling along and veering off in directions most bands wouldn't even be comfortable using as B-sides or jokes. ""All the Young Children on Crack"" consists mostly of a spare drumbeat repeating while Treacy sings the title-- interwoven with some fumbling handclaps and acoustic guitar wanders. ""Ex-Girlfriend Club"" is actively creepy, with Treacy speaking as the club's tour guide (""Help yourself to the salad bar"") before singing bits of ""Uptown Top Ranking"", running in an odd sampled break, and talking about Puff Daddy over shapeless piano lines. Some tracks seem improvised, thrown-together, Treacy half-singing off a lyric sheet as the instruments around him try to find something interesting to do. Fans-only references abound: paisley shirts and miniskirts, ""paradise is for the blessed,"" etc. Even the best songs aren't prime-time performances-- they're shambling in a worrying way, as if they only just barely managed to get themselves recorded at all. When the songs are good, though, that quality is what provides a lot of the charm-- which has often been the way with this band. And a lot of these tracks turn out to be incredible. ""She Can Stop Traffic"" captures lots of things: the raw romantic enthusiasm of this act; the boyish, starry-eyed quality that comes out when the band ""rocks""; and the wit and the pain both, which Treacy combines over the ending fade. (""She can stop traffic,"" he sings, ""and she's mine. Or she was."") On tracks like ""Dream the Sweetest Dreams"", it's just the sound of the act that makes this so great-- these recordings aren't ""lo-fi,"" but they're unadorned, in-the-room, full of a wide-open warmth, a slack human quality, and voices that leave them feeling spectacularly intimate. Considering that you get the same feeling from the lyrics, it's easy to see how the band's fans will be taken with this even in the moments where it's close to being a musical disaster: You forgive those things the way you might with your best friend's band. And as you listen more, a lot more of the record reveals itself as not so disastrous at all. This is a strange kind of ""difficult"" pop, where songs that first seem hard to listen to gradually take shape and acquire potent emotional effects. On a few of these songs-- where Treacy plays his songs on piano, maybe accompanying his voice with a melodica-- that's exactly what's on offer: Whatever the quality of the music and the performance, there's an incredible amount of emotion that winds up coming through. (See ""There's No Beautiful Way to Say Goodbye"".) And whether Treacy's music is working or not, the one thing he always has working for him is the uniqueness of his approach; now more than ever, this sounds like pretty much nothing else, and in a way that's entirely unpremeditated. The most vulnerable voice in the world makes for the most vulnerable album in the world, and it's largely a train wreck-- but there are very good reasons to hope that Treacy stays well and keeps at it.","An unexpected comeback from the legendary indie pop band fronted by Dan Treacy.

Hello,The Capes,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1325e6ef95969320125/1:1/w_160/754e756a.jpg,2006-03-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1829-hello/,Hard Soul,"What's great about the Capes' debut album is the commanding grip they have on their sound. Just the opening notes of ""Mexican Broads"" set the tone for Hello: a moseying bass line, a few cute Casio keyboard squiggles that hover like gnats in summer, then some cutting chords from impatient guitars. Singer Kris Barratt delivers an irreverent and sing-songy line like he's really pleased with himself to be British, adding a level of charm and guile to a familiar 90s sound. You may read Beach Boys comparisons elsewhere, but it sounds a whole lot like later Blur, right down to the falsetto backing vocals in ""Broads"" and later ""Comet Tails"". What's strange is that, even with all these tools in their arsenal, few of the songs on Hello deliver on the promise of their parts. The band switches from jagged angst to self-satisfied giggles with ease, and tracks like ""First Base"" wield on the keyboards just as aggressively as guitars, showing patent disregard for subtlety. But amidst all the bubbly enthusiasm, slacker charm, and layered ""la-la-la's,"" good ideas get lost in the jumble. There's something jarring and graceless about the transitions in ""Supergirls"" or ""Shinjuku 5"", on which several competent hooks are sewn together like patchwork without any single one leaving an impression. By the time one gets to ""Carly"", the melodies fired away at automatic clip, it starts to feel workmanlike. Perhaps it's just too much of a good thing. It sounds brilliant while it's playing, but damned if I can remember one tune from the album the moment it's over. Songs like ""Regional Heats"", from their debut EP Taste, were irresistibly catchy; ""Mexican Broads"" might be the only track on Hello that lands a hook. There are some surprises towards the album's latter half, when the energy lags and the boys get introspective. The sugary Blur/Beulah mix of ""Comet Tails"" sounds both proud and bruised at once. ""Tightly Wound"" flirts with surf rock and recalls the Offspring's ""Come Out and Play"" a little too closely, but ""Stately Homes"" is an unpretentious and unadorned strum-happy sing-along. Closing track ""Sun Roof"" sounds downright ethereal, even. These few moments are cracks in the band's joyous but rote veneer. For now, call Hello a fine stick of gum and the Capes a band to keep an eye on, because they're certainly capable of more.","Debut album from an indie rock band that already has a commanding grip on its sound.

Codex Teenage Premonition,Fire Engines,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beccc0084474cd0c2f39/1:1/w_160/127a5cd4.jpg,2006-03-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3361-codex-teenage-premonition/,Domino,"The past few years have seen the story of the post-punk era continually rewritten, as increasing numbers of bands are delivered from obscurity into the hands of reissue-hungry hipsters. With the release of last year's Codex Teenage Premonition, add Scotland's Fire Engines to the list of post-punk acts basking in the glow of renewed interest. Formed in 1979, the Fire Engines counted Josef K and Orange Juice among their domestic contemporaries, but their penchant for furious noise and repetition placed them closer to England's Swell Maps or even American No Wave than the Postcard sound. Neither their debut LP, Lubricate Your Living Room, nor the comprehensive compilation of their studio output, Fond, have been in print for more than a decade, so the band's legacy seemed destined to be forgotten. But then in 2004, Franz Ferdinand-- who clearly learned a thing or two about angular guitar riffs and self-deprecating lyrics from the Fire Engines-- tapped the band to open for them on tour. The pairing resulted in a split 7"" in which Franz Ferdinand covered the Engines' first single, ""Get Up and Use Me"", while the reunited Fire Engines turned in a deranged rendition of Franz Ferdinand's ""Jacqueline"". At times unrecognizable, the Engines' version threatens to totally fall apart, mocking the airtight performance of the original with a haphazard looseness. Comprised of live performances (some of which were recorded by fans), Codex Teenage Premonition would be entirely superfluous were it not for the fact that the rest of the band's catalogue remains out of print. The band is captured in blisteringly raw form, but without studio polish or proper mixing, we get an extreme picture of the mechanics of the band: fat bass grooves; thin, piercingly hot guitar stabs; and David Henderson's nasal yelps. The sound quality is frustratingly poor throughout, which makes the three bonus tracks particularly redemptive. In addition to ""Jacqueline"", the disc includes two strong tracks taken from a 1981 Peel Session. ""Discord"", which unnecessarily appears three times on the album, is a hypnotically rhythmic workout that boasts a simple, but circuitously fluid bass line and some James White-esque skronk. ""Candyskin"" is the Fire Engines' lone bid for pop stardom, plodding along with the cocksure swagger of the Voidoids and icing the cake with a giddy coda of la la la's. Codex Teenage Premonition is hardly a definitive introduction. But armed with some ragged snapshots of the band live and two excellent Peel outtakes (which will soon be released as a 7"" single), it still makes a strong case for the Fire Engines' inclusion in the periphery of the ever-expanding post-punk canon. But it will take some long overdue reissues of their studio output to elevate them above also-rans.","Oddly compiled record draws on the Scottish post-punk band's live recordings and sessions.

Murmurs,Caroline,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a751c0084474cd0c0b6d/1:1/w_160/161ddf71.jpg,2006-03-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1830-murmurs/,Temporary Residence,"Murmurs, the debut full-length from L.A.-by-way-of-Okinawa pop enchantress Caroline (last name Lufkin), follows on the heels of her 2005 single ""Where's My Love"", a beautiful experiment in minimalist pop arrangements and angelic vocals. Murmurs delivers on the promise shown in that single, utilizing an array of acoustic and electric instruments to create dreamy, delicate textures as a backdrop for her lilting voice. The result is a blend of ethereal pop and ambient IDM that creates an elegant soundscape of atmosphere and mood. The disc opens with quiet, contemplative horns reminiscent of something Gene Wilder would've sung over in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. As Caroline's voice glides in, she reminisces about a childhood love, and though muted keys and a low, thumping beat carry the tune, it's the horns that define the nostalgic mood. ""Pink & Black"" introduces a more dynamic rhythm, with a glitchy beat, tinkling piano, and layered vocal harmonies. ""Where's My Love"" appears here again, retaining all of its gentle beauty. Though it sounds like a lullaby, the vocals are at once sad and hopeful, the inner thoughts of a heart longing to find love. ""Everylittlething"" follows, and contains some of this disc's darker moments. Driving, distorted synths are almost enough to push the track into dance territory, but the quiet mood and soft refrain keep one foot grounded in the same realm as Caroline's more subtle moments. On ""All I Need"", she shows off her vocal range, complimenting her own lines with deeper, darker words and phrases. Carolie's ability to sneak in unexpected splashes of different sounds-- whether a moment of anger in an otherwise serene song, or a moment of hope in an otherwise sad tune-- gives Murmurs its strength. Many of the album's best moments are not immediate but take multiple listens to make themselves known. Therefore, it's not just the subtle beauty in her voice that makes Caroline unique, but also her gift for using quiet ambience as a key element in these intricate, layered arrangements.","L.A.-by-way-of-Okinawa pop enchantress Caroline (last name Lufkin) follows on the heels of her 2005 single ""Where's My Love"".

Oh Vanille/Ova Nil / Countless Times,Diane Cluck,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a752b1335d7bf1699020/1:1/w_160/2d0d5091.jpg,2006-03-15 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11709-oh-vanilleova-nil-countless-times/,Important,"Diane Cluck is the proverbial birthed-in-urban-woods fawn (or, as one of her songs, says ""Wild Deer at Dawn""): an ""outsider artist."" Piano lessons at seven (denaturing her wide-eyed talents); young-prodigy recital train-wrecks; circa 2003, the Dorland Mountain Arts Colony where she recorded half of Oh Vanille/Ova Nil was burned, and her own personal room, destroyed. Important pushed for two years just to get that first commercial release from her. Normalcy, or the burn of, well, everyday life: mythmaking, 2003-2006. She doesn't care what you think, as the backstory says; whatever problem you have, that problem is yours. Cynics will touch on the Pennsylvania Academy of Music classical training, her Devendra Banhart endorsement (""I'm so happy to be alive at the same time she is because I get to see her perform""), the Golden Apples of the Sun inclusion, AntiFolk affiliation, or the affirming two-going-on-three real record releases, as evidence of some worldly self-consciousness. But I do not doubt she means exactly what she says. Why the smoke and story? Perhaps because her work is so mono-expressive, made from tuneful-but-not-tunes guitar strums, and her voice-- deeper and emotional-rangier than fellow scenester Marissa Nadler's, way less weird than Joanna Newsom's or, say, Genevieve Elverum's-- is doing all the thought and work. Listen to her, actually, according to an old interview: ""I believe anyone can write a good song if they would write exactly what they're thinking."" So, Oh Vanille/Ova Nile and Countless Times; let's dispense with maturity or growth comparisons between these two 2005 releases; literalism doesn't age. ""Easy to Be Around"", Oh Vanille's centerpiece quarter-love song, does double-up on the vocals (harmonies too) but floats in on the casual hook-- no points for guessing-- ""You're easy to be around."" She might have charmed you, or sex-jammed you (""Have I told you how I like to see/ A man submit to ecstasy?"" off ""Half A Million Miles From Home""), but the glow won't last: You don't even know her, that's gonna be problem over time, plus (dudes) I'm pretty sure she's married. I don't know...Dylan didn't do protest songs either. But nor did he do heart-to-hearts. Cluck's clanging guitar non-progressions on ""Sandy Ree"" harmonize with her voice, which harmonizes with, well, another track of her voice. Beautiful, but even her two-way street is hermetic. David Marchese track-reviewed/cast-into-Starbucks ""Your Million Sweetness"" as audience-performer disconnect (""Maybe I'm the wrong demographic; maybe she is too""); what he got at, I think, is the eerie fact there is no audience in Cluck's modes at all. Jandek's inward look (to name another hyper-loner), at least, was one-and-done: Cluck's second-to-last Countless Times song is, take one, ""My Teacher Died/Countless Times"", and last song, take two, ""My Teacher Died"". Predictability's a real bitch. Is this because, again, she doesn't care, or because she's an (A)rtist, or is it both? Countless Times warbles ""Just As I Should Be"" into this kind of take-it-either-way insouciance: ""I'm not who you think I am. I'm not so good, I'm not so bad. I'm just as I should be."" At parties, testimonials tend to make me finish my drink that much quicker; Cluck says ""All I Bring You Is Love"" but I doubt the pronouns. Her woods-mourning ""Sylvania"" (which seems to resent that William Penn dared to name Pennsylvania as he did, e.g. ""How dare he lay his name upon that tract of land?"") is so fucking strange and understated (not lyrically, but)-- why always the otherwise hard sell?","Ahead of her forthcoming new release, we catch up with the folk singer's two previous albums.

Showtunes,Stephin Merritt,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43eea9e61561daa80e1/1:1/w_160/d7cbf3ad.jpg,2006-03-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5240-showtunes/,Nonesuch,"Truth be told, I more or less gave up on musical theater when Lola gave me a concussion during a 5th grade production of Damn Yankees. After regaining consciousness in the nurse's office, I decided that musical theater was too stylized, too rigid, and too corny to justify such physical hazards. Years later, prejudices still intact, I first discovered the music of the Magnetic Fields, right around the release of their hugely successful 3xCD 69 Love Songs. Not since that fateful grade school play had I fallen so hard so fast. Aside from being artful, clever, and stylistically diverse, 69 Love Songs managed to be profoundly moving without falling back on dour poet-auteur poses. Soon, I found myself singing along in a voice I hadn't used for a long time; clearly, I had made the kind of error in judgment that only comes of blunt head trauma. While Showtunes is technically Magnetic Fields frontman Stephin Merritt's first time writing music for the stage, his work has always drawn extensively from musical theater, both in style and in concept. 69 Love Songs was originally conceived as a stage play, and probably warranted a producer credit for Merritt; aside from writing and arranging the album, Merritt cast a number of extremely talented singers to perform several of his songs. Showtunes, a collection of 25 songs written by Merritt for three plays directed by Chen Shi-Zheng, features several of the same vocalists Merritt recruited for 69 Love Songs, and the strongest melodies Merritt has penned since that album's release. Showtunes is an oddly sequenced collection, jumping between songs from the three Merritt-Shi-Zheng collaborations. As such, it is extremely difficult to discern how Merritt's songs fit within the broader narratives of these three plays; I can only assume that the emphasis here is meant to be placed squarely on the songs themselves. As is to be expected, Merritt's arrangements are impeccable, making excellent use of traditional Chinese instruments as well as marimba, steel drum, and ukulele. That said, I'm not entirely convinced that this is the best way to present these songs; the live-sounding recordings don't always bring out the full force of the material, and create a sense of continuity that is only undercut by the album's sequencing. Merritt's contributions to the two narrative plays adapted by Shi-Zheng prove to be the strongest songs on Showtunes. The two-part ""Shall We Sing a Duet?"" from Peach Blossom Fan is my personal favorite. Merritt's word choice is playful and precise, clever in its rhymes and syntax but ruthlessly effective in the story and emotions conveyed. Progressing from simple alternating verses to a serpentine round structure to a stunning lone verse sung in harmony, ""Shall We Sing a Duet?"" tells a story through its words, its melody, and its form. Vocalist Shirley Simms absolutely nails her verses, offering probably the best vocal performance on Showtunes. ""Sounds Expensive"", excellently performed by David Patrick Kelly, narrates the tragicomic romantic history of an emerald ring, Kelly hitting every dramatic pause with perfect aplomb. Selections from My Life as a Fairy Tale, a non-narrative stage adaptation of the works of Hans Christian Andersen, prove more uneven. ""The Top and the Ball"" and ""Auntie Toothache"" both charmingly narrate conflicts between inanimate objects, the latter unexpectedly segueing into a terrifying tale of dentistry-themed torture. There are a few clunkers, though; ""The Little Hebrew Girl"", ""The Ugly Little Duck"", and ""The Little Maiden of the Sea"" are awkward and overlong. Given that My Life as a Fairy Tale is a series of vignettes, the comparative length of these songs makes sense, but it's disappointing that Merritt didn't do more with such rich source material. In the wake of 69 Love Songs, Merritt appeared consistently irked by questions of which songs were autobiographical, and rightfully so. One of Merritt's greatest strengths is his ability to write coherent and compelling voices into his songs, no autobiographical justification required. I'm a bit disappointed that Showtunes isn't better suited to showcase this particular strength, but the songs themselves are nothing to scoff at. Though these songs are a bit more stage-y than the bulk of Merritt's work, the difference is one of degree, not character. In a sense, Merritt has always been writing showtunes; only now, there are shows that go with them.","Magnetic Fields leader presents an oddly sequenced collection that jumps between songs from his three musical theater collaborations with director Chen Shi-Zheng.

Flat-Pack Philosophy,Buzzcocks,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4145e6ef959693207b6/1:1/w_160/c55b606e.jpg,2006-03-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1053-flat-pack-philosophy/,Cooking Vinyl,"Maybe you don't need to hear another three-chord rhumba about conspicuous consumption. Perhaps you're left lacking by the prospect of hearing 50-year-old men plugging in their amplifiers to compare affairs of the heart to assembling an Ikea Robin media shelf. Or maybe you already own the Buzzcocks' Singles Going Steady and don't think there's any point seeing what the minds behind evergreen gems like ""What Do I Get?"" or ""Everybody's Happy Nowadays"" are capable of in the 21st century. It's a shame, then, that you won't hear how good they sound on Flat-Pack Philosophy. Yes, the Buzzcocks are doing what they've always done-- writing raucous pop songs-- but there's something to be said for honing and plying one's craft. If anyone's earned the right to beat this dead horse into sniffing glue, it's the firm of Shelley & Diggle, and they beat it like nobody's business. Flat-Pack Philosophy, the group's seventh full-length, squeezes 14 tunes into just 36 minutes, many of which could give even some Steady moments a run for the filthy lucre. Hyperbole, sure, but it's hard to argue when the breathless chorus of ""Wish I Never Loved You"" is rattling between your ears long after the song is finished. That track, emblematic of Pete Shelley's undying hard-luck romanticism, is followed by Steve Diggle's shining moment on this album, ""Sell You Everything"". Even if the track's message falls a bit flat (see one song title), the music-- all crashing drums and revved-up guitar-- gives it the anthemic punch it requires. The album peaks early with the title track (the one about Ikea) and the aforementioned one-two punch. There's still plenty to enjoy on the back end, though. In fact, the only truly sour track is ""Sound of a Gun"", Diggle's attempt to add some gruff toughness to the Buzzcocks' zippy veneer; the group is at its best these days when melding a youthful exuberance with time-worn maturity. A potentially dreadful track like ""Credit""-- another ""woe is the financial state of the world"" polemic, complete with voices sampled from an automated supermarket checkout kiosk and oh-so-topical complaints about cell phones and junk mail-- is saved by Shelley's wistful chorus (""Credit/ In love with the never never/ Wish I could get something I really need""). While the more socially aware songs come off somewhat out of touch (cell phones? really?), life experience can only help when you're writing pop songs about love. Musically, the breezy gait of ""I Don't Exist"" peacefully co-exists with the more emphatic rock tones of ""Soul Survivor"", and the strength of the music behind these tracks rescues them from any glaring lyrical skidmarks. Conversely, close listens to otherwise enjoyable tunes like ""Between Heaven & Hell"" and ""God, What Have I Done"" might kill one's buzz. Still, most rough patches are smoothed over by the album's overall consistency. Perhaps the notion of a rock band-- let alone a punk rock band-- punching the very same clock they spit at 30 years ago seems distasteful. I say, if someone's good at what they do, and they enjoy what they're doing, punch away.","Latest record of new material from the firm of Shelley & Diggle finds the punk veterans still trading in both effortless hooks and hard-luck romanticism.

Depending on what you've been listening to the past 10 years, this will either lead you to start playing this kind of music, send you digging into the crates for your old Locust records, or both. With some alcohol and jaded friends around, you could play battle of the ""celebrity"" hardcore bands, and pit Some Girls (The Locust, Unbroken) against Das Oath (Charles Bronson, Coalition Records) or Limp Wrist (Los Crudos, Kill The Man Who Questions): I have played this game, and Limp Wrist always wins. Here's the thing: dudes want to grow up. Come your late-20s, the adoration of a sea of kids with Crudos back-patches and spock-rocked hair means nil. For scene vets like Some Girls, there's been an ex-band tag on every flyer they've graced: The band members own labels (bassist Justin Pearson's Three One G), maybe own their own houses, and sport fake moustaches (all of them). No wonder they're done with childish things like hooks and being nice to kids at shows. In punk parlance, we call this the Public Image Ltd. Corollary, and discerning listeners will notice ""Religion II"" sitting squarely at track 10; ""discerning"" because vocalist Wes Eisold's still got something caught in his throat, and the pace only falls off one or two tics, though the chorus is can't miss: ""THIS IS RELIGION."" As metaphor, it's a pretty explicit one: They're doing the maturity thing, but still doing it loudly.

Heaven's Pregnant Teens is not a favorite song record-- Some Girls trade in sonic aesthetics not moments-- plus the lyrics are too scattered to grab and the songs are too short to bother memorizing.

Other People's Lives,Ray Davies,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd413d197565213b19b/1:1/w_160/39ae68c0.jpg,2006-03-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2640-other-peoples-lives/,V2,"The well-respected Englishman of 1960s pop has spent much of his recent years in a place he once called ""the land of the ice cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West."" With air travel in disarray after 9/11, Ray Davies took his stranded American tour on the anywhere American road. During some of the recording of Other People's Lives, improbably the ex-Kink's first proper solo album-- his 1985 soundtrack LP Return to Waterloo and VH1-inspiring 1998 one-man-show The Storyteller each included previously released material-- he lived in New Orleans. The resulting record cleverly mires Davies' observational English cynicism in the turbid bayou of organ-flecked rocking-chair rock and the American confessional singer-songwriter convention. Now age 62, Davies shares the mortality obsession heard in the latter work of similarly graying singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, and the late Johnny Cash. At its best, Other People's Lives hints that Davies' sunset years may not, contra ""Waterloo"", be paradise, as on scratchy-throated shitstorm wake ""After the Fall"", scalding breakup/suicide ballad ""All She Wrote"", and soulful, incongruously lonely hidden track ""Thanksgiving Day"", also the lead single. As with Morrissey-- the Oscar Wilde to Davies' less flamboyantly uppercrust-crumbling George Bernard Shaw-- Davies' enduring voice and wordplay belie their faceless session backing, here primarily acoustic guitar jangle and past-date swamp-rock smolder. The moaning feedback and bass throb of importunate opener ""Things Are Gonna Change"" find their analogue on the title track of Moz's 1997 Maladjusted. Yet at times Davies matures backward, trading the Kinks' tergiversating sophistication for rash generalization. Yup, he's gone native in curmudgeon country. Davies rails against the ""continual quest for the fountain youth"" in ""Run Away From Time"", lambastes dedicated followers of fashion in ""Stand Up Comic"", and complains about that perpetual foe of fogeys and famous dudes alike, the Fourth Estate, on the cliché-mongering title track-- ""Can't believe what I just read/ Excuse me, I just vomited."" Stoned wailer ""The Getaway (Lonesome Train)"" alludes to ""Sunny Afternoon"", Big Easy poverty shockah ""The Tourist"" namedrops ""La Vida Loca"", but both staid productions could benefit from brother Dave's sibling-rival guitar crunch. Other People's Lives is not without its ostensible character songs, which nonetheless suggest the title may be a cunning misnomer. The Village Green music hall of ""Next Door Neighbor"" purports to tell of Joneses, Smiths, and Browns, but published interviews indicate the song's events-- running off with an Essex blonde, smashing a TV through a window-- happened instead to our humble narrator. Similarly, the evocative ""Creatures of Little Faith"" adopts a biblical scope for its title and refrain, but depicts petty relationship jealousy with the detail of someone who's stared into its lurid green eyes. Where many singer/songwriters manipulate the first-person specific to convey a false sense of intimacy, Davies uses the third person and generality to distance his songs from their presumed subjects-- and thus imbues them with particularly true-ringing verisimilitude, which by the way tastes just like cherry cola.","First proper solo album from the Kinks legend finds him flirting with confessional singer-songwriter material and tapping into the sounds of the Southern U.S.

Rock & Roll Is Dead,Hellacopters,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0a5abf31b7dc71564c9/1:1/w_160/f3649669.jpg,2006-03-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3810-rock-roll-is-dead/,Liquor & Poker,"The rock and roll dream hasn't exactly met expectations for Sweden's Hellacopters, although that doesn't stop them from proclaiming rock defunct in the title of their 10th album. But how's this for sad irony-- back when everyone was lamenting grunge or lionizing indie slacker rock, these guys had the chutzpah to reintroduce 70s AOR. Now the Darkness-led cadre of retro-revivers receive the accolades for their supposed trailblazing, though in all fairness, Hellacopters lack more than just opportunistic timing in their Sisyphusian task to co-opt arena rock to stardom. Armed with the unflagging, soaring vocals of Nicke Andersson and a willingness to cram a half-dozen virile riffs into one cramped downbeat, the band smugly recaptures their desired aesthetic and too often quits there. Rock & Roll only confirms this already steadfast claim, showing little to no evolution in the band's material save for perhaps a slightly larger ratio of slowed-down, fake Allman Brothers songs to cocksure rockers. If you're a lock-and-load, full-throttle rock fan though, this album's got your order. Masturbatory guitar solos, cowbells, the same damn bridge to every song-- check your highfalutin songwriting at the door, son, this ain't thinkin' man's music. Of course, we all need to numb our minds sometimes, and standout tracks (in a liberal sense of the term) ""Monkeyboy"" and ""Everything's on TV"" do that trick nicely. The former notches most of the hooks on an otherwise barren album, almost poppy enough to resemble GBV at their most muscular but instead settling for mediocre Springsteen mimicry. A few eons devolved, ""Everything's on TV"" flashes a sanctimonious sneer at prodigal viewers (""I have a TV screen of some 32 inches/ TV dinner and an easy chair"") and resounds about as strongly as the line ""Well I burned all my books/ On my ass I sit and look"". Unfortunately, more than a decade of fist-pumping hasn't garnered much tooth for the band. Opener ""Before the Fall"" sounds as over-the-top plastic as Marty McFly's rendition of ""Johnny B. Goode"" in Back to the Future while ""soulful"" americana ballads like ""Leave It Alone"" are on a Black Crowes level. The precarious divide in revivalist rock today is almost residual of Hellacopters' on/off material. For every Darkness or Hives, we get 10 Jets, and the 'copters canon uncannily reflects this. At this point, I'm convinced the band's trapped in some sort of horrible Groundhog Day-like time trap, churning out the same fodder until 20 albums later maybe, just maybe, they'll reach the year 1977.","One of the forerunners of Darkness/Ark-like 70s rock revivalism returns with their 10th album.

Witch,Witch,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aabb9d034d5c69bf3ed3/1:1/w_160/6cc21bd0.jpg,2006-03-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8808-witch/,Tee Pee,"Forget the dog, kids: 2006 is ostensibly the year of the Mascis. Not only are Dinosaur Jr. back for reunion tours and catalog reissuing, but my favorite wah-loving stoner is revisiting his Deep Wound and Upsidedown Cross days on the side, drumming for doom quartet Witch. Mascis handled Dinosaur's thunder toms when Murph wasn't around (see Green Mind), but in Witch, it's his singular role: no blistering solos or perfect ""Freak Scene"" poetry, just airtight rolls and bass-drum thuds. Spanning the psych-metal/folk divide, two of Witch's members also play in the airy Vermont octet Feathers, perhaps known best as the backup crew on Devendra Banhart's anti-war song, ""Heard Somebody Say"" (although their pleasant forthcoming full-length on Gnomonsong should change that). Here, singer/guitarist Kyle Thomas and guitarist Asa Irons follow the footsteps of folk-rock genre-hoppers like Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny, ably increasing the volume and peeling the tie-dye from the walls. Fans of the legendary SST doom-metal band Saint Vitus will likely find this stuff to be fun, if hardly original. Just don't confuse them with Swedish Pentagram lovers Witchcraft. Actually, okay, confuse them if you want: There are plenty of similarities in the rollicking instrumentation and occult lyricism. The 1970s-style metal cross-referencing would make for a smoking double bill, but Witch inhales more Zeppelin with its Sabbath. Also, Witch's Thomas sounds nothing like Witchcraft vocalist/guitarist Magnus Pelander; instead, he warbles like Jason Simon of Dead Meadow or, oddly enough, the Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider. But whatever the proper analogue or crib sheet-- and regardless of the starpower Mascis brings to the proceedings-- the Feathers boys are the stars of Witch: The album's best moments result from the torrid dual guitar solos, the well-textured feedback, and how the heavy atmosphere contrasts with Thomas' sweetly nasal howl. And that howl is fantastic, especially when Witch aims for epic extrapolations as on the mountainous ""Black Saint"". He also contributes a supernatural spark to epic opener ""Seer"" (those riffs!) and the rising/falling ""Rip Van Winkle"", which should take 10 years off any self-respecting banger's lifespan. (It is sorta strange, though, that this Dead Meadow-sounding dude is from Feathers and Dead Meadow's newest album was called Feathers. Are they sharing the incense and blacklights or what?) Renaissance Faire love song ""Isadora"" provides a pace change with dramatic cymbal washes/crashes and acoustic starlings, but the more expansive stuff works best: ""Soul of Fire""'s boogie, for example, is less appealing than rifftastic ""Changing""'s glorious bongwater drone. ""Changing"" also inserts resounding Druidic bell tolls and harmonies dipped in the magic circle and zodiac cloak. And whenever the shit seems to patter into the shadows, a whirlwind of guitar takes off and the boys bong out a few more rounds. These are such rich landscapes, all mossy and backed with an inked sky, it's like they live in an Arik Roper sunset. Fans of doom and 70s psychedelia have hefty decisions to make these days, so if your budget's limited, here's how things stand on the Sabbath meter: Witch holds my attention more forcefully than the Sword or Pearls & Brass, but less gloriously than Om or Sleep. There's an energy and charisma in this dosage that I find lacking in some of the younger contemporaries. Really, it could be totally nerve-wrackingly debilitating to solo and scream in front of an icon of Mascis' stature, but Thomas imparts himself wonderfully. In fact, by the closing notes of the album's finale, I always forget it's J who's manning the drumkit at all.","Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis gets behind the drum kit for this metal record, a collaboration with two members of Vermont octet and Devendra Banhart cohorts Feathers.

The Memphis Family Album: Music From Memphis Industries Vol. 2,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a867ea9e61561daa57f1/1:1/w_160/777de49a.gif,2006-03-13 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2116-the-memphis-family-album-music-from-memphis-industries-vol-2/,Memphis Industries,"Once upon a time, labels meant something-- or at least that's what the old folks tell me. I never belonged to a singles club, or bought a record based purely on the logo on the spine, but I vaguely recall noticing somewhere in the mid-90s that Matador's ""all wrongs reversed"" slogan kept turning up on my discs, and that Merge, SST, and Sub Pop had a certain cachet that went beyond inventory lists. But then, the internet happened, and labels are now threatened to become as marginalized as cover art, liner notes, and those goddamn sticky binders that prevent me from quickly cracking into CDs. All of which makes the label comp a dinosaur-by-association, an all-star sampler of an outfit's roster in an age where music is often taken á la carte. Still, for a new label trying to craft a distinct identity, this kind of manifesto might not be a futile maneuver-- even if it will inevitably be stripped for parts as soon as it hits the file-sharing bazaars. It's the old bait-and-switch: Hook the listeners in with your big acts, and then deposit a bunch of the no-names in their memory banks before they know what hit 'em. 2006 finds Memphis Industries in a perfect position to execute this trick play, having blessed us with the chimera sounds of the Go! Team and locked up British distribution for Swedish psych faves Dungen. Two tracks from each are the headliners here; nothing we haven't heard before, but ""Friendship Update"" and ""Ta Det Lungt"" still have yet to wear out. As banner holders for Memphis Industries, however, the two bands don't have much of a sound in common, and thus don't suggest any obvious hints about the label's master plan. The answer to the riddle is that there is no answer, at least not in any sense more satisfying than declaring that the artists of indie label Memphis Industries sound exactly as amorphous and vague as the term ""indie"" has become in 2006. The bands that are given the biggest push here, with the two-track treatment, fan out over the breadth of the indiescape: Field Music's Shins-popping, Absentee's Edwyn-Collins-fronts-the-Strokes fantasy, Blue States clinging to the Great Post-Rock Hope. Maybe I just prefer a tease, but the one-shot artists on the compilation stand out in the CMJ-median crowd. The Squire of Somerton may read like someone really into renaissance fairs, but his song ""The Band"" works as a refreshingly bizarre piece of chamber-pop. The Pipettes, meanwhile, have the bandname deadest on capturing my scientist heart, and their effortless neo-girl-group sound seals the deal. In fact, there's nary a sour track on the compilation, with no worse crime than unoriginality ever perpetrated. But with such far-flung diversity, the collection also fails to accomplish the goal of making Memphis Industries a brand with meaning, deepening their profile beyond its keywords: ""British"" and ""independent."" Sure, 12 bands in the vein of the Go! Team would probably produce a much less consistent offering, but if nothing else, it would represent a cohesive mission statement worthy of the kind of unflinching loyalty record geeks once gloried in. As it is, The Memphis Family Album is ultimately as faceless as its name, leaving the label without a personality to cut through the digital anonymity.","Subtitled ""Music From Memphis Industries Vol. 2"", this iTunes-released label compilation features contributions from the Go!

Ballad of the Broken Seas,Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f45e6ef95969320e70/1:1/w_160/77753ef4.jpg,2006-03-13 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1747-ballad-of-the-broken-seas/,V2,"Isobel Campbell was the second-best singer-- and best cellist-- in Belle and Sebastian. Mark Lanegan fronted grunge almost-weres Screaming Trees, one of those odd bands that everyone knows but few listen to, and he did a stint in Queens of the Stone Age. Given Belle and Sebastian's penchant for lacy chamber pop and the Screaming Trees/QOTSA bias toward angrily trippy stoner jams, it only makes sense that Campbell's and Lanegan's collaboration produced a bunch of mildly acerbic sea shanties and maudlin dust-bowl folk ballads. ""Deus Ibi Est"" establishes Ballad of the Broken Seas's mise en scène-- a broad, desolate expanse of metronomic kickdrum and lilting acoustic guitar. Lanegan slips into a Grinchy beatnik drawl, doing Tom Waits doing Leonard Cohen, sharpishly channeling the voice of an itinerant soldier, while Campbell's airy Latin hook (the dead language kind, not the Ricky Martin kind) sounds as if all the Whos down in Whoville wandered into a seedy wharf bar. If you really wanna cut the roast beast, let's say it plain: While Campbell's contributions to the album are far from negligible, the thing reeks of Lanegan, aligning itself with the hard-bitten American roots music of his solo albums. Lanegan's boozy, melancholic growl and down-and-out imagery on ""The Circus Is Leaving Town"" would fit comfortably on a Crooked Fingers record, that pacesetter for all things indie-gone-Americana. He turns in an appropriately smoldering cover of Hank Williams's ""Ramblin' Man"", Campbell's whispered taunts and supplications skewing its narrative POV. Even openly sentimental songs like the hushed, piano-driven title track acquire a thin layer of grit: ""We fucked up the sun to kingdom come/ You were under my blood and my skin."" Campbell's presence seems unavoidably minimized on the duets, as her gusty chirp flutters through the holes in Lanegan's decaying clapboard shack of a voice, yet it's also indispensable, like the color commentary on a televised golf match. Some of the record's most penetrating moments arrive when either Lanegan or Campbell take center stage alone. Lanegan's ""(Do You Wanna) Come Walk With Me?"", despite moments of implied, discomforting pederasty (""Little girl, have I told you how you light up my life?/ Come and lay down beside me, come and thrill me tonight""), features the inarguably vivid and arresting lyrical turn, ""There's a crimson bird flying when I go down on you."" Campbell takes the lead on ""Black Mountain"" and ""Saturday's Gone"", her voice cascading over quivering strings and swirling arpeggios on the former, and riding in on clip-clopping hooves on the latter. The thirty-odd years of musical experience Campbell and Lanegan collectively possess are worn like sun-creased skin on Ballad of the Broken Seas, which manages to be consistently engaging and sufficiently memorable without making too much fuss about it.","Former Belle & Sebastian and Screaming Trees members make an unlikely duo on this ramshackle, whiskey-soaked, Nancy and Lee-like outing.

Hello Young Lovers,Sparks,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d25e6ef95969320e25/1:1/w_160/52d724e4.jpg,2006-03-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7848-hello-young-lovers/,In the Red,"Even if you didn't know these two were brothers, you could probably figure it out by listening to their records. Hello Young Lovers is their 20th full-length in 35 years, the second in a phase we might call ""comeback""; they're favorites of the cognoscenti, back for another round. And yet good god does it still sound so teenaged: They're in their fifties, but they come at their music like two guys with a long, firm grounding in sharing the same bedrooms, watching the same cartoons, and fighting over the same last pork chops. You just know that if they'd gone off young to work with other people, they'd have had all their best qualities stripped off of them; you just know what ""other people"" are like. ""No, this band will not play a song about pineapples or a sing about tits. No, this band will not let you sing like a variety show Freddie Mercury, even if you got there first. No, this band will definitely not let you look like Mr. Rogers with a Hitler mustache."" Together, though-- for years and years-- they get to cooperate in the execution of what's inevitably a suburban-adolescent comic-book fantasy: turning themselves into plasticized Mickey Mouse maestros, the class clowns and mischief-makers at the music conservatory. The title of their last album: Little Beethoven, undoubtedly a scamp. That adolescence runs right into the lyrics on this one, matching up with the older-guy prerogative to not take things so damned seriously. Young lovers do post-breakup aimlessness: ""The sun comes up, the sun goes down/ And all I do is dick around."" (Then the song breaks out into fake-metal Slayer.) More experienced lovers prefer to woman who wears no perfume, because: ""The olfactory sense is the sense that most strongly evokes memories of the past/ Well, screw the past."" And older, wiser lovers have good advice for the young ones, including the best thing I've heard in song this year: ""Chicks chicks dig dig D-I-G dig dig METAPHORS."" (""Use them wisely, use them well/ And you will never know the hell/ Of loneliness."") There's that same Mickey Mouse teendom in the music, too, which folds tricks from across a long career into one package-- including contributions from some longtime Sparks collaborators. It's largely drumless and ""orchestral,"" which is to say that it pops along on staccato strings and runs through lots of flouncing arrangements; the sound has the airtight feel of a software symphony. Other songs dance along on keyboards, sequencers, and fussy guitars, making little minuets, romping happily around the notions of corniness and camp. Real-world product testing reveals that it's a little bothersome on headphones in the subway (just makes you tense) and terrific on speakers during at-home downtime (perfect for laundry-folding). Something teenaged about that, too-- the way they're better when you're bored. The one teenaged thing they're missing, unfortunately, is an adolescent attention span, the kind that flogs an idea for two minutes and then moves on to something else. These songs go on too long, even to the point of faking fade-outs and then bursting back for another coda. They drag and repeat themselves and wander and occasionally come off a little all the same. They're adorable-- just probably not as strong as anyone on this side of the speakers would like. Mickey Mouse maestros have a bit of the mickeymouse this time-- but the trick's still a good one, and bless them for keeping it going.","The Mael Brothers re-locate to In the Red Records for their 20th LP in 35 years.

Superstructure,Dell and Flügel,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd35e6ef95969322ce3/1:1/w_160/95b64461.gif,2006-03-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2639-superstructure/,Laboratory Instinct,"Roman Flügel is one of techno's great shapeshifters, recording everything from crunching electro, drum & bass so spare it sounds as if it was made out of twigs and debris, and every shade of house-- from tribal to deep to proto-micro to acid revival. But Pitchfork readers without deep crates probably know him best as the creator of two of the most inescapable techno anthems of the past two years: ""Gehts Noch?"" (under his own name) and ""Rocker"" (as one half of Alter Ego). These two riff wraiths would do Angus Young and DJ Pierre equally proud. There's very little anthemic about Superstructure, however, and even less that's rockin'. Instead, Flügel's collaboration with vibraphonist Christopher Dell turns the concept of ""jazzy techno"" on its head. Fading in on some liquid synth pads and gently brushed, twitchy hi-hats reminiscent of the straighter Farben tracks, the opening title track is quickly upended by a fountain of vibes from Dell. Flügel's beat constructions tease and hint at traditionally club friendly sounds like house and techno and even a kind of lopsided hip-hop without actually coming out and stating them, as Dell sprinkles runs of vibes like Pollock tossing pigment. ""Habitation"" recalls the starved drum & bass Flügel has made under the Eight Miles High alias, while ""Miniaturisation"" provides what you'd expect, an almost microtonal duet for drums and vibes that barely resolves into anything as coarse as a groove. ""4 Door Body Cell"" hews closer to traditional techno, but it's traditionalism pales compared to the more outre experiments, whether they congeal or not. (They usually do.) Dell is a classically trained vibist whose insistence on repetition has put him at odds with ""free"" jazz orthodoxy even as it puts him in close proximity to techno. And at its best Superstructure has a hands on, jammed feeling that rubs with productive friction against the rigidity of drum machines. Superstructure is a dark but not oppressive album; the cover, featuring thin white line schematics over a solid black background captures the feeling as much as anything. Dell and Flügel have made an album that recognizes jazz as an engine for improvisation rather than organ or piano samples to be draped over a 4/4 beat. At times it reminds you of everything from the crooked spines of Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch to the astro-black portamento funk of Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi band.

7,Supersilent,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0935e6ef9596931ffab/1:1/w_160/5ddac76c.jpeg,2006-03-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7632-7/,Rune Grammofon,"When Supersilent first appear at the start of this film, it looks like they're walking onto an average stage at the front of any theater. Google tells me that the Parkteatret in Oslo, Norway is a classy venue, but this could be the front of any kind of room anywhere-- there's nothing distinctive about it. The four members settle down at their instruments, trumpeter Arve Henriksen sitting square in the middle while Helge Sten and Ståle Storløkken flank him on each side; Jarle Vespestad's drumkit sits elevated at the back. This is Supersilent's live setup, and we're seeing it for the first time on DVD, entirely in black and white. Then the lights dim, and the space is transformed. As the first piece opens, Henriksen sits bathed in shadow; in some frames we see nothing but his right ear and the glint off his trumpet. Storløkken's shots backlight him dramatically while he coaxes piercing tones from his keyboard, and though Sten also goes by the name Deathprod, he's the least ominous of the four, hunching under a spotlight as he manipulates effects and plays low notes on a knee-high keyboard. By the time Vespestad gets real camera time, his eyes are closed and he's leaning calmly into a barrage of jittery beats and analog ticks like appliances switching on and off-- which the film matches with double images, abstract and out-of-focus shots, and other cinematic devices. 7 captures a single, complete concert from August 2004, and finds more structure than their previous concert album, 5. Each piece runs from 10 minutes to half an hour, and the band usually starts with one member playing alone, before the rest of the group joins or withdraws from the improvisation until it builds to torrents of beats and rhythms like carpet tacks thrown into a windstorm. The process is even more engrossing on film, where we can watch them discover the lulls and explosions of ""7.3"", or hesitate, play, and then fall silent during the encore. While their music remains non-idiomatic, Storløkken hits several 1970s reference points, adding the King Crimson-esque mellotron that opens ""7.3"", or harshly analog tones like something out of ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"". At the peak of ""7.1"", he even breaks out a vamp-- Supersilent's only funky moment on record. But Henriksen is even more surprising. An awesomely gentle soul by the sound of his playing, he constructs solos out of the slightest breath sounds, or sings in a powerfully frail falsetto. And yet on stage, he's never precious, beaming big smiles to the audience and the band. He's also singing more nowadays, and at the end of ""7.2"" he grabs the mic and belts some made-up tune, landing somewhere between a punk and a soul singer. The cinematography and lighting define the experience with a heavy hand. (All three cameramen, including Rune Grammofon's house artist Kim Hiorthøy, and both lighting engineers get credits on a sleeve that doesn't even list the members of the band.) The stark b&w; footage turns the simple stage into a boundless empty space or a UFO landing, then pens it in, evoking a primitive, flame-licked cavern. Sometimes the gimmicks make it feel like a kooky art-school project; nonetheless, it's one of the most engrossing and well-conceived concert films of the past few years. The strobe lights, the distortions, and the occasional blinding swell of light that engulfs the band from behind, all complement the music; they illustrate its ambiguity, and its endless, shadowy corners.","Recorded at the Parkteatret in Oslo, Norway, in 2004, this live DVD finds the Rune Grammofon band to be more focused and aggressive than on its previous concert album, 5.

Dave Chappelle's Block Party OST,Various Artists,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7059d034d5c69bf36bd/1:1/w_160/20025bb7.jpg,2006-03-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7899-dave-chappelles-block-party-ost/,Geffen,"Apparently, Dave Chappelle is obsessed with the same musicians as I was in high school. Black Star and the Roots and Common and Dead Prez are captivating artists, for sure. But in some ways, I grew out of them. The world of hip-hop extends further than Okayplayer, Rawkus, and creaky neo-soul, despite the inviting bubble they create. The man often anointed World's Funniest Dude evidently doesn't see things this way: When Chappelle threw his dream concert one Brooklyn afternoon in 2004, he chose these artists, as well as Kanye West. Two years on, Chappelle released the results as a concert film-- his own personal Wattstax. This soundtrack compiles some of the live music found therein. Label politics kept the most thrilling stuff on the shelf, which means the film's gooey yet uplifting feeling is emulated here to much weaker effect. On screen, director Michel Gondry's jumbled narrative expertly raises dramatic tension with certain performances, then rips back to Chappelle, who we see joyously organizing his show and riffing on everything in sight. Similarly, each track on this album is broken up by bits from an epic conference call between all of the artists that performed, recorded at some point before the show. Initially, it seems like a wonderful, revealing idea: These guys are all good friends and have no problem clowning each other (especially Mos Def). But 10 or 20 listens later, I'm no longer amused by stic.man referring to himself as ""stickie-ickie-ickie,"" or Jill Scott bitching to ?uestlove, the show's musical director, about refusing to play anything off her first album. ?uesto (aka Ahmir Thompson) has long overseen the entire Okayplayer/Rawkus axis, holding himself responsible for getting folks together to record, and often exec producing albums. It's admirable work he does, shepherding so many big personalities. Unfortunately, his mix on this extraordinarily rare live hip-hop album is average at best. Sometimes the vocals are pushed way up, sometimes down. There are going to be glitches at any show, but all the feedback on a slow burner like ""Umi Says"" is downright distracting, especially when Mos Def is singing that beautifully. Alternately, the ever-magnetic Erykah Badu's ""Back in the Day"" is so scat-filled and loose it needs a hair net. Talib Kweli, bothered by a sore throat, actually sounds kinda hard on ""Definition"" and ""The Blast"". I guess all this time it wasn't the overstuffed verses and tangled syntax weighing him down; he just needed to sound more like Juvenile. Elsewhere, Dead Prez give up a chunky, rock-ish version of their stand-by ""Hip-Hop"", in which stic.man's a cappella verse exists in an odd zone between histrionic bullshit and outstandingly inspired. There are a few gripping musical moments in the film that fail to appear here-- particularly a Dayton-based college marching band's snappy rendition of West's ""Jesus Walks"", as well as a pretty dope version (!) of Wyclef Jean's ""If I Was President"" recorded in some shack in front of said marching band. The biggest omission, however, is the awe-inspiring version of ""Killing Me Softly"" that the still-luminous Lauryn Hill churns out near the film's end. I don't know that there's anything that can be said about Lauryn that hasn't been already, and personally, I thought I never wanted to hear that Fugees song again. Turns out I was wrong; it's soul-shaking, glassy-eyed stuff and it's not here. Chappelle's incredible, faux-James Brown gags are sadly absent, too: They'd have made far stronger interludes. There was a crystallized period where love, swagger, and uncompromising musicianship were de rigueur for outer-circle hip-hop. These days, Mos is a film star, Dead Prez are more riling than righteous, and Badu's been missing in action since 2003's Worldwide Underground. Common and the Roots have aged better, but while their music remains ever thoughtful, their messages lean too flowery. Still, it's nice that every once in a while, dudes like Chappelle will wrangle them up and say, ""What about this shit, America?!"" Just next time make sure you get the Fugees cleared.","Soundtrack to a film documenting a 2004 Brooklyn show curated by Dave Chappelle features appearances by the Roots, Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Jill Scott-- but not the Fugees or Kanye.

Dead Drunk,Terrestrial Tones,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a897b1335d7bf16992fc/1:1/w_160/a10cf603.jpg,2006-03-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8284-dead-drunk/,Paw Tracks,"Seeing that Animal Collective's Avey Tare and Black Dice's Eric Copeland are roommates, it's little surprise that the Brooklyn pair end up collaborating between their chief commitments and touring schedules. As Terrestrial Tones, the duo generate the kind of prickly, experimental soundscapes that you might expect from such a meeting of creative minds. There's more evidence of Black Dice's rickety, shorn racket than Animal Collective's pastoral improv however, and after getting feisty with the contact mics, Tare and Copeland are left with an effervescent thicket of electronic bleating and arbitrary sound effects. Over this, they add layers of indecipherable, barbed lyrics that sound as though they're sung from an underground lair soaked in blood and brambles. This can be challenging at times-- for example, when the music loses momentum and drifts into an abyss of white noise. For the most part though, the seemingly endless boundaries and subtly propulsive rhythms draw the listener into an engaging world of manipulated samples and shimmering loops. Dead Drunk was recorded while Copeland and Portner were living in Paris last summer. Just how much their environment affected the output is unclear. Unlike CocoRosie's La Maison De Mon Reve, which the Brooklyn sisters also recorded while living together in Paris, Dead Drunk doesn't exactly conjure up images of winding streets and champagne sunsets over the Sacre Coeur. It's more reflective of the hyperactive grit of the weekly flea markets, where the pair apparently spent a lot of time prowling through the maze of discarded records, dismantled Soviet era electronic equipment and junkyard bits and bobs. This third album is much more concise as a whole than the group's 40 minute ""single,"" Oboroed / Circus Lives. Some of Terrestrial Tones' previous output has sounded like little more than two mates smoking a few joints at home and playing around with their computers, and is only likely to appeal to either serious fans of noise music, or Copeland and Portner's other bands. Dead Drunk stands its ground as a more interesting compositional entity. The tracks entwine and inform each other-- malleable rhythms budge, contract and twist in a way that ties each track to the next in unexpected ways. The flow between second track, ""The Sailor"", right into the fifth, ""Magic Trick"" is just one example of Dead Drunk's compelling continuity and focus, and sieve Terrestrial Tones out of the murky realms of an on/off side project and into a field where the quality of their efforts match those of their main bands.","Latest collaboration between roommates and Brooklyn music linchpins Avey Tare (Animal Collective) and Eric Copeland (Black Dice).

Etiquette,Casiotone for the Painfully Alone,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5449d034d5c69bf327a/1:1/w_160/74742abf.jpg,2006-03-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1338-etiquette/,Tomlab,"Your mid-twenties can be tough. Casiotone-man Owen Ashworth sounds like he's trying to provide a soundtrack to that sentiment. The tired plonking of big fingers on little keyboards, the resigned lo-fi mumbling, the slacker-bedroom tale telling-- they're tired, morose, frustrated, sick of waiting. You'd think the schtick would get old, but it hasn't; it may be too primal, too basic. Every one of us, after all, has written ""songs"" like these, even if they're as simple as tapping a rolled-up waiting-room magazine on your leg and grumbling, ""My appointment was for two o'clock/ Why is my dentist such a cock?"" They're the songs you sing to yourself when you have problems too banal to expect anyone else to care about-- which is the college grad's mid-twenties in a nutshell. I've seen Ashworth perform twice, once in a big venue and once in a dorm lobby; the first seemed awkward, the second natural. He's big, sloppy, dry in his humor: It seemed like some freshman shut-in had dragged his gear into the hallway to bother everyone. The brief (30-minute) Etiquette is a step forward for him, musically-- it complicates things, cleans them up, brings in contributions from his friends, and even conjures up some Postal Service sheen. But the crux of it is still the storytelling. A lot of Ashworth's songs are two minutes and two verses long: Act One and Act Two of some tale or other about middle-class 20-something kids doing cruddy everyday middle-class 20-something stuff. It's to his credit that he's not looking to romanticize that stuff. Most of his time is spent doing the opposite: cutting back to the plainness of reality, the lack of romance. ""New Year's Kiss"" starts with someone trudging home hung over, which is exactly how Ashworth and even his drum machine sound. An afternoon spent reconstructing the night reveals a kiss more boring than hoped-- not ""on a balcony with champagne lips/ But in a pantry against some pancake mix."" The song ends without further comment. ""I Love Creedence"" is even more banal and even more affecting. Childhood friends move to Philadelphia to live on family money. One meets a guy and moves out. The lonely remaining kid gets a job like everyone else. If not quite indie-scene haiku, there's at least the smell of Carver and Fred Barthelme and ""K-Mart Realism"" here-- the everyday snapshot and the relentless leaving-it-at-that, the implication (but never the evidence) that it all really matters, man. Why it seems to matter: because something just as normal happened to you, and it certainly felt important, even if you were no closer than Ashworth to figuring out what it meant. ""What it meant"" is the third verse, the one Casiotone songs omit. All of which is pretty typical indie-- this desire to talk just like everyone else around you, and make music like you don't necessarily know any more about your instrument than they do. There's some of that latter impulse still present, in the way the one-note trudge of ""New Year's Kiss"" is lifted from Pavement's ""Here"", or the way the next track sounds like bedroom synth-poppers Vitesse, who sound like one-time bedroom synth-poppers Magnetic Fields. In other words, this isn't invention; it's a style. The style says rickety bedroom Casio is as ""real"" as it gets, even if it's second-general passed-down real, every bit as stylized as hip-hop's occasional crack-era nostalgia. (Of course, the crack era's waned, whereas the world of bored, lonely college grads holds steady.) More credit to Ashworth, then, for stretching his musical wings here. Around the usual minimal plonks and the usual overdriven fuzz-bombs, there are live instruments, guest vocalists, and songs like ""Nashville Parthenon""-- the track is detailed and modern like a Figurine number, and a thrill when pedal steel comes cruising in unexpectedly. The improvements raise questions, though. Ashworth has set himself up to talk to people who are (presumably) just like him-- describing love and friendship as played out in crappy apartments, both for the people who live in them and the college kids soon to join. But is that it? Can he talk to anyone else? Couldn't he make something even less rickety, something pitch-perfect enough to tell those stories more widely-- just as Morrissey, one of his models, once did? For now, he sounds in between: Etiquette gives up the homemade purity of Casiotone's first few records, but it hasn't entirely gotten where it's going, either.","Owen Ashworth crafts a delicate, affecting soundtrack to life in your mid-twenties.

Halos & Lassos,Half-Handed Cloud,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0455e6ef95969323513/1:1/w_160/a49814fe.jpg,2006-03-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3716-halos-lassos/,Asthmatic Kitty,"If Christian music has been less maligned of late, its saving grace has been a handful of artists who approach their faith with nuance and vulnerability rather than the kind of oblivious cheerleading that is the genre's earmark. So when Sufjan Stevens pens a song as compassionate as ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."", he's hardly promoting clown-costumed serial murder. Instead, he's acknowledging that life isn't as black and white as the majority of Christian music would have you believe. You'd think a little of that emotional depth would have rubbed off on John Ringhoefer, aka Half-Handed Cloud, when he served as trombonist in Stevens' touring band, the Illinoisemakers. But on Halos & Lassos, Half-Handed Cloud's fourth full-length, Ringhoefer continues his relentlessly upbeat exploration of his Christian faith with all the willful naiveté of a Sunday School lesson planner. It's hard not to roll your eyes at cutesy declarations like, ""The world is still the Lord's/ The devil's just a squatter"" or the nursery rhyme directness of ""You get all the credit and you get all the praise/ Got us out of messes and pulled us out of graves."" But, to be fair, Ringhoefer's songs are teeming with enough biblical allusion and tongue-in-cheek theology to elevate it above 99% of Christian music. Like past Half-Handed Cloud albums, Ringhoefer doesn't skimp on sugary pop, but Halos & Lassos strays from his formula with the addition of the Omnichord, a vintage synthesizer that spits out a canned rhythm section, video game soundtrack keys and a gurgling water effect. It's a novelty that tires very quickly. But still, out of the Omnichord's thrift store lo-fi, each song blossoms with the integration of an organic instrumental palate. Beautiful passages of piano, banjo, marimba, and bells erupt out of the monochrome of ersatz drums and sustained eight-bit tones. On the album's longest track, ""You've Been Faithful to Us Clouds"", the song bobs along to a synth arpeggio before abruptly transitioning into a saccharine multi-part harmony. And as sparse live drums punctuate Ringhoefer's oohs, the vibrancy of a live performance rescues the song from languishing in demo hell. Half-Handed Cloud's real draw, though, is his peculiar, ADHD take on pop music. With 19 songs clocking in at just shy of a half-hour, the album's spitfire sequencing speeds by, making you feel like the Ramones wrote some really epic songs. It's a quirk that's both frustrating and enticing: There's no chance of digesting these songs on the first, second, or even third pass, but the blink-and-you'll-miss-it nature of it all leaves a listener hungry to make sense of such a confounding blur. If you're blessed with the patience to unpack such a dense record, Halos & Lassos has enough compelling melody to help you forgive that ubiquitous Omnichord and some truly cloying lyrics. And, surely, that's something worthy of our praise.","Asthmatic Kitty artist continues to explore sugary pop, often here with the help of the Omnichord, a vintage synthesizer.

Sound Mirrors,Coldcut,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a619c0084474cd0c0899/1:1/w_160/4000170a.jpg,2006-03-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1537-sound-mirrors/,Ninja Tune,"Coldcut were incredibly overrated. Past tense is critical here because the moment in which Coldcut were feted feels like a hundred million years ago now. Concepts like trip-hop, turntablism, etc., aren't quite past tense enough to stir warm feelings of nostalgia. They're ""what the fuck were we thinking?"" ideas in 2006, and no one wants to listen to records that give them the feeling of looking at old photos of themselves with bad haircuts and stupid clothes. Sure, no genre is completely devoid of good ideas-- or even, more importantly, good records-- but there's a landfill full of ""abstract beats"" out there that no one's stepped up to reclaim. If you want a real laugh, read the second half of the Rough Guide to Drum and Bass devoted to big beat/downtempo. What the fuck were we thinking? So, while, yes, better than the bulk of their Ninja Tune-affiliated peers, Coldcut were not as good as we once believed. That Eric B and Rakim remix that Eric B and Rakim hated-- it's really not that great, is it? I'd rather listen to ""Pump Up the Volume"" than ""Beats and Pieces"" for my kitschy sampladelic single fix. And while concepts like multimedia and chopping up the history of recorded music seemed like not just a good idea at the time but the very future itself, information overload isn't an exciting concept in 2006, it just is. (Plus their Journeys by DJ record is the most overrated DJ mix of all time.) So credit them for getting there first, but don't flog pioneer status to tell me why I should listen to the records. Sound Mirrors isn't a cut-and-paste DJ record per se, but it's constructed in the same way. Instead of slamming chunks of disparate records together via sampler or turntable, they wrangle a few albums' worth of guest stars and hop from genre to genre like Q*Bert. (The video game sprite, not the Skratch Pikl. At least I think so.) ""Walk a Mile"" tries on the shimmering fabric of smooth, gauzy deep house, complete with vocals from the original voice of post-coital, outerspace ennui, Robert Owens. Saul Williams hectors ""Mr. Nichols"" from an era where we thought poetry slams and poetry slams on rap records were a good idea, and ""This Island Earth"" reminds you just how hard people worked the thin concept of a female singer over a mid-tempo rap beat in the late-90s. If you've ever wanted to hear Jon Spencer and Mike Ladd on the same track, Sound Mirrors is for you, and the pairing, or even just the concept of the pairing, will tell you whether or not you need to hear it. Coldcut acquit themselves well, in the sense that they pull off all of their various generic sleights of hand. But, as per usual, whatever off-hand virtuosity Sound Mirrors displays, there's no center here. No one likes a show-off.","Comeback album from the Ninja Tune success story/90s museum pieces.

The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower / The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy / The Early Four Track Recordings,Of Montreal,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f5b1335d7bf16983aa/1:1/w_160/ee518e84.jpg,2006-03-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11872-the-bird-who-continues-to-eat-the-rabbits-flower-the-bedside-drama-a-petite-tragedy-the-early-four-track-recordings/,KindercoreKindercore,"The argument as to whether it's more difficult to write a catchy song or a complicated song will probably never be settled. There is, however, little doubt that few songwriters can pull off both at the same time. Over the course of seven studio albums and countless singles and compilation tracks, Of Montreal mastermind Kevin Barnes has demonstrated a magician-like ability cramming freakish numbers of indelible hooks into pretzel-tight songs. These early reissues are sadly lacking the kind of jaw-dropping moments that grace Of Montreal's best work, but offer a generally solid glimpse into the band's formative period. The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower, an eight-song mini-album released between the band's excellent debut Cherry Peel and the more unwieldy Bedside Drama, is the jewel of these three releases. Bird primarily consists of concise Beatlesque pop but hints at the dizzying dynamics and mile-a-minute chord changes that would define the band's sound. ""You Are an Airplane"" and ""Disguises"" are sweet and bouncy, kept aloft by tight, fluid harmonies. ""If I Faltered Slightly Twice"" combines chipmunk vocals and earnest piano tinkling into a surprisingly moving mini-epic. Barnes sounds uncharacteristically hesitant here, but it works to his advantage, lending these songs an air of humility and wonder. The Bedside Drama: serves as a more obvious and awkward midpoint between the immediate likeability of early Of Montreal and the manic complexity of their later records. The Bedside Drama, with its more thematic lyrics and reoccurring characters, is the most ambitious of these releases. Album opener ""One of a Very Few of a Kind"" is the kind of sweet, short, pseudo-conceptual love song at which Barnes always seems to excel, but for the most part The Bedside Drama: is merely unrealized potential, rarely registering as more than pretty sonic wallpaper. The fanciful themes that would make later albums so exciting only seem to reinforce The Bedside Drama:'s status as decorative music. While a clear stylistic line can be drawn from The Bird to The Bedside Drama, The Early Four Track Recordings is the wildcard here. Aside from the obvious parallels in recording technique, The Early Four Track Recordings brings to mind the haphazardly rich songwriting of early Guided by Voices. ""Dustin Hoffman's Wife Comes Home"" is among the most directly moving songs in Of Montreal's catalog, winding seamlessly through a chorus of ""the telephone only lets me borrow the comforts of your voice."" The stripped-down four-track treatment suits many of these songs remarkably well, and bring out an emotional depth that's sometimes obscured by Barnes' complicated arrangements. Of Montreal's early catalog contains its share of classics-- ""Don't Ask Me to Explain"" from the band's debut Cherry Peel still stands as one of the best indie pop songs of the 90s. However, at this stage in the band's development, it hadn't mastered the conceptually unified long-player. The fantastical characters aren't quite fantastical enough, the frequent unexpected chord changes are often more distracting than propulsive, and the instrumental interludes are just plain dull. Interestingly, these three releases carve out a stylistic niche not at all dissimilar from Satanic Panic in the Attic, far and away Of Montreal's best record. The difference, really, comes down to six solid years of songwriting. These albums are not without their charms, but even child-like wonder gets better with practice.","e.

Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue / In the L..L..Library Loft,Kayo DotToby Driver,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc525e6ef95969322dfe/1:1/w_160/750539c9.jpg,2006-03-09 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11771-dowsing-anemone-with-copper-tongue-in-the-lllibrary-loft/,Robotic EmpireRobotic Empire,"Kayo Dot plays in drips and torrents. The violin's tweaking high notes and the cautious breath noises from the trumpet hint at a crisis that hits with full force when the heavy metal half of the band crashes in, loud and without warning. Frontman Toby Driver may look like he weighs 90 pounds wet but his delicate, wounded-doe croon can whip into a head-squeezing shriek. The band's combination of chamber instruments, psychedelia and metal gives it an almost delusional appeal, like absinthe chased with Genny Cream Ale, or the sparks you see on your eyelids when someone clocks you in the head. Church-burners and 10-year-old boys may think they're soft, and sometimes they struggle to find the right balance between both sides of the band. But if you like your violence framed by surreal mumbojumbo, you may find them awe-awakening; the slow sections are suspenseful, and the climaxes will make your hair jump off your head. This Boston band, formed by ex-members of Maudlin of the Well, debuted with 2003's excellent Choirs of the Eye. This year's follow-up, Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue, is more methodical: the quality's more consistent, but they've lost Choirs' crazy highs and lurching segues. Kayo Dot has toured with both Khanate and Cerberus Shoal, and you can hear similitarities to both bands: Songs like ""Immortelle and Paper Caravelle"" have grave-like patience and small, scratchy gestures, while the strings and trumpet fuel a proggy instrumental on ""Aura on an Asylum Wall"", until a noisy outburst cuts it off. And the album's centerpiece, ""__ On Limpid Form"", drags you through a 13-minute death knell with guitars that groan like a bridge taking all day to collapse. Driver has strengthened the two extremes of his singing-- blissed-out, or drawn and quartered-- and although the vocal passages are brief, they frame a satisfying release. He also uses his voice briefly and eerily on his solo debut from last fall, In the L..L..Library Loft, a more somnolent take on Kayo Dot's style. This one's on Tzadik, and yes, it's yet another in that label's non-stop catalog of horror soundtrack-style records-- but Driver handles the task well, and he delivers an engrossing, cinematic production that features Kayo Dot's Forbes Graham on trumpet and Mia Matsumiya on violin, tuning forks, and ""two-tongue vocal."" Tracks one and four especially are the keepers: ""Eptaceros"" delivers an entrancing exchange between Driver's voice and Graham's trumpet, while opener ""Kandu vs. Corky (Horrorca)"" scales the same molten heights as Kayo Dot, but with an all-chamber ensemble and two cavernous drummers pushing it forward. On this cut, you get the scale of metal without the rock beat or the attack-- leaving just the glory of cascading guitar noise and throat-wringing passion. As Pinhead would say, it's ""pain and pleasure, indivisible.""","New album from the Boston art-rockers, as well as a solo turn from their lead singer.

Fabric 25 / Fabric 26,Carl CraigGlobal Communications,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6989d034d5c69bf3593/1:1/w_160/d02de542.jpg,2006-03-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11705-fabric-25-fabric-26/,Fabric,"""Where's Carl Craig been?"" my boss asked me a few weeks ago. ""Just hiding somewhere being quietly genius?"" Well, yes and no. Craig's output hasn't quite been as nonstop as his 1990s run of albums and singles, but he's still on the grind. He recently overhauled 1995's classic Landcruising-- now known as, well, The Album Formerly Known As... since the original is tied up in contractual disputes-- as a limited edition, vinyl import that's surprisingly one of the few you-didn't-ask-for-it-but-here-it-is re-recordings that improves upon the original. He released the great, grinding tech-house single ""Sandstorm"", sounding just like its title. And he's produced highly feted remixes for Delia and Gavin and Theo Parrish, although in both cases I can't quite hear what the fuss is about. And he also released this Fabric mix. Standing just to the right of contemporary dancefloor trends, Fabric 25 is mostly house music you thought they didn't make anymore, almost shockingly basic and rhythmically direct, focused on the push-push-push-in-the-bush of a swishing or pounding 4/4 groove. Though Craig cheekily opens with the Ying Yang Twins' ""Wait""-- plus some very Craigian atmospheric techno pads, turning it into the filthiest Basic Channel track you've ever heard-- there are no other curveballs. Tracks like Kenny Larkin's ""Good God"" and D'Malicious' ""Alive"" are transfusions of the gospel and soul blood that has been leeched out of house and techno in the 21st-century, and titles like ""Africanism"" tell you all you need to know. This is a mix made by someone who still hears house and techno as an extension of black popular music, something played during drive-time radio. (Right down to the bizarre ad-libs Craig drops on the mic throughout, somewhere between DJ Assault and DJ Kayslay.) While not quite screaming diva house, and though Craig's own ""Darkness"" sounds very much like a childhood spent listening to Kraftwerk, this isn't one for fans of Germanic eyewear. Global Communication aren't quite in Craig's league as either producers or DJs, but they similarly stand outside whatever's going on in the Month in Techno column. Best known for the gauzy, gorgeous ""Ob-Selon Mi-Nos"", aka the more baldly titled ""14:31""-- a tick-tock ambient techno track that GlobCom's Tom Middleton crafted as a requiem for his grandfather-- the pair has genre hopped from hard techno to drum & bass to downtempo and back again. Middleton is an especially enjoyable eclectic DJ-- the e-word usually being a sign of jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none-- who will slam handbag house Missy Elliott remixes into Bollywood drum & bass re-edits. At their best, Global Communication (or under their now-suppressed Jedi Knights moniker) seem like the kind of guys who don't care where a record gets racked in the stores provided it rocks the party-- without thinking they've reinvented the wheel for realizing a Cure song and ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" are the same tempo. Fabric 26 won't quite have the walls dripping with sweat, but it's also a nice change pace from choking on sleek and vacuous electro-house, clip-clop minimalism, and disco bongos played by bearded stoners. If anything, Fabric 26 is made up of deeply unfashionable genres-- leftfield hip-hop, downtempo, broken beat, classic techno, and deep house. (No one likes broken beat for cred purposes; go up to a haircut in a Williamsburg bar and start excitedly talking about Daz-I-Kue and see if it gets you laid.) Nine tracks of lazy hip-hop beats softly kick us onto the dancefloor where we stand and nod and sip cocktails, stretching from the bass-heavy loping wobble of Dabrye to a cut-and-scratch routine from ex-junglist legend Danny Breaks. Steve Spacek curls some barely-there soul like wisps from a menthol cigarette and Maspyke (who?) tongue twists over liquid smoke horns on ""Lightly Anxious"". Things drift out of focus a bit in the middle, ironically as the tempo picks up into Chicago and Detroit revivalism. When the beat gets broken again towards the final fourth of the disc, attention snaps back into focus in time with those swinging triplets. (Seriously, it's a good genre, give it chance.) Fabric 26 is maybe not so good for dancing (even in your bedroom), but perfect for reading or, hey, writing record reviews. And, like I said, it's a nice change of pace, one that will probably sell approximately 1/8th of the proposed Villalobos installment, if the Fabric people ever resort to the bamboo shoots it's gonna take to get the disc outta him.

Greatest Hits: Sound and Vision,Blondie,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b2c0084474cd0c054f/1:1/w_160/7f8b6048.jpg,2006-03-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1198-greatest-hits-sound-and-vision/,EMI,"Blondie's conceptual coup wasn't pairing punk's tautness with bubblegum hooks. It was being good at it, in the actual putting-records-in-the-charts sense. Arguably the Ramones got there first and certainly had a more lasting impact on whatever we think of as pop-punk (or punk-pop depending on your feelings on modifiers). But Blondie were also never going to inspire someone like avant composer Rhys Chatham to start a punk guitar trio as an adjunct to his explorations in post-academic minimalism. The Ramones were as much a conceptual art project with pudding bowl haircuts as a pop band. It certainly didn't hurt that Blondie had one of the most appealing frontwomen of the late 20th-century-- who looks positive H-O-T on the cover of Sound and Vision, the latest repackaging of their greatest hits, despite (because of?) wearing just a pillow case and red electrical tape. Whereas the Ramones had four praying mantis in girl's Jordache. And while the Ramones were positively vicious in their devotion to pre-hippie rock (recording with Phil Spector, for one) and transforming the starchy blandness of '70s suburbia into a positive aesthetic, Blondie embraced what we now know as The Future-- disco, hip-hop, reggae-- while helping to invent new wave. (Your feelings on that one may vary). It's hard to imagine a time now when that seemed heretical, probably because it's hard to remember a time now when Blondie was a punk band with a capital P, trading dirty looks with Legs McNeil and waiting backstage with Richard Hell. All of these songs, most especially the big hits, have become part of the shared classic rock heritage of anyone born after 1970. They belong to the Two-Fer Tuesdays and budget priced '80s comps now. And it's hard to imagine the members of Blondie-- don't forget, ""Blondie is a Band""-- seeing this as anything less than a total good. Through sheer willpower they achieved their goal: to become one of the great pop bands of all time. So why buy another reiteration of songs everyone knows? Well, if you don't already own a Blondie best-of for one thing. I've had a copy of The Best of Blondie since I was about 8, but those Fisher Price record player needles were hell on vinyl, so I'm happy to have *Sound and Vision in lieu of looting through Goodwill bins. (*The Best of Blondie is still available on CD, of course, and that's an A+++/five star/10.0 record. So take that for what it's worth.) Everyone knows the songs, but I'll give special shouts to: ""Hanging on the Telephone"" (gender flip-flop new wave frustration); ""One Way or Another"" (the Pretenders in situ, with added sass); ""Heart of Glass"" (Abba for the legwarmers generation); ""Atomic"" (the single having the best record sleeve ever); ""Dreaming"" (buzz-saw bubblegum with caveman drums); ""The Tide Is High"" (proto-Gwen Stefani cod-reggae); ""Rapture"" (the first time I ever heard of anything called ""rap"" though I wouldn't have known it from Adam). Marks against: it contains neither ""X Offender"" or ""(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear"", both of which are on the European version. (Not really a reason to book that ticket for Berlin but there was certainly room on the CD.) It also contains a few au courant (if this was 2001) electro-flavored remixes in favor of the originals that need to get gone yesterday. It ends with a goofy mash-up of ""Rapture"" with the vocals from ""Riders on the Storm"", which is fun the first time, but the compilers made the right decision sticking it where they did. The other reason to buy is that Sound and Vision comes with a DVD of all of Blondie's videos, which, yes, may seem like a cynical grab at your wallet, especially if you already forked out for another compilation or the album re-masters that came out in 2001. With the advent of VH1 Classic-- and stand alone DVD collections-- owning your own copy of ""Heart of Glass"" might not seem so cool as when we were all fussing with VHS doorstops but you'll want it if you get off on the cheap charms of early music video. Plus there's the always luminous Deborah Harry, who could give boiling asparagus an erotic charge, all while looking too bored to live.","Yet another compilation from the punk-pop greats, this adds a Doors mashup, a few remixes, and, more importantly, a DVD.

Victimizer,Mikkel Metal,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5400c2bba1b7de01422/1:1/w_160/8a801480.jpg,2006-03-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5634-victimizer/,Kompakt,"Mikkel Meldgaard has a name that sounds like it belongs to a Tolkein character and a vision of techno that's as bloodyminded as anyone's. At some point in the 1990s, Meldgaard must have had his wig seriously pulled back by the wriggling, static-ridden, techno-as-lifeform that came out of the Basic Channel camp. Since roughly the beginning of the decade/century/millennium, he's been panning for gold in the silty stream of post-BC dub techno; his releases on his own label Echocord, Kompakt, and others have delighted at the subtle variations in texture of rustling noise over deep basslines and functional beats. If anyone wanted to remake Woman of the Dunes, Meldgaard's slowly shifting grainscapes would be the perfect soundtrack to being buried alive in a sandlot. So as you might expect, Victimizer doesn't deviate broadly from his comfort zone; it could only be further from 2006's disco baubles and hygienic neo-trance if he actually started sending his singles into the world smeared with peat and moss. Like the furthest reaches of what-we-used-to-call-microhouse-but-doesn't-really-have-a-name-now-- Jan Jelinek's Farben productions, the recent work of Ricardo Villalobos-- Meldgaard's music is ""dance"" because there are beats buried under the textural slurry. But unlike the crunching, bristling rhythms of Basic Channel or even the oomph of Chain Reaction, Meldgaard's beats are too limp to push anyone around a dancefloor. You can rock back and forth to it. Maybe. But Victimizer differs just enough from the earlier Close Selections to justify its existence. Most notably, there are the peals of guitar that swell and sag like deflating balloons, the instrumental aftertaste of a goth record that's been abstracted to a handful of gestures. Vocals are dubbed until all that's left is the residue around the rim, a free floating vapor, or a low-res moan heard creepily through apartment walls. The bass continues to provide the barest possible forward momentum. But more than anything, Meldgaard is interested in bitmapping the mix until it nearly dissolves. It's no surprise that he has a history of playing in shoegaze bands before discovering techno, but his work as Mikkel Metal is hairy, shaggy, and dirty in a way that the candied guitars of shoegaze rarely were. If Swamp Thing got down, Victimizer would be his soundtrack.","Latest Kompakt release from a producer indebted to post-Basic Channel dub techno.

Would I Find Your Psychic Guideline,Horns of Happiness,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c194eb335119a49ed5a0/1:1/w_160/38172eaa.jpg,2006-03-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4036-would-i-find-your-psychic-guideline/,Secretly Canadian,"Horns of Happiness began as the lo-fi pop side project of Impossible Shapes' Aaron Deer, whose 2004 release A Sea as a Shore featured an array of instruments delivering a somewhat uneven group of songs. The addition of drummer Shelley Harrison, however, helps to make Would I Find Your Psychic Guideline more engaging. The six songs on this 12""-only release are hypnotic, cyclical affairs, relying on dense, fuzzy organ drones and simple, driving drumbeats. The arrangements are often simple-- typically featuring no more than two or three parts-- but the results are far from boring or generic. Organ and drums are the most prominent instruments utilized here-- although keyboard flourishes, strings, and guitars find their way in as well. Deer's pure, clean vocals are the perfect counter to the eerie, robotic sonics, but they're only featured on about half of the songs. As a result they become part of the mix in a unique way-- not by demanding your attention, despite their clarity, but by snaking their way through the tracks. ""Dowser Hunters"", the first instrumental in the every-other-song pattern of instrumental-to-vocal tracks, is like a dreamy circus theme, with a bouncy rhythm and low-mixed drums that combine to make it seem both jovial and creepy all at once. Unfortunately, it's difficult to identify the songs by their titles, as there seem to be six tracks, yet the tracklisting only includes five titles. Which of these six is the untitled one is a mystery. However, title or no, track five-- with ethereal swirling keyboard tones and quiet banjo plucking-- is the stronger of the record's other two instrumentals. The song lacks percussion, so the bass and keys wander without aim in a dizzying fashion. The album's brevity and vinyl-only release are its two biggest problems. Even though the hand-printed cover is nice (albeit fairly plain), I can't help but wonder if a CD release would fare better. The six songs on this EP top out at just over 20 minutes, meaning just as you're getting into the mesmerizing rhythm, it's over. Deer brought the layers and excess of A Sea as a Shore down to the basics, but now I find myself longing for more each time I listen.","Secretly Canadian issues this 12""-only, lo-fi side project from Impossible Shapes' Aaron Deer.

Dancing With Daggers,Magneta Lane,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54213d197565213bf8b/1:1/w_160/fe9f9c76.jpg,2006-03-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5636-dancing-with-daggers/,Paper Bag,"Magneta Lane's debut album is a case study in making the most of a limited musical vocabulary. As they demonstrated on their The Constant Lover EP two years ago, the band's sense of dynamics livens up its basic power trio setup, ensuring that the flowing choruses and pensive bridges stand out from the choppy verses, as well as keeping the basic minor key chord progressions fresh with rhythmic variety. If anything keeps Dancing With Daggers from equaling the EP, it's the lack of a genuine show-stopper like ""The Constant Lover"". ""Wild Gardens"" comes closest, rising out of a downtrodden verse on which vocalist Lexi Valentine's voice mingles with the fuzz guitar to a soaring chorus that manages to transform its melancholy vocal line into a sort of valediction through rhythm. And although nothing here tops that track, there are still plenty of other great, swooning melodies. Valentine sings long, slow melodies over frenetic strumming and frenzied, start-stop drumming on ""The Better Plan"", highlighting the natural mournfulness that comes through in her thick alto, a set of pipes that would have taken her far in the New Wave era. ""Artistic Condition"" explodes from quiet, high-tempo verses into a shimmering chorus featuring a guitar part strangely reminiscent of the Manic Street Preachers' ""No Surface All Feeling"", while Nadia King's drum part on opener ""Bridge to Terabithia"" never quite slips into a straight rhythm, instead letting the guitar and bass carry the song's central rhythmic thrust. The presence of Death From Above 1979's Jesse Keeler at the boards probably has something to do with the nastier fuzztones that coat the bass and guitar at various points in the album, but otherwise, the album is a natural beefing up of the sound of the EP, with occasional added organ or glockenspiel to accent the guitar parts. Considering that they're just now barely old enough to drink when they head south of the Canadian border to the U.S. (their age and the relative ease with which they procured a deal with Paper Bag produced some early, jealousy-fueled backlash from fellow musicians), they've developed an impressive sense of craft, and it seems they can only go up from here.","This Paper Bag-issued debut album is a case study in making the most of a limited musical vocabulary.

Lisbon,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa27c0084474cd0c1155/1:1/w_160/379905c0.jpg,2006-03-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8665-lisbon/,Kranky,"All art based in time has a trajectory. In music, consideration of trajectory is most crucial during long stretches of uninterrupted sound. Anything requiring attention for 20, 30, 40 minutes or more-- a DJ set, say-- needs a logical structure, a steady payout of inducements to encourage the listener to maintain focus. Listening to Lisbon, which documents an October 2005 performance at the Galeria Zé Dos Bois in the Portuguese capitol, I get the idea Keith Whitman has done some thinking about structure. Here he uses the tools (guitar, processed via computer) and palette (an emphasis on slowly shifting drone) first brought to bear on his 2002 album Playthroughs, and extends them to suit a long-form piece. The opening few minutes are close to ""Track3a (2waynice)"" from Playthroughs, with clean tendrils of drone only marginally more harmonically complex than a sine wave undulating in space like a Chinese dragon kite. Whitman gradually folds in additional layers and hints of counterpoint, from organ-like chords, soft bells, and an assortment of subtle glitches. The placid ramp upward lasts 13 minutes, and then harsh chords creep in. From there it's a steady plow into dissonance, as sheets of noise are piled on and most traces of pleasantness are left behind. Had it started somewhere heavier, the knotty bass (please don't listen on computer speakers) churning away at the 20-minute mark would have long grown tiring. But after the crystalline foundation of the piece's first quarter, the snarling ugliness proceeds with an undercurrent of poignancy, magnified emotionally through careful arrangement. Heard loud, filling a room, Lisbon can be a little overwhelming. The climax comes about three-fourths of the way in, around 27 minutes, where the gritty outer layer has been shed and the drone conjures images of a metaphysical ascension through clouds. A minute later, the engines cut out and it falls toward earth in a tumble of creaking furniture, blown fuses, and bent sprockets. Apparently, Whitman had microphones placed throughout the space to capture ambient noise, and he devised a patch to process it and add it to the mix. After the purely electronic immersion the live room sounds are jarring, but the piece quickly reassembles itself for a noisy sprint to the finish, with coarse sawtooth waves sparking fountains of harmonics. A wispy finish gives the piece a circular quality, ending very near the serene opening. It's a 41-minute piece that, like Fennesz' Live in Japan, doesn't make much sense cut into smaller segments. The time commitment is an obstacle, but the payoff is substantial. It comes back to the trajectory. When I picture a successful long-form laptop set, the perfect arc is something launched low-- 35 degrees, say-- with great force and a heavy wind coefficient so the piece dies quickly after reaching its expressive peak. Whitman here has followed it to the letter, constructing a riveting piece of music with the organic drama of a three-act play.","Picking up on the sound and palette of 2002's Playthroughs, the laptop hero presents a 41-minute piece recorded live during an October 2005 performance in the Portuguese capitol.

Not Alone,Various Artists,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8669d034d5c69bf3a2b/1:1/w_160/4af12b8b.jpg,2006-03-08 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2115-not-alone/,DurtroJnana,"Benefit albums tend to bring out the worst in music critics, prompting petty reviews in which we take labels to task for disseminating tawdry B-side packages under the guise of altruism. Either that, or we cast aside our grievances and compulsorily urge listeners to buy CDs for the children's sake, to save the rainforest, cure cancer, remember the 80s, whatever. Jnana's certainly not cutting me any slack on their critic-baiting Not Alone compilation: the dilemma has been compounded by five CDs, hordes of adorable out-rock virtuosos, deluxe packaging, and an eminently worthy cause (the African HIV/AIDS pandemic). Jesus, they even threw in a track by a Pitchfork contributor and pledged all the proceeds to Doctors Without Borders. This box is bulletproof. To lambaste it would be to insult human decency, and I refuse to be that one cynic who gave a 2.3 to the charitable saving-Africa set. Curators Mark Logan and David Tibet (Current 93) assembled a sterling cast of freaks, misanthropes, and free spirits: industrial deviants (Coil, Nurse With Wound), New Weird Americans (Fursaxa, Six Organs of Admittance), Japanese noise gods (Keiji Haino, Ghost), folk legends (Linda Perhacs, Pearls Before Swine), tape-loop loons (William Basinski) and everyone ever affiliated with Michael Gira. Oh, what the hell, let's also throw in Allen Ginsberg and Teenage Fanclub. The track organization leaves something to be desired, but there's a decisive novelty to owning a disc that features both folk-revivalist Dolly Collins and bible-shredder Aube. Strangely, there's also a smattering of mundane Canadian bar bands. Logan ""sequenced this set with the hope that folks will listen to each disc in its entirety,"" and one must stoically withstand the brief and goofy mediocrity on each disc. Nevertheless, there's at least three hours of quality material here, and the set mostly includes original and rare compositions. For a charity comp, the highlights are numerous and stubbornly experimental: On the introductory track, irr.app.(ext.) sets the standard with singular syntheses of finespun strums, Gregorian drones, wooden clocks, and Pan-Asian woodwinds. Mirror crafts glowing sinusoids, Eric Lanzillotta melts black-ice dub, and Tom Recchion spins reverberant neon vinyl over dust-covered choirs. Personal favorites include the Hafler Trio's elegant noise, Charlemagne Palestine's withering gales, and Cyclobe's enticing intersection of drilled flatulence and photon pong. But thoughts begin to wander somewhere around Hour 3, when the Bricoleur introduces his wind gyrations on ""Prah Pip Tah"". It's not a particularly dull piece, but the mind can only take outerworld spacescapes for so long. The more beat-based electronic music is also rather tepid (see Howie B.'s rote B-grade Blade noir or Edward Ka-Spel's confusing mix of glam vocals and 56k dial-up.) Countering this series of bleeps and found-sound scratches is the awkward camp of former Belle & Sebastian member Isobel Campbell, who adds more effete absurdity to ""The Beat Goes On"", and Sundial, who imagine that playing a garage version of the Osmond Brothers' ""Crazy Horses"" is the apex of revolutionary craftsmanship. Perhaps they feel obligated to propound pop schmaltz in the spirit of benefit albums. On the other end of the spectrum, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's truly bizarre ""Song for Doctors Without Borders"", a sort of anti-""We Are the World"", unites elements of the Bible and Faust. The other acoustic performers seem to take sides in the battle between psych-folk classics and protracted pseudo-grunge. But it's easy to simply ignore the latter in favor of Richard Buckner's ironclad rasp or Six Organs' solar-flare opium den. The sheer variety of songs is staggering, from Jarboe's belabored breathing to L's effortless Polynesian pixie dust. Even Ginsberg's ludicrous harmonium-and-viola Blake recitation seems pertinent to the proceedings. Simply put, Not Alone compiles a tremendous wealth of magnificent material, and there's something charming about listening to a doe-eyed charity endeavor by such infamous pessimists as Nurse With Wound and Current 93. Still, between the erratic sequencing and the handful of mediocrities, Not Alone often sounds like an assortment of free CDs from The Wire, albeit with marginally better quality control.","This 5xCD charity album, co-curated by David Tibet, benefits Doctors Without Borders and features contributions from Devendra Banhart, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Thurston Moore, Coil, Angels of Light, Six Organs of Admittance, Isobel Campbell, and Matmos, among others.

But even when especially plaintive, Richards' oft-operatic pipes are still recognizable: his breathy ups and downs-- accompanied by electronic artist, Alien8's Tim Hecker this time-- are nothing short of lovely, even sentimental and dimmed. If this smells like Postal Service, it isn't. The Richards/Hecker brand of electro-glum isn't techno-bumped, or over-blipped: It's bird calls and waterfalls and whistling-- the album's title track and opener, ""Purple Blaze"", foreshadows as much with its exhaled list of images, among them, ""the ordinary truth."" It's right on-- for the most part it's just Richards and that well-worn acoustic, the stuff of Simon and Garfunkel fanboydom-- but speaking of Jimi Hendrix (""Purple haze all in my brain/ Lately things just don't seem the same""), the world of Purple Blaze is some weird rainforesty, jungly one that's difficult to pinpoint exactly; it's hard to feel like you've ever completely gotten it, which doubles as both strength and shortcoming. There are missteps, most notably ""Run Up Wild on Me"", which is what would happen if Michael Jackson/Prince/Justin Timberlake inseminated triplets in the same hipsterette, and music-for-aromatherapy ""D Y C N"" and ""P L B Z"", which can't hold candles to the album highlights such as the chillingly gorgeous ""Daft Young Cannibals"" or ""Purple Blaze"". The majority of tracks fall squarely between transcendent and lacking-- stuff for café open mics, like the snored ""The Sleeparound"" and the partially whistled ""I Wish You Love Me"", aren't groundbreaking but pleasant enough. That ""finch"" Richards warns about in ""Purple Blaze"" turns up on ""Colonialism"", kamikaze chirping. Speaking of birds, the cover art's made to resemble a Penguin 20th Century Classic paperback: RIS PAUL RIC in caps, Purple Blaze italicized beneath it. Birds dream about their songs to better remember them in waking life, and in the end, this is what Purple Blaze seems like. In ""Hanging From the Grapevines"", Richards speaks of ""sending out songs beyond my control""; the chorus repeats itself till it's this perfect chant-- ""like the dream you won't remember""-- and that's just it: Purple Blaze is Ris Paul Ric's fragmented bird-dream recalled on too little sleeping, packing in Q and Not U's volatility, lacking only its pulled-togetherness, forecasting a wealth of good to come.","Former Q and Not U guitarist Chris Paul Richards is accompanied by Tim Hecker on this on his electroacoustic solo debut.

Was a time when The Bends-lites flickered like Nokia, but aside from ""You're Beautiful"" the Radiohead/Coldplay clone attack has been quiet on most fronts. Well, Norwegian singer/songwriter Even Johensen looks at Stars, sees how they shine. His second album under the Magnet moniker places Chris Martin's frail fix-yous amid slow, splashy MORtronica, kinda like Savage Garden posing as Canada's eighth-most-important band. On The Tourniquet, Stars' tourmate shares that deservedly celebrated band's mannered lushness. Power-popper Jason Falkner, of Jellyfish fame, lacquers the production just enough to keep the varied arrangements background-friendly. When someone tells Suj-fan about the banjos and hushed vocals of ""Duracellia"", he's not going to insult them, but the Specials might miss the slow guitar skank of murky ""All You Ask"". Still, somehow even the frequently employed strings, synths, and music-box tinkles don't muss the David Grayness of a basic palette-- warm keyboards, acoustic guitars 'n' beats-- that tries a bit too hard not to offend. Which is exactly why this disc can fill the post-Coldplay void on your mixtapes. After deceptively intricate verses that do their best to go unnoticed, the vaguely reassuring choruses leap out, as high-caloric as the afore-hinted James Blunt-- or Edwin McCain. ""You'll get through this if you hold on,"" Johensen sings on opener ""Hold On"", his throat catching just so before the song disintegrates into elegant but empty a cappella harmonies. ""You sing like an angel/ And I fall at your feet,"" goes a similarly overstated hook on ""Fall at Your Feet"", the one to YSI your unsuspecting beloved. Pretty much every chorus is as vapidly manipulative, from the swooning ""Miss Her So"" (Johensen: ""...and I can't let go"") to the equally massive ""Deadlock"", so that the album's only surprise, only conventionally bum note is following the Christopher Marlowe-esque ""Take my hand/ And I will follow"" with an awkward simile involving the album's title. Like much of X&Y;, Magnet is exceptionally unobtrusive, music to ignore: Falkner's gentle touches will never disturb yours, and Magnet's soft murmurs are as familiar as your computer's now-imperceptible hum. ""I'm gonna do this my own way...I might as well believe in me,"" Johensen sings, echoing John Lennon, and he has covered both Dylan and Cash. So why's he so intent on becoming a more lavish Keane?","Norwegian singer/songwriter Even Johensen is the latest in the long line of The Bends/Coldplay worshippers.

On the way, the Markers have also found time to issue their righteously chaotic Ecstatic Peace album I Trust My Guitar, Etc. in addition to the obligatory slew of homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. But to this point the group's recorded output has resembled a series of blurred snapshots of a massive, writhing serpent-- with each occasional glimpse of fang, tongue, or rattle obscured in a cloud of furious, scaly motion. And so it continues on their latest sustained leap into the void, A Panegyric to the Things I Do Not Understand, an album that yet again faithfully captures the trio's brutal sonics in all their impulsive, erratic splendor. Panegyric is the first of the Markers' works to see an official CD release, and as such it showcases a corresponding (if incremental) progress in recording fidelity. Mastered by kindred spirit Matt Valentine, the album still maintains the appearance of a live document, particularly in the inchoate gush of Elisa Ambrogio's hyper-charged, extemporaneous vocals. If there was any significant post-production sweetening it wasn't particularly effectual, as the album is split into two equal-length tracks-- the California side and the Paris side-- each of which unfolds with the halting, asymmetric momentum of an especially turbulent real-time event. When spouting at peak efficiency, Magik Markers are able to incorporate an astonishing breadth of influence into their mulching, free-rock hysteria. At base level, the group operates in a fertile vein of unaffiliated Harry Pussy/Dead C noise, but with a further emphasis on pure, low-octane garage thud. Panegyric also contains the echoes of everything from standard No Wave scribbling to the free-blasting improvisations of Sonny and Linda Sharrock, to the burlesque dementia of Suckdog. Much of this exhaustive versatility can be credited to drummer Pete Nolan, who can return the most outward-bound clatter instantly to a tribal, Godz-like primitivism. Ambrogio and bass guitarist Lea Quimby both sound in fine fettle as well, with Elisa's manic exhortations on the first track eventually devolving into an extended passage of collective subhuman whistles, chirps and grunts. More recent pre-histories are explored on the second track, as Ambrogio's prolonged, fervent rap makes lyrical reference to AC/DC, Patti Smith, and the MC5, perhaps in an implicit attempt to secure a place for Magik Markers in that heady pro-rock lineage. Despite the Markers' obvious talent for spontaneous invention and their deceptively ambitious reach, however, their work still contains far too many hesitant passages that in quainter times might've been worked out in the rehearsal room. (And would it kill them to give Nolan's drums proper authority in the mix, or for Elisa to refrain from straying off-mic in mid-verse?) Sporadically triumphant though it is, this Panegyric remains too studded with false leads and curious periods of inaction to truly rank as the all-devouring, avant-rock juggernaut that the trio appears capable of someday delivering.","After a slew of cassettes and homemade CD-Rs this is the first CD release for the volcanic post-hardcore trio.

One vector leads here, to slender, interwoven strands of drone braided from processed guitar, vibraphone, and assorted electronics. A first listen to this kind of minimalism brings to mind questions of purity. One wonders just how tightly the beam of sound will be focused, whether the music will exist exclusively on a long thin wire, fully accessible only with magnification. What sort of commitment will it take to follow the changes, sense the development, and hear what's really going on? In the case of Chihei Hatakeyama, releasing his first solo album after a number of collaborations with like-minded Tokyo improvisers, the answer to the question of purity is ""not so pure, really."" Hatakeyama uses the palette of the True Drone Believers but he seeds his overstretched chords with easy pleasures. It's in the way the monolithic chord with harmonics like a pipe organ fills the first two minutes of ""Swaying Curtain in the Window"", only to slowly dissolve into a tinkling music box melody and, finally, clouds of acoustic guitar picking. So while the processed whine of ""Bonfire on the Field"" evokes the exquisite singularity of Keith Whitman's Playthroughs system, ""Towards a Tranquil Marsh"" combines that mediation on the held tone with a relaxed tune and identifiable chords, a campfire song from a planet with two suns. Throughout Minima Moralia, Hatakeyama thinks of sound as vibration first, but conventional ideas about when such movement becomes music quickly come into play. It's true, yes, a number of musicians are already working his ground, but Hatakeyama has his own voice. There's a distance here that develops in part from the music's deep undercurrent of calm. Weighed against the delicacy and surface-level charm is an odd sense of remove that keeps the music from becoming overly sentimental. And you never get the sense that something surprising lurks around the corner, which might strike some as a negative but to me gives the music a greater sense of expansiveness. Only on the closing ""Beside a Well"" does any real dissonance creep in, as Hatakeyama gradually piles on distortion until his music finally crosses over into places covered by Tim Hecker and, more recently, Belong. A hint, maybe, of where his music might one day go; in any event, he's off to an excellent start.","Japanese minimalist issues his first solo album after a number of collaborations with like-minded Tokyo improvisers.

I dare you to even work it into casual conversation, without someone thinking that you're alluding to Sammy Hagar or Tom Cochrane or David Brent. The heinous phrase is code, I hope, for a classified ad that Coxon should have already placed: LYRICIST WANTED. WILL PAY IN NME AWARDS. Love's already a battlefield, and the drug, and hurts, and will tear us apart, but did you know that it also broke the speed limit? Coxon's latest contains a pretty sweet almost-hour of idea-less rock on which he sounds less like a veteran than an upstart. To obligatorily bring up the old war: Anyone who cherished how the last Oasis record triumphantly channeled the energy of that band's ancestors should enjoy this homage to the roots of Blur. Always a tad tighter and less daft than their Stones-baiting rivals, the Blur co-helmed by Coxon owed a debt to 45s that came out between the peak of the Who knockoff glut up until right before Manchester ""happened."" Thus this quaintly brash album stomps into the retroturf of bands referred to sniggeringly as the Pistols and the 'Cocks. (Spiked leather restraints, and this album's clunky ballads, are keeping me from typing a Punklife pun.) Contradiction city: These are drinking songs, sadistically, from an artist famously on the wagon. The titles and lyrics are 90% cliché, but Coxon makes them poignant via the refrain (on ""Don't Believe Anything I Say"") of ""I'll be thinking about these words forever,"" which seems as much an admission of writer's block as it does a taunt about being purposefully direct, even if it results in sounding (ewww) conventional. The power-pop is so deliberately rigid-- its Townsend is jagged and even its jangle is abrupt-- that iPodded variety-addicts might long for an interval with Doherty's huh-we-taping? shambles. And why in the world is a rugged flashback record hosting adult contemporary saxomophone-jam ""Flights in the Sea (Lovely Rain)""? So you've outlived Jesus and have a wonderful daughter, Mr. Coxon; congrats-- no need to go all ""mature"" on us. Pardon my statesideism, but he sounds like a British David Lowery. No, wait, he sounds like the Rentals when they ""went British"" for that second album. Except he's pissed off and backed by big nasty organs on the disappointment-addicted ""You Always Let Me Down"". Except he's either homoerotically covetous or angry at younger models on ""What's He Got"": ""Got a brown leather jacket and tight blue jeans/ Wears a pair of Beatle boots just like me."" If I may stoop to tabloid conjecture, doesn't the first line, ""Saw you on the corner by the cash machine"" suggest that Hard-Fi are among his targets? A buoyant guitarist has gotten over abstraction, which makes life momentarily difficult for his haymaking critics. The slightness of this album is hard to hold a grudge against, but ain't nothing oh-my-god necessary about it either. ""Gimme Some Love"", for example, is one of the dumber things that an artist can command, but damn if Coxon doesn't demand it riotously and convincingly.","Like his underrated Happiness in Magazines, the latest from the former Blur guitarist is more accessible guitar pop than art-rock.

Fab Four Suture,Stereolab,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56b9d034d5c69bf32c3/1:1/w_160/48a07626.jpg,2006-03-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7505-fab-four-suture/,Beggars BanquetToo Pure,"Let's talk about reductionism, shall we? There is a notion that one way to find truth is to peer ever closer at things until you start noticing their constituent parts, and breaking them up into groups of increasingly smaller parts until you get to the one part that doesn't break. The thinking goes that whatever you can discern about this smallest essence is the most basic, universal truth about whatever it is you're looking at: Think sub-atomic particles in physics, or anytime you hear someone talk about their fave ""desert island"" records. These are supposed represent the prime, most important kernels of our musical tastes, and if you remove them from the equation, we're fundamentally different. I was listening to Stereolab the other day, wondering how they might ""reduce."" Even more than most bands, their music seemed dependent on being more than the sum of its parts-- especially given the general consistency in their sound for so many years. Looking closer, I can break down individual albums as either good or bad, but that's a little too general (and many fans will tell you that they've yet to actually produce a ""bad"" album). So, I can go down to the songs, and say whether or not they work-- but then I lose the picture of the albums as a whole. Hmm, so maybe I should actually go down further, and see if the songs on each album share something-- perhaps an instrumental similarity, or a melodic element in common-- but I find that rather than bring me closer to an overarching truth about the band, I end up with dozens more questions than when I started. And I'm not exactly sure how any of this relates to the emotional rush I get from them at their best. As Stereolab's 10th full-length, Fab Four Suture, makes clear, there is an extremely thin line between revealing your essence and revealing nothing at all. Although it sounds exactly like a latter day 'Lab album should sound (there I go trying to break down again), I find it maddeningly hard to tell you why except in terms so basic that they're almost totally useless: Laetitia Sadier still sings like Laetitia Sadier; the Farfisa still sounds like a Farfisa; the songs still sound like exotica spliced with sunshine psychedelia and krautrock. That last point may sound like I'm giving you some good, hard info-- but remember that it applies to just about every other Stereolab album as well. Overall, I'm less taken by this record than, say, last year's Margerine Eclipse or 2001's Sound-Dust, but am having a bitch of a time deciding why. So, let's reduce a bit, starting with the songs. Out of 12, I can only hear a few that would stand out on previous records. The book-ending, two-parted tracks ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" are models of efficiency and refinement, and sound like golden milk pouring down out of the same blue sky that gave us the Beach Boys' ""'Til I Die"" and Philip Glass's great early piece Music in 12 Parts. Minimalism never sounded so pretty, all stuffed with harmony vocals and a heavenly chord progression. ""Get a Shot of the Refrigerator"" isn't quite as distinctive, but does do some nifty tricks with the beat, showcasing a particularly funky side of the band at the bridge. Conversely, there are lots of songs that seem interchangeable with dozens of others in Stereolab's catalog: ""Eye of the Volcano"", with cooing Marxism from Sadier and trombone counterpoint is Cobra & Phases redux; ""Vodiak"" is more energetic, but the melody and harmony accompaniment are textbook for the band, and the up-tempo groove could have fit in unnoticed on Mars Audiac Quintet or ETK. Analog-synth heavy tunes like ""Widow Weirdo"" or ""Plastic Mile"" seem like outtakes from 2000's First of the Microbe Hunters, itself an EP that sounded stuffed of outtakes. But the question is if the worst I can say about Fab Four is that it sounds too much like Stereolab, how can it be bad? I mean, I like Stereolab! The crux of reductionism is that it never actually adds up to the whole picture. Fab Four Suture doesn't inspire me because I rarely actually have to hear it-- stepping back, my ears tell me that I have, in fact, already heard it countless times before. The songs don't so much flow into each other, as exist as vague siblings, joining hands if not necessarily contributing to a higher bond. There is nothing intrinsically bad about it of course, but the album is consumed by the already menacingly ""not intrinsically bad""-ness of their canon. Stereolab have produced more good music than most bands I know, but over time, I'm coming to the realization that it isn't necessarily localized in any one place. That makes it hard to recommend any particular Stereolab album over another, much less Fab Four, but it also leaves the band a perpetually open door for fans.","Veteran band's 10th full-length makes clear that there is an extremely thin line between revealing your essence and revealing nothing at all.

Where the Grass Grows Black,The Society of Rockets,by: John Motley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69c9d034d5c69bf359a/1:1/w_160/dab9f614.jpg,2006-03-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7800-where-the-grass-grows-black/,Underpop,"Postmodern player-haters be damned. Even if the only path to creating something new is playing cut-and-paste with pre-existing styles and genres, it hasn't all been done before. Exhibit A: Stephen McBean's Pink Mountaintops and Black Mountain projects, which stitch together instantly recognizable references and proudly wear them on their sleeves. But in McBean's case, there's always a singular songwriter behind the pastiche, anchoring the music with something weightier than the sum of its influences. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for San Francisco's Society of Rockets. For their sophomore effort, Where the Grass Grows Black, the band sheds the subdued shoegaze of its debut for an unconvincing hodgepodge of classic rock flavors. The album oozes with nostalgia and a sense of uncanny familiarity, but it never rises far above homage. And even if it's stacked with high-octane rock and irrepressible melody, the Rockets draw so liberally from classic sources, there are hardly any surprises. On opener ""Tangerines & Cigarettes"", the Rockets get their sticky fingers all over 70s-era Stones brass sections. ""Out in the Evening"" saunters up with all the swagger of T. Rex boogie. And ""DrX"" strays a short distance from the classic rock playbook: It's a bluesy take on the Jesus and Mary Chain, embellished with some chaotic Ron Asheton licks. But rather than using these stylistic touchstones as building blocks to construct something all its own, the Rockets seem content to settle for a kind of classic rock paint-by-numbers act. The best moments on Where the Grass Grows Black are when the band revisits the lulling and elegiac tone of Sunset Homes. ""Suicide Summer"" is a velvety two-chord dirge backed by restrained floor toms. Bandleader Joshua Babcock leads a call-and-response vocal, cataloging a summer's worth of ""small suicides""-- from the banal (""all the dishes in the sink"") to the nauseatingly starry-eyed (""all the broken believers""). These exchanges build slowly before they segue into a chorus of soaring harmonies and crisp cymbal crashes. The last two songs find the Rockets sounding more like itself than a cover band. With its warm organ tones, reverb-soaked vocals and sustained strings, ""The Longest Mile You'll Ever Walk"" is the album's most ethereal song-- and one that, frustratingly, lasts less than two minutes. On the obligatory epic closer, ""Old Glory"", the Rockets finally use the sonic elements of the album to forge an individual sound. After an intro in which meandering horn phrases snake around each other, the band launches into its most languorous number, providing a more fitting backdrop for Babcock's delicate vocals (despite his ham-fisted anti-war lyrics). It's a relief for the listener and a revelatory moment for the band, as if it had to endure an album's worth of false steps and classic rock copycatting to carve out a space to call its own.","San Francisco band's sophomore album sheds the subdued shoegaze of its debut for a hodgepodge of classic rock flavors.

Ahead of the Lions,Living Things,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf95e6ef95969323199/1:1/w_160/c465db24.jpg,2006-03-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5004-ahead-of-the-lions/,Jive,"I feel weird reviewing this CD because I grew up near these guys in St. Louis and was kind of beguiled by them. The Berlin brothers lived in the manse on the hill above a huge apartment complex for divorcees. Some of the frustrated single-parent-household kids would beat up Eve, Bosh, and Lillian for delivering newspapers while wearing tight pants and makeup and for working as parking lot attendants while being lean and groovy and speaking in elliptical rants that referenced Voltaire and Iggy Pop. One Halloween, they went trick-or-treating dressed as T. Rex and got pummeled by some kids dressed as AC/DC. I remember hearing that Bosh and Eve wanted to go back for revenge, but Lillian told them that absorption was a better tactic: ""We'll just sop that whole proletariat choad-rock thing into our androgynous interplanetary millionaire shtick."" Okay, I made that up, but I had to, because the Living Things CD was playing, and not enough was going on with that to keep me entertained. Their energy, ambition, and audible influences, should have congealed for a knockout-- imagine the Reid brothers and Wayne Kramer uniting to form JAMC5, but hoping for radio play in the 90s. Steve Albini's recordings balance the crunch and the polish. The political lyrics are even grounded in theology (a la Dylan) to keep them from fading with the headlines. But this band that tries to be everything ends up seeming like a cipher. Maybe the Living Things' combination of sincere poses is coming too soon after the ripple of ironic hard-rock bands? Opener ""Bombs Below"" employs a vintage choral fist-pumpy chant that Electric Six used semi-satirically on both of their albums, right before solos done in similar guitar tones. Maybe people are momentarily finding the glitz-retro clones not much different than Elvis impersonators or Civil War re-enactors? Dopey simulacra abound; every bar scene contains a group of pretty enough dudes who are to Mott the Hoople what a McDonalds Playland is to Walt Disney World. Maybe the Los Angeles circuit inspires bands to perform with a hyperdramatic larger-than-lifeness that's hard to swallow? I just saw She Wants Revenge prance and leer and sway beyond the honey-mustard quotidian fringe in which most of us earn our rent, and I was praying for a life-size savior, even if life looked like, well, A.C. Newman. I really want to cheer their political anthems, but currently, ""glam"" and ""international conflict"" bring up Gary Glitter's indiscretions with Vietnamese tweens on my brain's Google Image search. Besides, party riffs have already been paired with anti-establishment gospel manifestoes by the Make Up, and war-on-terror already got the seventies-rawk treatment by Bobby Conn. Neither of those bravura acts won the chance to perform on all the late shows. Nor did they get a Cingular commercial for a two year-old album that, bless its heart, went through three major labels and two releases. (Ahead of the Lions is masterfully sequenced; the one-trick party moves along more smoothly than the nine of these songs did on 2004's Black Skies in Broad Daylight.) I kept thinking that these guys would blow up late like the Counting Crows did, giving this review a semi-relevant sheen, but I have a feeling that record store clerks somewhere are building girlfriends out of Living Things promos, the way I used to with a stack of August & Everything Afters before the sudden popularity of ""Mr. Jones"" ended the dream. Fans of handclaps, who don't mind that Berlin sings as many lines about doing lines as he does protest lines, marching lines and battle lines, will have fun pretending to be epic along with these Velvet Ramones.","Imagine the Reid brothers and Wayne Kramer uniting to form JAMC5, but hoping for radio play in the 90s.

O True Believers,James Blackshaw,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b1b1335d7bf1698a0e/1:1/w_160/2d0b2c03.gif,2006-03-06 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1197-o-true-believers/,Important,"In recent months, 23-year-old UK guitarist James Blackshaw has burst fully-formed onto the folk underground, his remarkable talents already seeming at peak maturity. Over the course of a handful of limited-edition LP's and CD-R's, Blackshaw has established himself as an instrumentalist of astonishing grace and delicacy, seeming as though he's gobbled and digested whole the primitive folk canons of Takoma and Vanguard. Relying primarily on 12-string guitar, Blackshaw's intricate creations web together Robbie Basho's wayfaring mysticism, Ben Chasny's soft-focused acid tongues, and the rustic fantasias of Sandy Bull. Blackshaw's latest release O True Believers is his best-sounding and most complete work yet; its every dazzling figure cast in amber sunbeams as his playing moves in a decidedly baroque direction, his compositional engines laboring to outpace his nimble fingers. The slight imbalance between Blackshaw's skills as a composer and those as a guitarist are most noticeable on the album's opening convocation ""Transient Life in Twilight"". Utilizing a thick, John Fahey-like open tuning, this lengthy piece has a circular, repetitive construction that fixes attention on Blackshaw's nearly inhuman dexterity. As the track gathers momentum, his immaculate playing achieves a cascading, harp-like complexity, sounding almost as if Blackshaw has the ability to lift and strum a small harpsichord. Impressive though his playing his, however, the 11-minute track feels a fraction overlong as it reiterates its simple melody with a single-minded concentration that suggests Blackshaw might be perfectly content to continue on indefinitely. Even longer is the album's 18-minute centerpiece ""The Elk With Jade Eyes"", but here Blackshaw has wisely chosen to branch out instrumentally, adding elements of sitar, harmonium, and hand percussion to the track's crystalline wells. This rapturous epic unfurls with a patient, snake-charming grandeur. Blackshaw hammers his guitar like an Appalachian dulcimer one minute, and tenderly plucks it like a Renaissance lute the next to craft his utterly singular cross-traditional tapestry. The track's evocative, otherworldly spirit lingers on the following ""Spiraling Skeleton Memorial"", which has the intoxicating languor of a late evening gondola serenade. On the set-closing title track, a lilting chorus is carried by what is credited as harmonium but sounds as much like a wistful melodica. Rippling with chimes and percussion, this irresistible song is as close as Blackshaw gets to conforming to a standard pop structure, and by this evidence he shows an effortless knack for more straightforward melodic forms. Right now the field for folk-based guitarists is becoming crowded with unique and exceptional talents-- Chasny, Jack Rose, Matt Valentine, Richard Bishop-- so Blackshaw's greatest obstacle at this point might simply be listener fatigue. Yet as the radiant O True Believers illustrates, Blackshaw is able to differentiate himself through his exotic lyricism, stray pan-ethnic flourishes and pure unmasked virtuosity, while his youth suggests he's only just begun to tap his true capabilities.","UK folk-based guitarist fits nicely alongside exceptional talents such as Ben Chasny, Jack Rose, Matt Valentine, and Richard Bishop.

Fear Is on Our Side,I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99aeb335119a49ec80a/1:1/w_160/d7682cc1.jpg,2006-03-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4151-fear-is-on-our-side/,Secretly Canadian,"Indie rock, as practiced by genre heavyweights like Pavement and Pixies, is often marked by a certain artful goofiness, from Stephen Malkmus' deliberately ham-handed classic rock revisions to Frank Black's spastic vocal delivery. In this milieu, songs can simply be collections of broad ironic/iconic gestures; guitar solos are simultaneously hilarious and awesome; lyrics may consist of little more than a series of in-jokes and cheeky allusions. It's irreverent, indifferently erratic in style, and goes to great measures to show it doesn't take itself too seriously. I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness belongs to a different genus of indie rock, one that I mentally file as S.I.R., or ""Serious Indie Rock."" Exemplified by bands like Interpol, Calla, and, to an extent, grandiose yet traditionally narrative post-rock outfits like Explosions in the Sky, this style of indie eschews irony, pop culture trawling, and genre hopscotch. It's reverent, recondite, and stylistically consistent. Fear Is on Our Side, ILYBICD's full-length follow-up to their promising debut EP, has the S.I.R. aesthetic dead to rights. The band's nominal choices demonstrate a penchant for mannered esotericism. The record cover is black, decorated only with a blue heart/inverted cross logo of ambiguous meaning but massive branding potential. The vocals, even when they become impassioned, are as remote as distant stars. The lyrics are grand in tone but minimal in content; devoid of humor and rhetorical flourish they pass by almost unnoticed in the music's grey gleam. The guitars shimmer, echo, and press relentlessly upward, but with an elegant museum quality, hermetically sealed in glass cases. The songs are uniformly rigid and linear, resistant to areas of slippage or the happy accident, minutely sculpted until their evocative power becomes almost clinical. If there's a sterility to ILYBICD's music, it's counterbalanced by the commanding presence with which it imbues the songs, gracing them with the familiar yet persistently stimulating impact of film-trailer voiceovers. You know your emotional state is being deliberately manipulated-- of course you do; it's what you paid for. ""The Ghost"" slinks along with a precise accumulation of majestic gestures-- a chiming guitar dirge and an ominous synth drone, an outsized elastic bassline, emphatically punchy tempo shifts, lugubrious vocals in barely differentiated harmony, long repetitive arcs of concisely ascending chords. ""According to Plan"" threads silvery filaments of guitar through a goose-stepping fuzz bassline and rigid yet splashy drums. ""We Choose Faces"" lays a tight, trebly coil of guitar atop a pillowy piano phrase before the rhythm section asserts structural integrity. An aspect of S.I.R. that I've yet to address is its propensity to be most affecting at the moments when it comes unbuttoned, relaxing its rhythmic and stylistic rigor. On Interpol's debut, this moment came with ""NYC"", where Paul Banks's voice drifted over a strum that was loose and jangly compared to the streamlined contours of the record proper. For ILYBICD, the moment comes with ""Today"", graced with all the inspiring incandescence of the Smashing Pumpkins song with which it shares a name, and bringing the Explosions in the Sky comparison above fully into play. Pneumatic percussion respires like a living thing; a stately procession of ringing guitars and expansively woozy synths flows around the prayerful vocals; a mammoth bassline shows up fashionably late and joins the crisply intensifying percussion in flogging the song toward a dazzling crescendo. If the bulk of the album is for the car, the bar, the social occasion, then moments like this are for headphones, bedrooms, intimate and solitary states. The presence of both increases the breadth of this assured LP, and establishes ILYBICD as being no longer a band to watch, but a band to listen to.","On its anticipated debut Secretly Canadian LP, this indie band embraces a reverent, recondite, and stylistically consistent sound.

Fox Confessor Brings the Flood,Neko Case,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5379d034d5c69bf3250/1:1/w_160/e178555e.jpg,2006-03-06 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1325-fox-confessor-brings-the-flood/,EpitaphAnti-,"The voice looms larger than ever. It's almost unfair. Draped in luscious, acute reverb, every phrase is granted its own pitch-perfect spotlight, and each precious syllable stands alone as a singular accomplishment. On Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, Neko Case's peerless cries crash through the mix with unprecedented force, their natural grandeur captured in sonorous surround sound. But it's not all about the voice; songs are important, too. Case's lungs-for-days Dollywood boom may be as direct an emotional instrument as there is in contemporary music, but her increasingly prominent songwriting skills tend to eschew visceral connections for intellectual intrigue and poetic mystery-- and Flood features Case's most cryptic lyrics to date. The odd disconnect here between singer and songwriter is absorbing: Though shaded by finely-tuned, country-noir twang, the rapturous belter's high-minded lyrical aspirations often undermine her throat's unhindered veracity. Given her former life as an art-school punk, Case's increasingly independent, non-traditional songwriting trajectory isn't totally surprising. Moving from the countrified mix of covers and originals of her solo debut, 1997's The Virginian, to 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby, which featured mostly originals co-written by Case, to 2002's Blacklisted, on which the singer wrote most of the alluringly bluesy songs on her own, Case's musical ambitions have evolved and taken greater definition with each successive album. Flood finds Case continuing to write the lion's share of her material, while also producing and mixing. Appropriately, it's a logical extension of the themes, instrumentation, and mood of Blacklisted. Long gone are the relatively straightforward Furnace-era break-up laments with their simple-yet-effective couplets like, ""Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', how can you forget/ All the love we had between us, now it's like we never met."" Removing herself from many of the album's David Lynch-like narratives, Case often embraces the role of omnipotent storyteller. One such twisty tale is the harrowing rich-girl/poor-girl opener, ""Margaret Vs. Pauline"". Strolling alongside a frolicking, Jon Brion-esque piano, wordy descriptors and odd details inform a striking gap between the song's haunting title pair. Describing the blessed beauty Pauline, Case sings, ""And they placed an ingot in her breast to burn cool and collected/ Fate holds her firm in its cradle and then rolls her for a tender pause to savor."" Lines like that don't roll off with ease, but within the scheme of the album, they can add up to something palpably uncomfortable-- a vague, inescapable sense of loss. Confessional only in the most roundabout sense, Case's songs set up strange anecdotal skeletons that beg listeners to connect the dots between. ""Star Witness"" may be about a car accident, a shooting, a deep love wiped away, or all of those things. Bound together by an awe-inspiring, harmony-laden hook, the swaying waltz may seem like free-associating farce at first, but subsequent exposures offer slight turns. There's no right answer to ""Star Witness"", but its keen open-endedness is an appealing destination in itself. Such complex examples of Case's unique songwriting string theory abound, from the ghostly, near-a cappella ""A Widow's Toast"", to the quasi-political, fable-based title track, to ""Dirty Knife"", a haunted-house elegy to madness. Each track relies on a starkly defined bleakness to guide its queasy understanding of an existence between the bitter end and its sometimes-sweeter aftermath. What once again prevents Case from delivering a front-to-back classic is a perfectionist streak that accounts for Flood's mannered meticulousness. A nice-enough reinterpretation of traditional folk spiritual ""John Saw That Number"" rumbles along amiably but Case can't adequately summon the spontaneous affectations that the gospel-style track requires to truly transcend. Though she often cites churchly touchstone Bessie Griffin as a guiding influence, it seems as if Case's hard-line precision rarely allows her to encapsulate Griffin's untethered style and act in the moment. Such flawless phrasing can cause songs to become too treasurable, as if they're off-limits, encrusted under a thick glass casing. Still, nobody today does eerie dust-bowl balladry and anachronistic rustic-murder milieu quite like Case. Combining country, folk, and old-school rock, she faithfully invokes scenes of late-night wandererings illuminated by a jalopy's lone functional headlight. As a refined version of Blacklisted, Flood provides alluring riddles and obsessive desolation, Case subverting her easy-access vocals with difficult abstractions and heady projections. Yet, after fishing through Flood's 12 intricate tracks, a plainspoken love song delivered in that voice would not be unwelcome.","The gifted singer's musical ambitions continue to evolve and take shape; here she removes herself from David Lynch-like narratives and embraces the role of omnipotent storyteller.

Below the Branches,Kelley Stoltz,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57c5e6ef95969320af2/1:1/w_160/9073ba08.jpg,2006-03-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7522-below-the-branches/,Sub Pop,"For his previous album, San Francisco musician Kelley Stoltz wrote all the songs and recorded all the instruments. Finding himself with no label, he simply pressed a few hundred copies onto vinyl and sold them at local record stores. For his new album, Below the Branches, he had some help, not just the guest musicians who play on these songs, but also an interested record label, namely Sub Pop. So it seems particularly odd that for all the time and sweat Stoltz has put into this music, there's no sense of a real person behind these songs, just a tightly wound bundle of ideas borrowed from likely pop sources. ""Ever Thought of Coming Back"" begins with Beach Boys harmonies that are almost litigiously similar to ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""Memory Collector"" relies on idyllic recollections much like those on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, and ""Wave Goodbye"" and ""Birdies Singing"" capture some of the goofier aspects of the Beatles. On the other hand, far too many songs evoke solo Lennon, solo McCartney, and solo Harrison (unsurprisingly, I don't detect very much solo Starr). These aren't exactly adventurous touchstones, and Below the Branches comes off as too reverent and polite, as if Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are holy texts. But the popular canon he plugs into never feels very personal to Stoltz; something unexpected might have broken this impersonal spell-- perhaps some of the New Wave he channeled on his song-for-song cover album of Echo & the Bunnymen's Crocodiles, for example. ""Find a thing that makes you happy,"" Stoltz sings on ""Wave Goodbye"". ""Find a thing that gets you high."" Below the Branches shows he's found his thing. The care with which he's fashioned and recorded these songs is as obvious as the influences, and while affectionate perfectionism doesn't guarantee listenability (in fact, it often precludes it), in this case craft is the album's saving grace. Stoltz's attention to sonic detail ensures the choruses are catchy when they're supposed to be catchy, the tempos jaunty when they're supposed to be jaunty, the mood dark or sunny whenever it's supposed to be either dark or sunny. The keyboard fanfare that kicks off ""Summer's Easy Feeling"" quickly and neatly transforms into a contemplative motif as the tempo picks up. ""Memory Collector"" has what sounds like an impromptu mouth trumpet solo, and ""Words"" descends on a meditative keyboard crawl that creates a curiouser and curiouser mood. Alas, nothing much comes of it before song's end. But don't read that hollowness the wrong way. Stoltz is a pop universalist, and on Below the Branches, he seems willing to absent himself so that the listener can become the focus, so the music can speak for whomever hears it instead of whomever makes it. I'm not sure this approach works as well as it could-- emptiness is emptiness, regardless of its intentions-- but Below the Branches seems nevertheless genuinely and generously deferential, a tip of the hat to whomever's on the other end of the artist/audience equation. The caveat is that listeners may never hear nearly as much in these songs as Stoltz does.","San Francisco musician's self-contained Sub Pop debut is a tightly wound bundle of familiar pop ideas.

Gipsy Freedom,Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab15e6ef95969321624/1:1/w_160/2eeda68e.jpg,2006-03-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8799-gipsy-freedom/,5RC,"A lonesome trail of warm, bleating saxophone and the faintly audible, clammy click of keys opens Brooklyn-based ensemble Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice's fifth proper full-length, Gipsy Freedom. As smoky melodies form from the curling, resonant notes, Heidi ""White Diamond"" Diehl's theatrical vocals declare, ""Peace is a phoenix right out of the sky."" Each word, delivered with Diehl's unique character and emphasis, drops like a pin through the mist of separated notes, pulling them together into a melee of skeletal structures. Gipsy Freedom is mostly configured from mosaics of folk-influenced guitar and a series of other less distinct instruments. But like all of WWVV's recordings to date-- the group shares the present noise/experimental scene's dedication to prolificacy, having produced a striking number of cassettes and CDRs in addition to their more widely available releases-- Gipsy Freedom departs from the band's previous work. The acoustic loveliness of The Flood, for example, is less articulated; instead, the band takes strides toward broken and fractured jazz, which frees them to experiment with a broader range of space and sound. An instrumental wash of bass and flute provides the foundation for improv track ""Hey Pig He Stole My Sound""; it's quickly embellished with the rickety twinkle of bells and clattering cymbals. ""Don't Love the Liar"", perhaps the most traditionally structure song here, forms around a bony kickdrum and prowling bassline. Perhaps best serving as an example of what Wooden Wand choose not to do on this album, the track flickers out less than two minutes in. Of course, there's also ample evidence of the band's strong roots in noise music (original member Tovah O'Rourke comprises half of Dead Machines with husband John Olsen of Wolf Eyes): ""Dead End Days with Caesar"", though not of Prurient/Wolf Eyes school of ear-splitting torture, is a 20-odd-minute avant-garde jamboree, thick with jaunty rhythms and contact mic explosions. Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice have managed to maintain a delightful sense of mystery thus far: From their website's far-flung but not entirely convincing biography (apparently, their history embraces Czech runaways, traveling carnivals, and childhood literary prodigies) to their quasi-mythical stage names (Satya Sai Kali Jehovah, Glucas Nonhorse Crane, etc.), the band clearly enjoys building their mystique, thriving in an ambiguous, hypnotic make-believe world.

Under a Billion Suns,Mudhoney,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c405eb335119a49ed857/1:1/w_160/4e8e5e14.jpg,2006-03-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5495-under-a-billion-suns/,Sub Pop,"Here's one more thing folks can blame on the Dubya Administration: the political awakening of Mudhoney. That's right, the group that spent nearly 20 years giving the flannel finger to the world is now putting on its best po-face and dropping bon mots like, ""I want a world run by giant brains/ Instead of small-minded arrogant fools."" That not-so-quotable moment comes from Under a Billion Suns opener ""Where Is the Future"", a five-minute treatise on the qualitative gulf between 1960s science fiction and 21st century science fact that an earlier version of the group might have titled, ""Dude, Where's My Bubble Car?"" Sadly, this ain't your older brother's (...father's?!) Mudhoney. Over the course of the album, listeners learn that we killed the Kennedys (""It Is Us""), being middle class means never having to apologize for taking out a second mortgage (""Empty Shells""), and war does actually suck (""Hard-On for War""). In case it isn't clear, we are now officially out of grace. Mark Arm's voice is the perfect conduit for withering one-liners and bathroom-wall rejoinders, the Gen X lingua franca that still carries plenty of cachet. As the voice of the people that live for ""The Daily Show"" and dreamed of Fitzmas, he's a great sandwich artist. What makes these weak attempts at earnestness all the more disappointing is that the music is great. Mudhoney are still in love with the three B's-- Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, and Big Muff-- but the group showers its loves with flattering arrangements and accoutrements. The horns that popped up on Mudhoney's last record (Since We've Become Translucent) return to make tasteful cameos, most notably on the bookending tracks. The band also mixes some straight-up blooze with its usual blooze-based sludge, via ""I Saw the Light"". Which is, of course, a track about love like nuclear war. The use of xylophone on ""Endless Yesterday"" infuses the track with a sense of psychedelic paranoia brought to bear by Arm's approximation of corny turned-on wonderment. On the flip side, when offered on ""In Search Of"", that same sort of ponderous Nuggetsy corn fails to pop. The strongest tracks mete their purported topicality with solid tunes. The denouncement of day-to-day ennui ""Empty Shells"" would sound much worse than it already does if the music-- primo Mudhoney thud and chug-- didn't sound so great. Even ""Where Is the Future"" sounds good, apart from the I Heart Heinlein bits. But then there's ""Hard-On for War"", which starts off aping ""Play That Funky Music"" and goes straight into the depths you'd expect from a song about Dad getting some gash because all the young strapping lads are off spreading democracy with their blood and guts as the spread. Granted, no one should expect Shakespeare or Dylan (even Diane Warren, really) from Mudhoney lyrics, but a song that begins with the lines, ""Can you hear the little girls asking/ Daddy where have all the little boys gone?"" has a tough task ahead of itself. And if you want to hear what happens when the album flops musically, try giving ""Oh the Move"" a listen. The one track from this disjointed and ultimately disappointing album that I, Helping Friendly Pitchfork Writer, can give an unequivocal thumbs-up is a two-minute sortie near the latter part of the album that hits it, quits it, and doesn't fuss about any worldly concerns. Of course, it's an instrumental. And, of course, it's called ""A Brief Celebration of Indifference"". If only this celebration lasted for 40 more minutes.","Veteran grunge holdovers go political on their latest Sub Pop release.

Mr. Beast,Mogwai,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38413d197565213bd4d/1:1/w_160/a0b48113.jpg,2006-03-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5371-mr-beast/,Matador,"The longest song on Mr. Beast, Mogwai's fifth studio album, runs 5:46. The entire LP clocks under 45 minutes. Ordinarily, this isn't the kind of thing you'd bother pointing out in a record review, but it bears mentioning because Mogwai are typically at their best when they let their music breathe, ebb, flow, and stretch, rather than constrict it or force it into smaller boxes. Their first and still greatest album, Young Team, showed no compunction regarding songs that extended beyond 10 minutes to make their point, and on that scale, they made the best points of their career. Last year's phenomenal BBC Sessions disc drove this home even further. Simply put, restraint does not become them. Unfortunately, restraint is a major point of order on Mr. Beast, as it has been to varying degrees on their past few studio efforts. Though the record is at no loss for power, it mostly stores it as unrealized potential: This doesn't sound like the same Mogwai that flattens audiences and then asks if the show was loud enough. Opener ""Auto Rock"" begins with a quiet piano that gains intensity as other instruments join in, phaser and distorted guitar rising like dust as the volume grows. The drumbeat verges on childlike-- a simple whack on every beat and no embellishment of any kind. But after building for just over four minutes, and then coming to an unremarkable close, it fails to leave much of an impression. The album recovers somewhat with ""Glasgow Mega-Snake"", which economically distills the essence of the band's crushing live show into three-and-a-half minutes of gut-punching nastiness. Its buildup pays off with a wrenching tempo shift and vicious guitar riff that leaves behind a weightless groove, proving it's possible for Mogwai to sustain their intensity in bite-size packages. Penultimate song ""I Chose Horses"" gets a lot of mileage out of the juxtaposition of an evenly spoken Japanese dialogue (courtesy Tetsuya Fukagawa of Japanese hardcore band Envy) against a fluctuating, mournful backdrop whose guitars are nearly indistinguishable from its synths; the primary asset of closer ""We're No Here"" is its sheer deafening loudness. The other vocal tracks switch things up nicely: ""Acid Food"" offers one of the album's most unexpectedly beautiful moments when a pedal steel enters after the second chorus, which is sung through a vocoder. But that song's aesthetic partner, ""Travel Is Dangerous"", is considerably more unruly, with two-part harmonies being doused by a wall of screaming guitar in the chorus. In combination, the two songs serve to remind that post-rock can come across as more sketched than fleshed when not properly unleashed. Mr. Beast's shortcomings lie not with what's present, but with what's missing. Mogwai are capable of tremendous beauty, poignant gloom, and ear-splitting sonic pyrotechnics, but only transcend when they combine each of these elements. Here, they rarely give themselves enough building room to conjoin these moods and styles. Resultantly, despite its peaks, the album is no match for Mogwai's best work.","Scottish post-rock band embraces restraint and shorter song lengths on its economical yet still sometimes powerful new album.

The Essential,Pansy Division,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b39d034d5c69bf2a04/1:1/w_160/e77d1161.jpg,2006-03-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6149-the-essential/,Alternative Tentacles,"In the early 1990s, four gay-and- proud fellas infiltrating the notoriously macho punk rock scene was an even greater risk than it is today. But what better way to shake things up than with bold, hilarious lyrics about gay sex and homosexual relationships? San Francisco's Pansy Division became a quintessential ""queercore"" band, and by sharing the stage with Green Day, the Supersuckers, Mr. T Experience, and the Vandals, they exposed tons of people to a new musical subculture. The Essential presents 31 tracks plucked from the band's six out-of-print Lookout Records LPs, various EPs, compilations, and their recent Alternative Tentacles release. Pansy Division's earliest material sounds similar to many of their Lookout counterparts-- short, upbeat pop- punk songs with catchy choruses, jangly guitars, pop-friendly backing vocals. In short, fun, three-chord punk at its best, all wrapped in song titles like ""Boyfriend Wanted"" or ""The Cocksucker Club"", both from the band's debut, Undressed. The band's sound slightly evolved over the course of its first few albums. ""Deep Water"", from 1994's Deflowered, is an adolescent tale of raging hormonal confusion that blends quick acoustic guitar strumming with fuzzy punk rock. The band perfected the style on that album's ""Groovy Underwear"", a hilarious ode to whitey-tighties. Light-hearted love-and-lust tunes and upbeat tales of homoeroticism make up most of the tracks from Pileup (1995), Wish I'd Taken Pictures (1996), and More Lovin' From Our Oven (1997). Tracks such as ""Horny in the Morning"", ""Dick of Death"", and ""Luv Luv Luv"" are fine examples of how fun pop-punk can be, and ""Headbanger"" is a cheeky goof on heavy metal, complete with a guitar solo by ""Al Shatonia"", aka Metallica's Kirk Hammet. By 1998's Absurd Pop Song Romance, the band's sound revealed a great deal of growth. The songs are slower, a little more complex, and the lyrical content begins to change a bit. ""You're Gonna Need Your Friends"", for example, is a sad tune about how friends help you through a breakup. On 2003's *Total Entertainment! * they dropped even more of their earlier humor and began to tackle heavier social issues. ""No Protection"" is a dance tune about the increasing HIV rate among gay men, and this boy-meets-boy story differs from so many of their earlier songs when our narrator turns down sex when his potential partner refuses to wear a condom. While the social climate in the U.S. has changed considerably since Pansy Division first started-- despite the crass use of anti-homosexual ballot measures as a tool to mobilize right-wing voters, support for gay rights has increased in the past two decades-- there are still a lot of important things for queercore bands to say, and plenty of people, both straight and gay, for them to shock.","Queercore band gets the compilation treatment with this collection of the best from its 15-plus year career.

As Templar Nites,Souls She Said,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d1ea9e61561daa5454/1:1/w_160/0c50e427.jpg,2006-03-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7847-as-templar-nites/,Dim Mak,"Hard to separate internet whisperings from real world fact, but the juicy Dim Mak Records rumor a few years back was that Devon Aoki, Dim Mak label founder Steve Aoki's sister, was not just a fashion model but either a current or former Jay-Z paramour. Who knows the un-internet-varnished truth, but Dim Mak's web page currently opens to pictures of Devon modeling with Dim Mak merchandise, and the big news on site seems to be that the label will premiere an actual fashion line or two come May. Punk stylization comes as nothing new-- Souls She Said guitarist Don Devore played in Ink & Dagger, a band that invented a genre they called ""vampire rock,"" equal parts corpse paint, antagonism, and stylized hardcore that was more gesture than orientation-- but the Dim Mak dudes, on anyone's message board, are really elevating their fashion game. Souls She Said are made up of Don Devore and Joe Cardamone, both of whom also play in the L.A.-based Icarus Line; on the Dim Mak website, the newest Icarus Line video is posted, and it largely consists of naked girls and guys rubbing pierced, normally concealed body parts against one another. Again, without guessing who's naked or why, this is all a lot of rock that doesn't look like your punk-rock older brother's flannels or button-downs. With trepidation then, I looked for clues, but extra-musically, there were few. Souls She Said have yet to show their aesthetic hand: The record artwork plays anagram games with the band name; there's some ambiguous pink and orange sketching; middle fingers sit underneath the CD tray. Song titles give away their priorities only slightly more: ""Tastefaker"", ""Floor on the Floor"", or ""Cause, I Can't Find a Place in Hell"" grate a little, but it's not like they have a song called ""AIDS Wolf"" or anything. Crack the record and learn a little more. ""Floor on the Floor"" is standard indie fake-sex warm-up stuff, spitting nonsense dance commands and 2001 Brooklyn hip-shaking bile to the tune of ""I smoke a lot/ That shit is hot,"" and worse, ""Everybody on the floor/ Everybody get on the floor."" This is a stylization we know, and even in my Brooklyn 11222, sassed falsetto, guitar swagger, and funky breaks on the snare seem all form and nothing formative. ""Tastefaker"" has something to do with a Rapture or two, punctuating 2s and 4s with little hip-thrusted guitar flourishes; although Souls She Said also slow it down to points where the song might in fact be difficult to dance to, an iPod DJ is even now fitting ""Tastefaker"" onto his Thursday night playlist. ""Sunken City"" and ""Riverbloat"" present an older look, telling sonic tales of New Order over four note descending nostalgia drops, some funky MIDI, and little modernizing bass flourishes or jarring guitars that nod to labelmates Bloc Party. Cardamone's vocal wail here is halfway between Bono and Bernard Sumner, with a little Stephen Malkmus thrown in (in particular, on ""Distralia"", a vocal dead ringer), an effect aided by Devore's occasional Pavement non-licks riffs and the fuzz they every once in a while douse the vocals with. Whether it all adds up to pseudo-side project pastiche, shiny runway fashion skronk, rock-to-get-chicks, or a heartfelt though derivative swing for the post-post-punk fence, only future releases or clothes collections will tell. One thing I do know: Unless they find some folks with ears more virgin than mine, nobody's going home with them yet. Maybe with a newer look...","Icarus Line members do post-punk pastiche on this Dim Mak release.

Rubber Traits EP,WHY?,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa2e13d19756521399bb/1:1/w_160/f9bb0d9d.gif,2006-03-02 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8673-rubber-traits-ep/,Anticon,"Since forming Why? as a solo project in 2000, San Francisco-based Yoni Wolf has expanded the lineup to include a full band. Now joined by multi-instrumentalist Doug McDiarmid, guitarist Matt Meldon, and Wolf's drummer brother Josiah, the group continue to explore the fuller, broader compositions first heard on last year's Sanddollars EP. The title track, ""Rubber Traits"", is lifted from Why?'s third album, Elephant Eyelash. It's a salient example of how the group have developed over the past year or so: heavily Pavement-influenced melodies and late 60s vocal riffs integrate with Wolf's faux-naïve humor and that definitive ""feelin' good"" West Coast sound. Many of his lyrics reference the Bay Area in favorable and colorfully descriptive ways, and it's unsurprising that, as an Ohio native, Wolf seems to relish in the city that provided a platform for his musical endeavors and community. ""Rubber Traits"" builds around a selection of Wolf's surreal observations, ranging from the romantically odd (""I want to kiss like taffy, and hump gentle on a bed of nails"") to the macabre: (""and watch a fly hit a pane of glass until he gets real bony and his stomach swells up and he dies""). As a whole, the lyrics flow through the music like curiously nonsensical daydreams, but their slightly sinister edge infects the mass of major chords and prevents them from sounding too sugary. On the EP's three previously unreleased tracks, Why? flourish as a band. The guitars are delicately jangly, and McDiarmid's piano chords embellish songs like ""Pick Fights"" to strikingly simple effect, intersecting Wolf as he reflects on his Ohio days. (""The best place to pick a fight is in the Midwest...""). Although Why? has always been one of the more accessible, pop-oriented artists on anticon, Wolf really shines when he drops the happy-go-lucky tonal gloss in exchange for darker lyrics and beats. ""Deceived"", the final track on Rubber Traits, delivers a low tone monologue cut over steady, atmospheric rhythms that recalls the introspective, fluid rapping of fellow anticon associate Buck 65. Including this sharp-witted excerpt on Rubber Traits show how multi-faceted Wolf's music can be, while drawing tighter comparisons to his involvement with side projects cLOUDDEAD and Hymie's Basement. Appended to the audio disc is filmmaker Ravi Zupa's wonderfully creepy video for ""Rubber Traits"". Going along with the Californian, off-key psychedelic vibe perpetuated by Why?, Zupa uses headache-inducing colors and flurries of flower icons to decorate his bizarre, and often very funny, pastiches. These are mostly set around his collages of dog photographs in which the canine snouts are replaced by the moving mouths of the band members. The mustached spaniel-- which looks worryingly like Frank Zappa-- is very effective during the Beach Boys ""oooh wee oooh"" chorus, though the icing on the cake has to be when Wolf juggles grapefruits in a bath shared by a rather shocked and toothy pug.","The title track and Elephant Eyelash single is accompanied by three previously unreleased tracks on this anticon release.

bluefolk,Stone Jack Jones,by: Stephen M.

This biographical nugget sounds like press-release fodder, but it becomes more significant when you hear the first couple of songs on his second album, bluefolk: Opener ""Smile"" and the menacing ""Bread"" are pitch-dark and subterranean, with rough melodies pickaxed from rock and cacophonous instruments that coalesce into mine-rail beats. ""Danger lurks like a breaking limb,"" he warns on ""Vivid""; death isn't just ever present, but a driving force. Lyrically, Jones finds inspiration in Biblical foreboding, keeping one foot in Genesis and the other in the Book of Revelation, caught between original sin and the end of the world. ""Can you hear the horses galloping on?"" he asks repeatedly on ""Hey Love"". On ""Bread""-- ostensibly an antiwar song based on Jones' own thwarted draft during the Vietnam War-- he carries on a conversation with a frantic Abraham, who's searching for his lost son, ""the almost-murdered one."" Instead of sounding obvious or outrageous, the exchange sounds perfectly apt within Jones' apocalyptic mountain music. But it's the music on bluefolk and Jones' vocal performance that gives these songs their simultaneously claustrophobic and mesmeric power. The rumble of instruments that begins ""Smile"" sets the tone, and the martial programmed beat on ""Bread"" pushes the other instruments militaristically as Patty Griffin's backing vocals offset Jones' gruffer voice. On ""Vivid"" he runs his words together until they lose their mean and become pure sound: ""vividis vividisvividdoes."" The motion of those syllables becomes curiously unsettling. On an album like bluefolk, where everything sounds submerged in shadows, light is only a relative term, but the songs' progress is a kind of resurfacing, with Jones climbing out of his dark pit and back onto the surface of the earth. The songs grow less and less opaque as he makes naked declarations of conflicted love, as on ""Evermore"": ""I miss you I want you I lay you beside you I reach for you dubiously."" The wall of sound that confined earlier songs crumbles as the lyrics and instruments separate, the tempos slacken, and the melodies soften, culminating with the spare and strangely moving ""Freedom"", constructed around a clip from a Martin Luther King Jr. speech. In other hands, this type of finale might have been fatally transparent, drawing a too-straight line from 60s revolution to 90s complacency. But Jones wisely keeps his intentions mysterious and personal, which prevents the album's second half from being a letdown after the more intense first half. Continuing in the vein of those early songs would have produced a smothering album, so Jones lets a little light in, if only to show how dark the world can be.","Hailing from a West Virginia coal-mining family, this singer/songwriter finds lyrical inspiration in Biblical foreboding.

Big Apple Rappin',Various Artists,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ecb1335d7bf169916c/1:1/w_160/1e82c2ad.jpg,2006-03-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1998-big-apple-rappin/,Soul Jazz,"In his 2005 book of photography, A Time Before Crack, Jamel Shabazz collected images from New York City during the embryonic days of hip-hop, pre-heated-coke-explosion. It's a page-turner of borough teens in tight jeans, shells, Clydes, and Cazals, rocking boomboxes and beltbuckle nameplates. Not much has changed then, other than pervasive crack-rhetoric in raps and, of course, all the crack, which itself cuts trends, shunts history, and supplies the nostalgic weight to back-in-the-day comps like Big Apple Rappin', a stack of some of hip-hop's earliest pressings. But the songs here are more than rose-tinted artifacts. While they do convey the blitheness before ""The Message"", they also dispel myths about hip-hop's natal innocence, naivet, and homogeneity. Most importantly though, for songs built specifically not-to-last, some still sound pretty fresh. Not all timeless, some are what they are, seven-minute one-take prattling over interpolated disco r&b; (sounds cooler than it is) recorded to fill one side of a 12"". Most tedious of these are the title track by Spyder D, clocking in at 10-plus minutes of repping every block and crew in NYC (Ashford & Simpson?), and Nice and Nasty 3's ""The Ultimate Rap"", which at nine minutes tests the patience for Cheryl Lynn. Not to take anything away from their place in history, but they are museum pieces. Less dusty is Masterdon & The Def Committee's ""Funkbox Party"", which features a classic 808 under the fast-raps of Gangster Gee and the original hard-spitting female, Pebblee Poo, who'd already spent time in Kool Herc's Herculoids. But the selections aging best are the ones that were idiosyncratic from the jump. Spoonie Gee's ""Spoonin' Rap"" is a nine-minute echoplexed rant that starts with copping feelings on girls to catching feelings from dudes in prison. There's a lesson there. The ladies are more than objects here, though, as Xanadu supply Debbie Harry with a style, and Universal 2 are proto-Salt-N-Pepa. Conscious-rap is covered by Brother D & the Collective Effort, and the Fly Guys' high-on-life whisper song, which relies on a knocking milk bottle. Connecting the dots between the Bronx and Kingston are General Echo's ""Rapping Dub Style"", lazing horns and diddly-dees included, and the Jamaica Girls' ""Rock The Beat"", non-rapped but like-minded. So on a compilation of hip-hop's dawn, you've got live bands, drum machines, politics, nonsense, misogyny, homophobia, and partying, all set to dance music, some of it stolen wholesale from its origins. Just saying. Regardless, Soul Jazz once again give us clear versions of rare gems and essentials, packaged with loads of interviews, photos and old show flyers, courtesy the relentless research of Johan ""Google Me"" Kugleberg. Not just for old folks, Big Apple Rappin' still manages to party fairly hard, although it probably shouldn't have tried to get into those Jordaches.","Soul Jazz comp captures the sounds of New York hip-hop circa 1979-82.

Youth,Matisyahu,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36413d197565213bd0d/1:1/w_160/3a7177c4.jpg,2006-03-02 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5661-youth/,EpicJDubOr,"Matisyahu (née Matthew Miller) is a guy from White Plains, N.Y. who smoked weed and followed Phish and played in those drum circles everyone hates. One spiritual breakthrough later, he realized he loved dancehall reggae and Judaism (order unclear) and started making music. He performs wearing traditional Hasidic garb, and he beatboxes and stagedives. That's the whole story. Stop reading those magazine articles. His music, however, isn't all that special. Mixing high school retreat Rasta spitting, Yiddish verse, and occasionally legit patois over a synthesized version of trad reggae, he's on that old search for enlightenment and devotion but his struggle reeks of bored rich kid. Foolish to question his faith, but in the face of Bob Marley's homeland righteousness and complicated politics or Sizzla's maniacal, militant Rastafarianism, Matisyahu's roots reggae is flimsy stuff. Not necessary novelty. Just not that novel. Matisyahu's third album is his first studio release since last year's rep-making SXSW performance and comes on the heels of a live album, Live at Stubb's, that currently resides in the Billboard top 50. The LP is overrun with standard religious tropes. Youth was produced by Material linchpin Bill Laswell, who issued Trojan's Dub Massive Chapters One & Two last year and has helped produce avant-garde music for the likes of John Zorn, Laurie Anderson, and Herbie Hancock (he played bass on ""Rockit""). His contributions are obvious on ""Indestructible"" and ""Late Night in Zion"", tracks that glide away from traditional Jamrock stomp and dabble in bouncy ethereal movements and wanky soloing. Lyrically, Godspeak is unassailable stuff (ask Sufjan) but Matisyahu is not immune to clunky turns of phrase like, ""What I'm fighting for is more than silver and gold"" or ""I'm all shook up like I been in the blender,"" and is often downed by them. ""Unique in My Dove"" is admirable stuff, pleading and pledging fidelity to his woman, and extrapolated to his faith. But it's treacle jammy stuff; with all those natty drum fills, MOR progressions, and lockstep dub grooves the good will goes to shit. Authenticity and showmanship appear to be the stumbling blocks and great emancipators for Matisyahu. Inexplicably, he attracts jam-rock blaggards and disoriented hipsters with nowhere else to turn with his wacky ability to make beat noises out of his mouth. It was annoying when Justin Timberlake did it and it's annoying now. Still, as large venues continue to sell out, Baby Boomers remember they luuuhve Marley and hey, this guy, at least, kinda sounds like him if you can't remember the 70s that well. Plus he's worth an extra 20 minutes of convos at the steak house before the show. ""Wait, he's Jewish? You're kidding!?!"" It's sad that relatively innocuous musicians are indicted on the strength of their audience, but sometimes the demographics don't lie. In his 2005 end-of-the-year comments, Pitchfork's boss hog Ryan Schreiber dissed Matis simply by quoting the Bravery's Sam Enidcott's ill-considered declaration that ""This is the future of music."" Others have also hopped on this dubious idea. I'm not entirely sure anyone knows what Endicott's statement means. I suspect the next Hasidic dude rocking the mic is gonna get shouted down for being a poseur. Perhaps Endicott meant that artists who step out of their cultural realm and embrace an unlikely sound to deliver their message are the future. There might be something to that.","Hasidic reggae star and frathouse favorite follows last year's star-making SXSW performance and a successful live album with his highly anticipated major-label debut.

The Steady Hand,New Radiant Storm King,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e85e6ef95969323930/1:1/w_160/52e7e16a.gif,2006-03-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5776-the-steady-hand/,Darla,"An unhappy late-1990s memory of mine consists of Giovanni Ribisi's pants down, full junk out in the non-remake remake, SubUrbia: no Vandals or TSOL, just swinging balls to period-piece Decline-of-Western-Indie-Rock mood-setting. That movie and soundtrack were stillbirths-- angst-doses for kids who'd already been getting them on screen and stereo for six or seven years-- and even my young self sensed something slacker was dying. New Radiant Storm King's The Steady Hand arrives then as a super-oddity: call it spirit of spiritless '97, or SubUrbia soundtrack redux. Their ""Accountant of the Year"" is Girls Against Boys' ""Bulletproof Cupid""; ""Fighting off the Pricks"" is Superchunk's ""Does Your Hometown Care?""; ""Yardsale Legacy"" gets to be Sonic Youth's ""Sunday"" of course; even ""From a Roof"" could be the Butthole Surfers' ""Human Cannonball"". That that kind of major-labelled indie rock was already choking itself to death circa then-- same for the last vestiges of anything called ""college rock."" Regardless, New Radiant Storm King's website still reads as elegy for Nirvana magic-markered flyers and Homestead Records. We learn about gigs with Sebadoh and GBV, sleeping over at the Unwound house, and they even offer up a depressing late vestige of the Year-Punk-Broke contract boom: either a very large or very small $45,000 from Grass records, a former Dutch East India subsidiary. It gets worse. Try a '97 tour with ""it's good to be the king""-era Creed, then shelved contracts, unreturned phone calls, and inevitable indie oblivion. I did college radio in Massachusetts, which meant I was knee-deep in NRSK detritus. They had splits with Silver Jews, Polvo, GBV; everyone who followed '90s rock ended up with at least a compilation song; like most people I played the flip of those records, or other songs off the comps, but they were old familiars. Who knew they still breathed? But also, why? Their buzz is now commonly spun as ""near miss,"" but that's just B-list fate. My friend Joshua had a high school (circa 1993) fling with Rival Time's ""Phonecall"", a college love-letter/acid-in-the-woods slacker paean to a girl with ""brand new glasses."" Stack that against The Steady Hand's 2006 pseudo-social commentary ""Accountant of the Year"": ""I think I'll go in early today/ I think I'll catch an earlier train/ I'm going to make my quota today."" I'll take the girl, thanks guys, and not just because my grandfather was an accountant. Ditto on the minefield truisms of ""Fighting off the Pricks"": emo-by-numbers ""every atom of my being beckons me to keep on staying here,"" complete with falsetto chorus, and sweeping dual guitars (one vaguely jangling lead, the other the epic rhythm). College crushes are cute but at least a couple of these dudes ought to married by now, no? We should root for the underdog though, and unreconstructed '93 indie is definitely that. Their rallying cry, for a guy looking pretty hard for one, wasn't too hard to find on The Steady Hand.

Babies Makin' Babies 2: Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies,Questlove,by: Will Dukes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d1c0084474cd0bfed7/1:1/w_160/4a5d9232.gif,2006-03-01 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6630-babies-makin-babies-2-misery-strikes-backno-more-babies/,BBE,"Who, if not famed cratedigger ?uestlove, can compile a good mix? The hirsute Roots drummer is a world-class DJ, known for seamless sets, and a well-known musical connoisseur with an overwhelming collection of records. Babies Makin' Babies 2: Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies, like its predecessor, confirms ?uest's credentials. But let's be clear: The first one is a good if somewhat basic get-the-drawz mix; this more complex installment, which effortlessly moves from seeming sad to sounding sweet, is even better. A nod to the lovelorn, Babies has its share of blue tunes, like ""Our Love Has Died"", which wallows in self-pity, as Ohio Players' Leroy ""Sugarfoot"" Bonner grieves a failed affair: ""They buried our love, six feet down/ No mourners, no mourners came around."" His cheerless drawl, set to dirge-like drums, then morphs to full-blown sulk-fest. ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"", which sports a lush guitar, is willfully glum. Al Green is asking that which-- judging by his grief-- is unanswerable; the song's title may as well be ""How Can You Squeeze Blood From a Stone"". Thankfully, ?uest also includes songs that tell the female side of the story. Syreeta's ""Cause We've Ended Now as Lovers"" is brooding but big-hearted. The Stevie Wonder protégé ponders lost innocence over acoustic soul strumming: ""Lovers walking in the rain/ So close, we feel each other's pain/ But now, you say that love has died away."" None of the standard reproof (which inflames her male contemporaries) is heard in her quiet contralto. On the other hand, Betty Davis' ""Anti Love Song"" seethes with righteous wrath, proving it takes two to tango. While Babies feels complete, it still misses some essentials-- Marvin Gaye's ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"" would have worked well here; ""Jessica"", by Herbie Hancock, also comes to mind. Then again, those songs are likely too bleak for Babies, whose most melancholic tracks (""Our Love Has Died"", ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"") are not as dismal; both songs are sweetened by immaculate production. Likewise, Natalie Cole's ""Good Morning Heartache"" has a technicolor, variety-show grandness that invalidates its woe. At any rate, ?uest achieves a rare combination: a sonic pity party with a soul-soothing sheen.","Roots drummer and champion cratedigger follows his BMB mixtape with a sequel that focuses on breakup songs and is appropriately subtitled Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies.

Please Come Back EP,Catfish Haven,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7509d034d5c69bf3770/1:1/w_160/590bcd7b.jpg,2006-03-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1828-please-come-back-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Two gigantic red flags flap at the gates of Catfish Haven's Please Come Back EP. The first is the band's name. I'm wary whenever I see such a pointedly bucolic name attached to an indie label, as young sophisticates appropriating earnest backwater idioms tend to be boring at best and terrible at worst. My suspicion that Catfish Haven was a condescending indie-country band or ironic roots rock revival seemed to be borne out by red flag number two, frontman George Hunter's hoarse album-opening declaration: ""We're Catfish Haven and this is what we do!"" What, recycle old tropes of workmanlike humility without the hard-earned lived experience to justify them? Turns out I was wrong on both counts, and by the end of the title track, those red warning flags had both been bleached surrender-white. Catfish Haven scan as a bar band-- what with Hunter's smoky-throated moans and the lucid, feel-good quality of the music-- but there is no irony here. Nothing in the hooky melodies is purposefully obscured, and there's no sense of winking amusement at playing rootsy bar rock in a post-rock musical climate. It's the EP's open quality-- the songs are simple and everything happens right before your eyes-- that retroactively recasts Hunter's introductory invocation of sincere bar bands past as a self-effacing extension of his unflashy yet satisfying music. On the title track's searing rave-up, staccato emotive bursts get swept up in a tide of concisely pounding percussion and stately rhythm guitar. Projecting from the diaphragm without overselling the memorable melody, Hunter's voice can crank up like a lawnmower or suddenly dip into bluesy melancholy with equal facility, and on this track in particular he belts like Van Morrison at his amped-up best. But this isn't his only register. On the smoldering dirge ""Crying Shame"", Hunter trades his exuberance for a sinister theatricality á la Nick Cave, dragging the last word of each line over infernal embers. Both styles find purchase on ""Madelin"", as whining string bends and a diabolically distressed ""whoa"" suddenly let out into winsome, clattering rock. Take away quirky instrumentation, genre experiments, and yelping vocals; what's left in the modern guitar band's arsenal? Catfish Haven remind us: Tuneful, passionate singing, lucid songwriting, and engaging riffs.","Secretly Canadian debut from this Chicago-based indie band is full of tuneful, passionate singing and lucid songwriting.

"Weapons of Ass Destruction / Live in Japan, V.1",Diskaholics Anonymous Trio,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd05e6ef95969322cd8/1:1/w_160/8ddbccc5.jpg,2006-03-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11726-weapons-of-ass-destruction-live-in-japan-v1/,Smalltown SuperjazzSmalltown Superjazz,"Comprised of Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, and Mats Gustafsson, the Diskaholics Anonymous Trio represents the sort of free noise/improv summit meeting that I've unfortunately grown conditioned to approach with skepticism. All too often such alliances come to resemble hastily formed blue-ribbon committees rather than actual bands, with each member loudly pushing his own incompatible agenda or, conversely, so deferential to one another that little of genuine worth ever gets accomplished. And the fact that the Diskaholics each have such a prolific, indiscriminate history of on-the-fly collaborations and makeshift side projects does little to ease my trepidation. Thankfully, however, these three skilled musicians are no strangers to each other, and their careers have fruitfully intersected on numerous occasions over the years. Saxophonist Gustafsson has worked with O'Rourke at least as far back as Gastr del Sol's 1996 album Upgrade and Afterlife. More recently, of course, O'Rourke has shared time with Moore in Sonic Youth, and they were joined by Gustafsson on 2004's experimental Hidros 3 (To Patti Smith). This familiarity proved a substantial boon on the Diskaholics' self-titled debut album, released in 2001 on the Japanese label Crazy Wisdom. Featuring O'Rourke on electronics, Moore on guitar, and Gustafsson on a variety of doctored reeds, the album was a measured, surprisingly graceful work of controlled electricity that brought the three musicians' voices into effortless balance. The trio's chief strength lies in its malleability, as both Gustafsson and O'Rourke are rightfully celebrated as much for their cross-textual versatility than for any specific individual sound, while Moore provides the appropriate degree of amp-humping enthusiasm. Effective though the project was, the album appeared to be simply another one-off, seemingly organized around the threesome's joint record-shopping sprees rather than any future collaborative plans. But that impression changes with the appearance of two ferocious new Diskaholics albums, both of which indicate the trio ought to be considered an active, ongoing concern. Inveterate vinyl hounds that they are, the Diskaholics have clearly organized both of these albums as ""sides,"" with each split into two expansive, equal-length improvisations. Without so much as a drumbeat to light their way, both albums are markedly harsher and more fragmented than the trio's debut, and venture ever further from avant-rock or free jazz orthodoxy. First up is Weapons of Ass Destruction-- a title so ridiculous the only marvel is that Toby Keith didn't think of it first. Although neither of the album's two halves contains anything as thoughtfully refined as the epic ""Totally Gump (Gump Completist)"" from their debut, both pieces feature impressive blasts of scaly, creepshow theatrics and scorched earth drones. ""Part 1"" opens onto an alien mountainscape studded with O'Rourke's mysterious synth swells, but before long Gustafsson comes to the fore, tearing away into the upper registers with a spirited fury reminiscent of free-blowing pioneers like Arthur Jones or Frank Wright. The motion gets more compressed on ""Part 2"", as all three players elongate their sound into dense, high-action drones. At some moment of spontaneous union, everything coalesces to the extent that it's difficult to determine who exactly is playing what, with Gustafsson's attenuated tones fusing exquisitely and inseparably with Moore's sculpted feedback and O'Rourke's analog thrum. Recorded in 2002 while on a tour/record hunt in Japan, Live in Japan, Vol. 1 is a considerably scrappier affair. On the first track, ""Bent Triangle Pinakotheca"", there is an increased emphasis on O'Rourke's granular digital textures, including several piercing, Whitehouse-inspired tones that border closely on the painful. O'Rourke also is credited with mixing the album, and it's left unclear what enhancements he might have added during post-production. Nevertheless, the album's second piece ""Unreleased Voice"" culminates in an unbelievably concentrated implosion of noise, as the Diskaholics each grind their instruments to their savage limits. Although this prolonged outburst will surely resemble a trough of caviar for true avant-noise gourmets, it's almost guaranteed to clear the premises of anybody expecting to hear pale echoes of Insignificance or Goo. As the ""Vol. 1"" of this album's title clearly suggests, it appears there could be more such Diskaholics material to come. And based on the evidence of these two brutal, provocative albums, that news shouldn't necessarily come as anything to dread.",,7.2,
LateNightTales,Belle and Sebastian,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0be13d197565213846c/1:1/w_160/f47f5361.gif,2006-03-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/640-latenighttales/,Azuli,"Once a furtive marker of recognition among like-minded obsessives, Belle and Sebastian have increasingly attracted casual listeners. Recent full-length The Life Pursuit completed the break with the band's outsiders-as-insiders origins, becoming their first album to reach the UK top 10. With the latest installment in the LateNightTales compilation series, previously curated by the Flaming Lips and Four Tet, the Scottish group poses an inevitable cred-salvaging question: But have you seen their records? Oh, sure, they've got it all: funk, jazz, soul, hip-hop, lounge, tropicalia, IDM, Afropop, classical, classic rock, reggae, country reggae, reggae funk (but not reggaeton), and a hazy spoken-word piece by comedian David Shrigley in which an old woman dishes about her husband's ""apparatus."" It's never clear which specific band member chooses each track. No matter: Stuart Murdoch & Co. throw down the pop archivist's gauntlet impressively, though it often feels they're trying too hard to impress. Like the recent Rough Trade Counter Culture comp, the disc is too varied for many one-sitting listens, but as a crate-digging exercise it yields a few directions for further exploration. The plaintive vocals of Greek troubadour Demis Roussos on his sparse 1972 ballad ""O My Friends You've Been Untrue To Me"" should appeal to Antony and the Johnsons fans. California soul singer Mary Love's uptempo mid-1960s also-ran ""I'm in Your Hands"" has the energetic appeal of the best Motown. Gal Costa's Caetano Velosi-penned 1969 ""Lost in the Paradise"" is swooning, horn-drenched bossa nova, while Ramsey Lewis's funky jazz entry from the same year, ""Uhuru"", features Earth, Wind & Fire founder Maurice White on kalimba. Erick and Mondrek Muchena add a taste of Zimbabwe amid the dusty rhythms of ""Taireva"". To be fair, Tom Middleton already picked the Peddlers' sub-Sinatra crooner ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever"" for another compilation series, Family's The Trip, but this song remains the only good argument for a new Austin Powers sequel. Other tracks fall deeper into novelty territory. Elsie Mae and the barrel-voiced Walter Jackson each turn in powerful performances, but their material-- a tepid ""Rescue Me"" knock-off and an overwrought soul weeper, respectively-- explains their lack of wider fame. It's hard to say what Belle & Sebastian were thinking when they mashed up Johnny Cash's mariachi-laced ""Ring of Fire"" with the West Kingston skank of the Ethiopians' ""Freeman"", but Butch Cassidy Sound System's ""Cissy Strut"" works with the classic Meters tune. Where the compilation intermittently succeeds is in building a foggy, buzzed late-night atmosphere, true to its title. Rehash's opening ""Gratuitous Theft in the Rain"" sets the scene with David Axelrod-like loops, bringing to mind Rjd2, whose heartbreaking Deadringer hidden track and single ""Here's What's Left"" also appears. Madlib's Lootpack offers the slinky ""Questions"". A dancefloor rendering of the Stylistics' ""People Make The World Go Round"" by Paperclip People, aka Carl Craig, achieves a futuristic Herbertian sheen that almost transcends its smooth-jazz sax. Contrast that with Novi Singers' Polish-language vocal jazz. The electronic textures of Múm's ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" and Space Jam's 1998 12-inch ""Let Your Conscience Be Your Guidance"" prove even more immersive. No worries, a few tracks also conjure the band's own sound. On ""Get Thy Bearings"", from 1968's Hurdy Gurdy Man, unlikely indie-yuppie precursor Donovan floats his fey, Murdoch-like vocals atop jazzy instrumentals fit for Astral Weeks, which was released the same year. Big Star's ""Watch the Sunrise"", from 1972's #1 Record shares the gawky acoustic glow of ""Mayfly"" or ""I Don't Love Anyone"". Stereolab melds ""Eleanor Rigby"" strings and joyously fuzzy guitars on 1993 touchstone ""French Disko"". Steve Miller Band's ""Fly Like an Eagle"" sounds kinda like how haters described The Life Pursuit, except this time it really is flatulent mid-70s astro-blooz, which no amount of so-unhip-it's-hip trend-speculating (BTW sooo unhip) can salvage. So it goes: Eclecticism and obscurantism provide the tale of the tape in record-collector apparatus-measuring contests. By this standard, Belle & Sebastian's LateNightTales is a prodigious success. The band's lone recording here, a breezy, overlookable cover of ""Casaco Marron"" by Evinha-- a member of Brazilian a cappella group Trio Esperanca-- seals the victory, pyrrhic as Plutarch. Belle and Sebastian's fan culture may have always encouraged vinyl fetishism, but the misplaced machismo in this nugget-flaunting display seems gauche given the delicate wit of the band's original compositions. Dudes, you're not losing your edge.","Scottish band curate the latest edition of this venerable comp series, offering a diverse range of selections that includes funk, jazz, soul, hip-hop, lounge, tropicalia, IDM, Afropop, classical, classic rock, and reggae, as well as their own cover of the Brazilian song ""Casaco Marron"".

Electric President,Electric President,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1413d197565213b472/1:1/w_160/fba93f60.jpg,2006-02-28 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2938-electric-president/,Morr,"There's an appealing modesty at work on the debut album by Electric President, a Florida duo that confidently allow their homespun electro-pop to bubble away without feeling the need to constantly doctor the ingredients. Created under bedroom-like conditions by Ben Cooper and Alex Kane, these earnest songs are largely crafted through a soft and reliable mixture of acoustic strums, clip-clop beats, and gently surging electronic tides. Cooper's chirpy, boyish vocals make comparisons to Ben Gibbard that much more mandatory, but the album quietly moves to its own private compass, drawn by a certain resigned, melancholic gravity. The biggest hitch is that Electric President seemingly achieve all of their humble goals by mid-album, and so spend almost half their time with pencils down, repeating the day's assignments silently to themselves. ""We're all just part of someone's elaborate plan/ Just pieces in some grandiose scheme,"" Cooper sings on ""Grand Machine No. 12"", succinctly articulating the album's recurrent theme of a vague alienation and eventual obsolescence. This sense of helpless entropy also informs the album's most engaging track, ""Ten Thousand Lines"", where Cooper serenades the decaying wires in his bedroom wall over a gentle feedback throb reminiscent of Yo La Tengo's Electr-O-Pura. Additionally, this track is expertly punctuated by overlapping vocals, deftly edited dialogues between guitar and laptop, and several melodic ""Oh no's"" worthy of the Rutles. Even more ambitious-- but no less effective-- is the opening ""Good Morning, Hypocrite"", which is virtually the only song here that Electric President sound willing to forcefully coerce into a new direction, its perky tempo abruptly accelerating until Cooper's vocal is just barely able catch onto the rear bumper. It isn't long, however, before the album's persistent threads of indeterminate loss and decline turn inevitably to undiluted moping over failed romances. ""Hum"" is a purebred fire escape lament, with a heartsick Cooper calling out, ""What do you think about me now?"" to the disinterested rooftops. And he's still out there later on ""Some Crap About the Future"", wistfully watching airplanes leave the city, self-consciously admitting to ineffectual ""rambling"" but not able to bring himself to stop. Unfortunately, on these occasions Electric President are unable to musically assuage his sorrows, having already pushed the limits on their invention. Cuts like the miniature shoegaze of ""Snow on Dead Neighborhoods"" or the politely grungy ""We Were Never Built To Last"" veritably beg for less constraint, more sweeping grandeur, or simply heightened volume to allow a push beyond the duo's established templates. But Electric President remain steadfastly restrained throughout, right up until the willowy, climactic ""Farewell"" where they at last unleash a measured broadside of furious noise, willing for once to become the forceful architects of their music rather than merely its passive stewards.","Florida duo create homespun, earnest electro-pop and, fittingly, are signed to Morr Music.

Ackrill/Venning '91,Hank,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17313d197565213bbe4/1:1/w_160/fe0465ef.gif,2006-02-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4007-ackrillvenning-91/,Blocks,"Hank's debut album, How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years, was one of those DIY surprises we're afforded a couple of times every year: A manic, scattershot pile of tunes salvaged from an alternate universe pop landfill, released in a limited edition that gave each copy its own unique artwork. It was a chaotic mess, but it was charming in its way, not to mention insidiously catchy. The follow-up, Ackrill/Venning '91 doesn't exude the same amount of curio charm that elevated its predecessor. It has its moments of inspired lunacy, but at 10 songs in less than 19 minutes, it doesn't have time to get its hooks in you, and the misfires loom all the larger. When you have a song that lasts all of 1:36 and consists of nothing but a woman singing, ""I do not not not not not/ Like getting fucked over by my friends"" over a couple of pretty basic garage band beats, it begs for context, but as it is, ""Getting Fucked Over By Your Friends"" is just pretty annoying. And amateurish vocals can be great, but there's a definable line between unstudied and just horrendously off-key, which is what the singing on the over-distorted ""Avoid the Docks"" is. It's not all bad, of course. At their best, Hank fit in pretty comfortably between Swell Maps and the Go! Team. The prophetically titled ""Danes in Peril!"" is a great opener, with a call-and-response between what sounds like a couple of cheerleaders and an old English wino over a sturdy acoustic guitar riff and New Wave drums. ""Lakeshore Report Diluted: Sources"" has a sort of mutant Northern Soul rhythm track and comes off like a Motown song after ten generations of enthusiastic in-breeding. Two slower songs are strangely ingratiating: ""Dark Country"" is a nice creepy crawler with some amusing spoken-word bits, a good bass part and simulated steel guitar, with the great refrain ""I dedicate this to all my dead friends,"" while ""He Forgot My Name"" overcomes its weird, childlike female vocals (not quite on pitch at any point) to create an oddly haunting atmosphere. Even with these peaks, though, there's a sense when the album comes to a close with the pinched fuzz-rock of ""My Non-Fights"" that something's missing, and the album isn't really satisfying. And anyway, this is music that most people will either love for its exuberant lack of discipline or hate for the very same reason, and something makes me suspect the former camp will leave wishing for a bigger dose.","10-track, 19-minute EP from the sometimes charming DIY indie pop act.

Snow,Curt Kirkwood,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc545e6ef95969322e08/1:1/w_160/b835603a.gif,2006-02-28 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4608-snow/,Little Dog,"If the review is late, just say we were waiting for the title to become timely-- released last October, Snow is the official solo debut of Curt Kirkwood. You might know him as the guitarist for the Meat Puppets, who, despite several albums and a storied past-- their beginnings with SST, their early 90s radio hit ""Backwater"", their disintegration and then rebirth with Curt at the helm in 2000-- are still most widely known for being dragged onstage and covered by Nirvana on the grunge band's Unplugged album and MTV appearance. Aside from just being a tasteful (and indebted) listener, Kurt Cobain had a sharp ear to hear the lurching rhythms and woozy, off-kilter harmonies on Meat Puppets II and realized those songs would translate beautifully in a quieter cast. Years later, Kirkwood isn't running from it: He's the last Puppet standing, and Snow is an austere acoustic record on which his country-rock influences finally take the front seat. Still, a grown-up and cleaned-up Kirkwood remains a beautiful guitarist and an able songwriter. It's no surprise he approaches these influences with caution and tastefulness, just as he reconciled his virtuosity with the noisy punk-influenced style of his former band. Nor does he crowd the tune. A mandolin plucks busily behind the guileless melody of the title track, hinging on a pleasant, evocative turn of phrase in the chorus (""Just like snow settles on barbed wire""). Country-tinged pop like ""Beautiful Weapon"" and ""Box of Limes"" feature great relaxed harmonies from Kirkwood, while the electric guitars growl just beneath the acoustic strumming that dominates the album. The circular, almost baroque guitar figure and bucket bass on ""Gold"" nail that same high-altitude, low-oxygen feeling of the Puppets' spacier moments. The more straight-up country tracks like ""Movin' On"" or the closing ""Circles"" aren't among my favorites, though they benefit from Kirkwood's careful arranging. ""Here Comes Forever"" even welcomes the slowing of age by showing the influence of Shari Lewis in its lyrics (""This song is bound to wander on, on and on/ This song could never be too long, no stopping I'm guessing""). But this doesn't mean these songs can't take fascinating left turns with their sleeves still around their wrists. The circuitous square-dance melody of ""Light Bulb"" drops suddenly for spaced-out chords, distortion, and jazz trumpet. ""In Bone"" starts as a dirge with barely any accompaniment but Kirkwood's voice and (for once) minimal guitar, but the chorus has the album's fullest arrangement and, arguably, its finest moment.","Former Meat Puppets leader shows his country-rock influences on this austere acoustic record.

Mews Too: An Asthmatic Kitty Compilation,Various Artists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a763b1335d7bf1699043/1:1/w_160/0a6b34fe.jpg,2006-02-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1849-mews-too-an-asthmatic-kitty-compilation/,Asthmatic Kitty,"It's hilarious that a record label this perpetually mild is responsible for the bizarre phrase ""an Asthmatic Kitty Compilation."" Unintentionally evoking a field-recorded nightmare chorus of wheezing felines, the image is grotesque and completely at odds with the label's aesthetic, which, over the course of this sampler, shapes up like this: Find affable white people with acoustic guitars, establish a continuum spanning quirky indie-folk (e.g. Half-Handed Cloud) and Borders-listening-station MOR folk (e.g. Denison Witmer), sprinkle with Judeo-Christian imagery and wind chimes. Repeat as necessary. Perhaps since Asthmatic Kitty has a small roster of artists, Mews Too rounds out a smattering of new tracks from heavyweights like Sufjan Stevens and Danielson with back-catalog songs from like-minded artists only casually associated with the label. Asthmatic Kitty's not the most versatile imprint, and the 24 tracks herein divide neatly into five simple categories: Sufjan (one song); Sounds Pretty Much Just Like Sujfan or His Female Equivalent (12 songs); Danielson (one song); Sounds an Awful Lot Like Danielson (three songs); and Amazingly Doesn't Sound Much Like Sufjan or Danielson, clocking in at a respectable seven songs. So if you're into eclecticism or allergic to acoustic guitars and polite vocals, give this one a wide berth. But if you enjoy the comfort of well-worn idioms, there's plenty for you here. Sufjan checks in with his typical elegant reserve. Bogs Visionary Orchestra breaks the folky monotony with an old-timey country shuffle; Half-Handed Cloud does the same with loopy harmonies and giddy trombones; Bunky with stomping sax lines. Castanets offer a brief reworking of the ominous title track from First Light's Freeze. Danielson, Men of Old, and Matthew Haseltine get all twitchy and shambling. Barring these diversions, the overall tone is one of innocuous beauty, although there are a few jarring missteps. My Brightest Diamond, Sam Rosen, and Liz Janes misplace their melodies in overstated vocal flourishes, while Jai Agnish soft-focuses his into anonymity. And now the question burning in everyone's mind can no longer be held at bay: How Christian is it? Short answer: Besides one overt messianic sally from Royal City, hardly at all. I've publicly derided the persecution narrative surrounding the music with Christian themes marketed to secular audiences. Think being a Christian in 21st century America bestows outsider status? Try singing about Allah for perspective. But the erroneous assumptions with which I approached this compilation lead me to believe that maybe there's something to it. It's perfectly understandable that bands who dabble in Christianity with a measure of sophistication would want to distance themselves from ""Christian rock,"" one of the most crassly manufactured of genres. Trivial references to Christianity get blown out of proportion in the music press (he says coyly)-- a song that happens to mention a Buick Skylark isn't perceived as being ""about cars,"" but a song that mentions Jesus, even once, becomes ""about Jesus."" In the end, though, it's probably of little consequence, since the trendy kids that supposedly discriminate against the new folk's occasional Christian themes aren't a logical audience for it based on sonics alone-- it's for emo kids, adult-contemp mavens, other warm fuzzies. You can not sing about Jesus all day, but if you're wearing a cardigan and plucking a banjo, the kid in the DFA t-shirt is probably going to clown you anyway.","Label collection features new tracks from Sufjan Stevens, Danielson, Half-Handed Cloud, and Denison Witmer, among others.

Mcluskyism / Mcluskyism [Limited Edition],Mclusky,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c406ea9e61561daa8063/1:1/w_160/8495b5f4.jpg,2006-02-28 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11777-mcluskyism-mcluskyism-expanded-edition/,Too Pure,"To be honest, I never really thought Mclusky had much of a chance. Given that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of ""evil indie rock,"" Mclusky could be best be classified as ""asshole indie rock""-- direct, obnoxious, and unapologetic. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material into one awkward and probably excessive package. Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, booming drums, fuzzed out bass, and Andy Falkous's curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these particular songs comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by Mclusky is infectious. A few of the better songs from the band's rough-and-tumble debut My Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours get the A-sides disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, Mclusky Do Dallas. ""Whoyouknow"", ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"", ""To Hell With Good Intentions"", and ""Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"" are taut, merciless, and concise, perfectly captured by Steve Albini's similarly taut, merciless, and concise production. The non-album single ""There Ain't No Fool in Ferguson"" is my favorite here, coupling a television commercial-catchy guitar line with playful alliteration to the tune of ""hopeless hepatitis piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole."" And then there are the other discs. Compilations like this are always a no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively sold short their own career. If the B-sides fall substantially short of the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting their best foot forward. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called ""C-sides""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor, showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band. As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of Mcluskyism works better as an archive than it does a unified listening experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice ""C-side"" like ""Colour March"" or ""Cradling"" on a mix CD, but most people will find the condensed version of Mcluskyism to be just right. At one disc, it's a gleeful kick in the ribs. At three, it's a slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm.",,8.4,
Soft and Loud,Philip Samartzis,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d05e6ef95969320e1e/1:1/w_160/30f0ca29.gif,2006-02-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7846-soft-and-loud/,MicrophonicMicrophonic,"Call me ""bush league"" or whatever, but I prefer my WFMU Record Fair Xenakis or Stockhausen finds without their liners-- less technical headache, more mystery. Plus, they come cheaper. Well, Philip Samartzis' label, Plates of Sound, has sprung for interminable (and pretty) liner notes, in two languages and character sets; this is money they could have kept and spent on a little more mystery. Here's your quick gloss: Samartzis, a professor or something at Melbourne's RMIT University, went to Tokyo and field-recorded a bunch of everyday type spots. He then laboriously sound-designed the fuck out of his tape, presented it as an eight speaker, quad-sound installation in 2001, and released it as Soft and Loud, first to CD (on his own label, Microphonics), and now to vinyl. It is, according to Samartzis, a narrative documentary type thing that is also democratic, because the mix is layered such that rather than forcing one particular sound or ""sweet spot"" of reception, the listener can wander around in the sound as he or she chooses. On the aural upside, Samartzis' ability to clamp down on his crystalline samples varies inversely with his super-loose talking lips (and to be fair, the man helped found Australian pioneer turntable noise act Gum, and rocks with dudes like Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi). Dying-art musique concrète might feel too easy for your average MaxMSP G4 wielder, but here, Samartzis acts like he still has to splice his own tape reels. So Soft and Loud is less pastiched than painstakingly sequenced, which sells the whole day-spent-on-a-foreign-park-bench chronology he writes to death on paper. Electronic birdcalls wander in, as do pedestrian crossing noises, dudes yelling-- lots of silence, which only makes sense-- filled out with gentle forest and city clicking. It's nice, in the CDR era, to trust a composer. His passing train builds smartly into warbling winds, or wet hisses dissolve into a gong; sounds get French-intellectual in the way they inter-refer and derive meaning entirely in juxtaposition. Sure, he does that whole ""isn't this pre-recorded chestnut salesman's jingling sales-pitch actually musical?"" thing that battles (probably) long dead philistines, but his sense of texture and pace far outweighs his own sense of importance. The myriad little discretes stack well; Samartzis has invented a wildly dense, interwoven but calm logic for the worlds he recorded. And if that reads too pretentious for ya, figure this: If you haven't been to Tokyo, sounds like you should really go.","Occasional Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi collaborator presents an academic study in found sound and digital manipulation.

The Maginot Line,Raising the Fawn,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3265e6ef959693205a5/1:1/w_160/d93b2587.jpg,2006-02-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6954-the-maginot-line/,Sonic Unyon,"Never let it be said that John Crossingham doesn't appreciate public displays of affection: In 2004, the part-time Broken Social Scene guitarist proposed to his fiancé onstage during the band's Coachella set in front of some 10,000 people. But when it comes to the math-rock lullabies he creates with his own band, Raising the Fawn, he's a much more insular soul. Unlike so many bands orbiting planet BSS, Raising the Fawn isn't just another occasion for the Arts & Crafts extended family to get together for group handclaps. There are no backup vocal turns from Feist, no guest appearances by Brendan Canning on shakers. If anything, Crossingham is a rarity among his BSS peers for favoring a less-is-more approach: Since its formation in 2000, Raising the Fawn has downsized from a four-piece to a trio, and effectively trimmed any fat inhibiting a more powerful rock approach. The band's self-titled 2001 debut was a delicate collection of porcelain pop songs that Crossingham openly admitted was one big long soppy mash note to his girl (ex-Fawn drummer Lesa Hannah); 2004's more accomplished The North Sea closely followed in Mogwai's footsteps, lamenting long-distance love and eulogizing the dead (Crossingham's grandmother and Acetone frontman Richie Lee included) in lurching 10-minute movements. But if new album The Maginot Line, the first Fawn full-length recorded as a trio, is decidedly less sentimental or cohesive in tone than its predecessors, it's all the braver for it. Following a minute of sustained feedback (generously given its own title, ""Pyotr""), Maginot opens in earnest with ""Carbon Paper"", a flurry of crashing grandeur that, like Death Cab's ""The New Year"" or Trail of Dead's ""Relative Ways"", heralds a newfound sense of clarity and confidence. While the latter band would've seemed like a laughably incongruous reference point for the Fawn five years ago, these days both strive for a similar balance of melody and menace, elegance and ugliness. Here, the Fawn's own gradual evolution is reflected in a handful of amorphous six-minute mini-epics: The title track sends Crossingham's coo on an upward surge of Sonic Youth-ish twinkles and tribal floor-tom thumps, slowly accruing a militaristic intensity before locking into nasty gutter blues; centerpiece track ""Christmastime in the Fields"" begins as a faint sea shanty that hitches onto a sinister bass pulse to brace us for the turbulence to come; and ""Until It Starts Again"" starts like a standard-issue Slint-esque prowl, only to evolve as it hits its soul-clap chorus. Where Broken Social Scene's narcotic-pop floats effortlessly skyward, Raising the Fawn strive for the same heights through a painstaking, brick-by-brick effort: guitars short out, harmonies crack, and calloused fingers grind fretboards with each abrupt chord change. Unsurprisingly, the songs here with more modest intents-- the straight jangle ballad ""The Cloak and the Veil"", or the sullen, Sebadoh-like denouement ""Nocturne No. 2""-- don't inspire the same degree of emotional investment, never tapping into the band's talent for subtle transformation. The Maginot Line is a suitably precarious, frequently thrilling high-wire act for a band that, back home in Toronto, can open for anybody from Mogwai to the Wrens. Still, Raising the Fawn's singular identity is truly revealed when they refuse to fully identify with either camp.","Third album from the full-time project of Broken Social Scene's John Crossingham is the trio's most expansive to date.

Untouchable Sound,Make-Up,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c379eb335119a49ed700/1:1/w_160/7da888f2.jpg,2006-02-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5054-untouchable-sound/,Drag City,"Recorded in 2000 but inexplicably shelved until now, Untouchable Sound is the second of the Make-Up's live albums, with a faux live LP also in their catalog. Though their studio albums and singles were great (the singles a little greater), the band's ratio of studio-to-live records is now equal for good reason: live performance was where the Make-Up thrived. If you weren't there, here's reason #2 to kick yourself for it. To many people, that's all the live album really functions as: a souvenir to an event you likely never attended, like a program to a play or baseball game you missed, with the bonus of crowd noise and songs you already love recorded in shittier quality. I still favor the live record as document, an etch in time of certain lineups, setlists, potential versatility (read as: ""jamming""), and possibly some entertaining banter from the band (if you like hearing Ian Svenonious say ""Yeah?"" and ""hold on,"" oh boy, you're in luck). However, the Make-Up are even fucking with the record's historical value, making any details frustratingly vague. The liner notes only tell you it was recorded ""one day in 2000,"" the included description of the show holds no basis in reality, and even between-song thanks to the other acts on the bill are curiously backmasked instead of edited out. Clearly, careful history is not the band's strong suit; they're more intent on subverting their place in it. Live records are hallway fodder in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame; Svenonious, Michelle Mae and crew would likely storm through its doors spray-painting the walls, one of them holding a boombox blasting Prince tapes while they did it. Untouchable Sound doesn't have the same thrill as the off-the-cuff sneak previews of Destination: Love or After Dark, but it does boast a more familiar setlist and a more commanding grasp of their signature sound-- more minimal while making better use of organ, thin guitars, and throbbing bass. Just from the relentless hammering and dramatic pauses of the crowd-baiting intro, their dynamic presence cuts through speakers. Indeed, something still crackles dangerously from the corpse of the Make-Up, and it isn't their brand of irony (say ""gospel yeh-yeh"" with a straight face, I dare you). Their languid ""Wade in the Water"" simmers and spatters, and then-new tracks like ""Born on the Floor"" and ""White Belt"" are towering infernos left from their ruthless desecration of funk and soul. Just as Hendrix so loved his guitar he had to burn it in front of thousands, so the-Make-Up had to tear the music they loved a new orifice on stage and glaze it in irony to pay it necessary tribute. The Make-Up have long been my indie rock defilers of choice, far more lively and sharper-fanged than Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, wirier and more visceral than any of Svenonius' other bands. Why hide behind a veil of irony and obfustication? Why wait so long to put the record out? They may have been celebrating cliche, but to think the act was empty-- or needs the easy defense of irony-- is a mistake, especially given the immediate influence they had on their peers (I'm not talking about the [International] Noise Conspiracy). We've seen a lot of trends and revivals crop up and wilt in a half-decade of recent history, but despite the band's best efforts, the Make-Up have cemented their place in it.","Few indie bands warrant a third live album, but the Make-Up were famously better on-stage than in-studio: If you weren't there, this is reason #3 to kick yourself.

The Loon,Tapes 'n Tapes,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b89d034d5c69bf3af7/1:1/w_160/8a133bf2.jpg,2006-02-27 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8314-the-loon/,Ibid,"You won't find a tougher sell on neoclassicism than yours truly, so imagine my surprise how this strummy slab from the thrift racks has become one of my early '06 faves. Minneapolis-based Tapes 'n Tapes do it by the book-- that's to say, off the cuff, taking cues from indie legends and newies alike with star-pupil rigor, but never sweating the exam. Here's a charismatic, playfully slipshod band unconcerned with making all the loose ends meet up, audacious enough to leave the dot-connecting to us. But then, never quite knowing which Feelies riff or Malkmus vocal turn or, hell, CYHSY organ sound these guys will strike with next is precisely what makes The Loon such a rich, participatory, and eminently repeatable experience. Tapes 'n Tapes kneel before Pavement, Wire, Beach Boys, and Pixies, bearing their influences more publically than notebook logo sketches. But facing the task of averting obviousness, they play the uncool card: ""The Iliad"" dresses its keystones in afro-MIDI percussion, cuica and humorously fake timbale, its garb recalling the shy kid in sculpture class who could be a hipster if not for those Sketchers: Are the kicks a defense mechanism, ironic one-upmanship, or just a really good deal at TJ Maxx? It's all part of their unpretentious approachability and charm. Tandem tracks ""In Houston"" and ""Manitoba"" lounge out with surprise vibe melodies, incongruously smooth counterpoints to an otherwise gruff sound. But the move doesn't raise eyebrows, instead fostering a mellow whiskey-belly warmth. Inconsistency, Tapes 'n Tapes understand, adds character and colorizes personality; it also keeps listeners off-balance and wanting more. If their aesthetic choices sometimes bewilder, the vocals hit nearer mindfuck. Resistant to the emotionally soaring, soft-spot-as-high-point bone their forebears never hesitated to throw, Tapes 'n Tapes seethe smarm and snark. ""I've been a better lover with your mother,"" frontman Josh Grier snarls over restless, incorrigible strums on ""Cowbell"". But while smack talk's good for a snicker, the band choose introspection over in-joke on ""Insistor"", whose initially hushed, scat-quick vocals rise to meet the song's surging polka rhythm for a transcendent chorus: ""And when you rush I'll call your name like Harvard Square holds all inane."" Delivered with just enough desperation to defeat its inscrutability, the line's sweet as Nutella from the jar, and probably healthier. Unknowable lyrics aren't the only device Tapes 'n Tapes use to summon their primary influence (ahem, Pavement); the band's strict strums-over-riffs philosophy activates last-decade memories, too. ""10 Gallon Ascots"", alternately the album's softest and loudest cut, rides a furtive, sneaking rhythm that seems channelled straight from ""Stop Breathin'"", while ""In Houston"" fuses its ""Two States"" two-beat stomp to the record's most Malkmusian vocal articulation, an allusion so overt (and dead-on) it verges on memorial. But the band forgoes their heroes' ascetic brevity-- they're just too happy to wail, and too hyperactive to be stopped. ""Crazy Eights"" balloons from 90-second instrumental placeholder to something more complex after suddenly wormholing from casual swing to overdriven straight-time; ""Manitoba"" shakes off its blissful pre-dawn slumber to kick an ecstatic, vibraphone-free coda. While strong faith is always convincing, Tapes 'n Tapes succeed by practice as much as passion, articulating a conventional vocabulary with rare erudition. As such, The Loon brings something for everybody. Not that the band's diplomacy is a kowtow: Loving is just their quaint way of asking for love. Credit yourself if you can get down with a program offering up so many been-there-done-that indicators. Or better, credit the band for avoiding the toothless mush that typically results from this sort of populism, and arriving instead at a fresh vision through eloquent pastiche. ","Kneeling before Pavement, Wire, Beach Boys, and Pixies at rock's canonical altar, this scrappy Minneapolis four-piece proudly wear their influences on-sleeve, shunning hipster malaise and manic experimentation for hook after addictively anthemic hook. Their total lack of pretentiousness is a breath of fresh air: The Loon brings something for everyone.

Strangers/Swinging Doors and The Bottle Let Me Down / I'm a Lonesome Fugitive/Branded / Sing Me Back Home/The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde / Mama Tried/Proud of What I Am / Hag/Someday We'll Look Back,Merle Haggard,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c03eea9e61561daa7bae/1:1/w_160/739c891f.jpg,2006-02-27 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11752-strangersswinging-doors-and-the-bottle-let-me-down-im-a-lonesome-fugitivebranded-sing-me-back-homethe-legend-of-bonnie-and-clyde-mama-triedproud-of-what-i-am-hagsomeday-well-look-back/,Capitol,"Few singers, country or otherwise, sound so downhearted as Merle Haggard. He specialized (still does, actually) in barroom laments that worry a sentiment threadbare in only a few verses, before moving on to a just-slightly-different sentiment in a new song. His lyrics, which expound on the typical honkytonk subjects of prison, poverty, sobriety, and doomed romance, are dense with wrenching wordplay and reversals of phrases that seem to heighten his self-loathing, turning his misery into a joke so half-hearted it'll make you cry just as easily as smile. But it's his delivery that really sells the heartache. Instead of airing his emotions publicly, Haggard stoppers them with a formidably stoic front. Crucially, his masculine façade always sounds on the verge of crumbling, but not even a line like ""I'll give my everything, but you don't even try"" (from ""You Don't Even Try"") can unleash the flood. Haggard's tears always remain private, but rather than closing off these songs, his brave-faced delivery makes them all the more sympathetic, which is their most important quality. Country music is best when listeners can relate to the songs and invest them with their own experiences-- a notion Haggard obviously buys into. He even lays it all out in ""Someone Told My Story"", explaining the relationship between singer and audience better than any critic could: I played a brand-new record on the jukebox
And I scarcely could believe the song I heard
It told of how you left me for another
It was almost like I'd written every word Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you done me wrong
Someone told my story in a song That song is from Haggard's 1967 album I'm a Lonesome Fugitive, one of ten included in Capitol's generous reissue set: five discs containing two albums each (four of the ten have never been available on CD before), along with more than 20 bonus tracks. Listening to them chronologically-- starting with Strangers in 1965 and ending with 1971's Someday We'll Look Back-- is like reading an epic American novel: Haggard has Twain's wit (no exaggeration), Steinbeck's eye for the vagaries of poor America, and Horatio Alger's bootstrap sentimentality. These albums are weighty with lyrical details drawn from Haggard's own life (his dirt-poor upbringing, rebellious adolescence, and numerous incarcerations, escapes, and marriages) and reveal an artist torn between his birthplace of California and his family's home in Oklahoma, between the familiarity of heartache and the suspected complacency of happiness, between the security of home and the lure of hopping that freight and seeing what's a little farther down the line. Perhaps ironically, for all his ramblin' ways, Haggard wasn't much of a boundary-pusher musically-- at least not like Willie Nelson or even Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound he helped to pioneer, following the leads of Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart, was more a product of circumstance and geography than of concerted innovation, and his blend of traditional country, honkytonk, jazz, and rock seems fully developed on his very first songs. As a result, there's only a little deviation in sound between these 10 albums, and Haggard doesn't stray too far from his very traditional songwriting approach or rough-and-tumble subject matter. Nor does he need to. His sound is sturdy, his lyrics surprisingly complex, his structures perfectly concise. Plus, most of these songs, while not outright autobiographical, carry the weight of true experience, which makes them all the more relatable. Released in 1965 and 1966 respectively, Strangers and Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down (the latter named for its two singles) establishes a template for nearly every song that follows: an effective formula of humor and pathos, earnest self-deprecation and randy braggadocio, with no wasted notes or words, and even fewer pretensions. Most of these tracks-- but especially these earlier numbers-- sound like they've been devised and developed in front of live audiences, their get-to-the-point directness and standout melodies all calculated to get people off their barstools and onto the dance floor, whether they're slow-dancing to ""I'll Trade All of My Tomorrows"" or scooting scuffed boots to ""Please Mr. DJ"". Haggard's band, dubbed the Strangers after his first big hit, sounds road-hardened on rollicking numbers like ""The Girl Turned Ripe"" (next line: ""and pickers came today""), barely bottled by the strictures of the songs. They're reluctantly holding back, and occasionally they do cut loose: An incessant piano boogie drives the randy and upbeat ""If You Want to Be My Woman"" (off I'm a Lonesome Fugitive), and pedal-steel tears drip wearily on ""I Threw Away the Rose"" (from Branded), and the energetic, near-reggae ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" (from Sing Me Back Home) sounds like it might have been the band's favorite live number. Pairing these albums two per disc is economic, but the choices reveal the gentle disparities between them: Strangers and Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down are well matched, but I'm a Lonesome Fugitive overshadows Branded, and Hag sounds like a warm-up to Someday We'll Look Back. Furthermore, this format reinforces the uniformity of sound across Haggard's early albums. So the banjo that kicks off ""The Legend of Bonnie & Clyde"" is incredibly jolting, not just because it's the first time that instrument has appeared on a Haggard song, but moreover because it reveals just how deceptively basic his sound is. He and his band were able to make the traditional setup of guitar, bass, drums, piano, and voice sound like so much more. But on Bonnie & Clyde he starts to branch out a little, toying around with arrangements and expanding his Bakersfield-based sound. A short acoustic guitar theme two-steps through ""Fool's Castle"", and a deep piano melody-- the left hand of rock'n'roll's boogie rhythm-- puts the question mark in ""Will You Visit Me on Sundays?"" As a result, Bonnie & Clyde is perhaps this set's most diverse album, showcasing the breadth of his sound and the depth of his material. Mama Tried, however, is the highlight. Starting off with the majestically regretful title track-- which is reportedly Haggard's apology to his mother for his wayward youth-- the album collects some of his most assured and accomplished songs, including a chugging cover of Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"". Pride in What I Am continues that dynamic, making that disc the most solid of these reissues. Kicking off the final disc, Hag never really gets its footing, although ""The Sidewalks of Chicago"" is one of Haggard's most devastating singles. Compared to that scattershot collection, Someday We'll Look Back almost sounds like a concept album: Songs like ""One Row at a Time"", ""California Cottonfields"", and ""Tulare Dust"" recount the Haggard family's move from Oklahoma to Oildale, California, where they lived in a converted boxcar. Although he was born in California, Haggard felt like the Midwest was his home, and Someday We'll Look Back addresses this as if it's his definitive conflict, the source of all his nervy wanderlust. This final disc also introduces a new facet of Haggard and perhaps the most notorious: the outspoken, self-justifying, flag-waving, hippie-baiting conservative that was made famous by ""Okee from Muskogee"". Only a few songs here are politically charged, and those that target hippies, like ""I've Done It All"" and ""Big Time Annie's Square"", make it a class issue, treating them in much the same way early country artists ridiculed the snooty upper crust: For Haggard, hippies had the luxury for their leftist leanings, which conflicts with his blue-collar beliefs. However, on the whole, these reissues give politics a pass, omitting ""Okee"" when it would have been easy to sneak his most notorious hit on as a bonus track. It's a strategic decision. Without the looming shadow of Haggard's legitimate politics (which, it could be argued, have denied him his rightful popular legacy), the music becomes the primary focus, revealing the magnitude of Haggard's impact and arguing persuasively that these 10 albums are the wellspring of modern country music.","Capitol finally gets around to issuing 10 full-lengths from country legend Merle Haggard's 1965-71 peak era.

Kings & Queens,The National Trust,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b0eb335119a49ed784/1:1/w_160/ee72fe00.jpg,2006-02-26 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5724-kings-queens/,Thrill Jockey,"Google ""indie rock"" and you'll summon more than nine million matches. Even ""indie metal,"" ""indie folk,"" and ""indie jazz"" ratchet up at least 200,000 hits each. But ""indie funk""? Just 26,100. ""Indie r&b;"" fares even worse, at under a thousand connections. This dearth of DIY lovermen and horn snappers is unfortunate, but it makes sense considering the notion of indie-ness is often typified by a subversion of the talent-equals-success trajectory. With outlandish, popular champions from Prince to George Clinton to Rick James, funk seems to require an acute set of raw chops and shameless star-quality to truly transcend. Thrill Jockey's National Trust try for an elusive indie-funk maneuver with their sophomore album, but the Chicago-based duo largely succumbs to the pitfalls of their lonely genre. Stumbling through twisty bass 'n' falsetto excursions, the band lacks the adequate songwriting gusto and ego-fueled panache to turn its sexed-up conga jams into true bottom-dwelling fiends. Give them credit, though-- these guys are really going for it, indie ethos be damned. Just one look at the album's cover, which features main men Neil Rosario and Mark Henning striking silly poses in front of a couple pink elevators, makes their commitment to the soul spectacle apparent. Unfortunately, their idea of spectacle isn't exactly spectacular. With Kings & Queens, the Trust siphon out the psych-tinged 70s singer/songwriter leanings of their 2002 debut, Dekaggar, keeping only the elements that make asses move. The pair's penchant for over-orchestration-- Dekaggar infamously took over 500 hours to record-- remains, and more often than not, hinders Kings' libidinous ambitions. Clearly, these boys can't grasp the concept of ""say when."" Just sample the stupid-long instrument list: bongos, congas, flute, piccolo, synth, clavinet, vibes, wood block, and glockenspiel. If R. Kelly has proven anything, it's that a classic funk can be gleaned from the sound of a single water drop. So, these admitted Kells admirers (they even recruited His Trapped-ness' engineer, Abel Garibaldi, to help produce this disc) should know better than to smother the painfully aimless ""Show and Tell"" and over-fed ""Stages"" with undue slops of rhythmic goop. Aside from the creepy, mouth-breathing intro track, nearly every song on Kings lugs on for more than five minutes; in most cases, they hardly contain enough passable ideas to warrant three. Still, the group's indulgences crank just right twice, on the electro-bounce of ""It's Just Cruel"" and the Caribbean-dream sway of ""Canday's Away"". Kings' slickness is mostly wasted, but works in favor of ""It's Just Cruel"". ""This 45 is better than the things before,"" sing the duo in pointed falsetto, and in this instance, their conflation of Isley Brothers-smooth and Rick James-strut is worthy of comparison to lofty forbears. Whereas elsewhere, lines like ""sweat's gonna getcha/ Your body's hot to measure"" sound stuck somewhere between irony and kitsch, here the Trust convincingly enunciates such slick, primal urges. Likewise, every chime and mouth percussion punctuation of ""Canday's Away"" contributes to its sexed-up longing, allowing the mellow melter to wallow in the fatalistic undercurrent of early-hour lust. Indie-funk is a dangerous proposition. On Kings & Queens, chasing the groove sometimes leads to jammy voids filled with wonky synths and bouts of exercise-machine-infomercial bullshit. But it's also a worthy proposition because, as the glimpses here prove, there are few things more undeniable than a thick, icy-hot groove.","Second full-length from Thrill Jockey's cheeseball indie R&B; duo fares only marginally better than Har Mar. Maybe there's a reason this stuff usually gets left to the majors?

They Mean Us,The Ladies,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf8ea9e61561daa780b/1:1/w_160/60825499.jpg,2006-02-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5003-they-mean-us/,Temporary Residence,"Rob Crow is dipping his Pinback chocolate in Zach Hill's Hella peanut butter, and as these crossover-side-projects-containing-culty-stars fare, the Ladies' own-merit appeal falls into that moist pueblo between the Postal Service and Go Back Snowball, alongside Loose Fur-- which is a decent vantage point for sitting and wondering why Electronic stank so awfully. The great news is that the Ladies avoid ""In the Fishtank"" syndrome: While those hybrid experiments usually resulted in acts indulging each other's indulgent streaks to record geologically patient jam-bandy unsmooth jazz, guitarist Crow and drummer Hill tighten each other. Literally half of these tracks resemble traditional hummable songs, though they fitfully switch modes and are sequenced to bleed into the avant-something bits of subdued noise-punk, such as the Public Enemy nod ""Black Metal in the Hour of Starbucks"". (Wait, what is ""subdued noise-punk"" supposed to be? Mild chaos? Prog fusion? ""Prusion""?) By now you've deducted that They Mean Us is hardly pop. Crow may have ""O.C.""-palatable pipes, but he chose the path less emo years ago, and Hill, um, he kind of can't be stopped. Your esteem for this release may well depend on your capacity to withstand Hill's virtuosity. If one were typing about this disc for The New Yorker or the Times, one couldn't be blamed for taking the sweeping time-capsule, pop-anthropology, Da Capo-anthology approach: What does it all mean that there exists in the marketplace a one-man rhythm section who practically solos non-stop? How can one fathom the old communal fantasy of ""bandness"" when the individual so dominates and self-isolates? Is a genius always going to be cast as a fascist underdog in a monoculture? Are we so benumbed by a multiplicity of entertainments that talent has to distinguish itself via relentless, intimidating explosiveness? How totally inappropriate is even a hint of a suicide bomber analogy? Have we cut away the fatty shanks of the bash-ba-donk, lollygagging Clinton-era drum style in favor of the all-skeleton, defender-Bush percussion model? Etc. Hill's skill can wear the listener down, but it's never repellent; he never seems like the sticks-and-skins equivalent of the post-Mariah vocal note-gasming that goes down during that Karaoke Simon show on Fox. The fatigue that Hill can cultivate is similar to what would happen if one stared too long at a chainsaw juggler, or watched that Police Academy sound-effects guy approximate the Peloponnesian War. There's something eerily casual about Hill's stunt barrage. I've just never heard tunes anchored by beats that sound like codeine-y elephant farts, or like a vintage Mercedes growing a goiter. Let not Rob Crow be forgotten: His guitar work here blends calculus-rock strumming with thick trad riffs. To namecheck, ""So Much for the Fourth Wall"" suggests the glacial cinematic whomp of Aereogramme, while ""And Them"" visits the Seattle sludge trough. The assassin confession ""Non-Threatening"" can't help but Kinsella itself, and much of the rest suggests a teenage, antic-but-expansive Sabbath without the plod. Consumer reports: Five tracks are around a minute long, but each prefers risk to mere competence. Besides, one track takes up over a third of the album's running time. (It's lazily titled, but for a mandatory psycho-freakout, ""Mandatory Psycho-Freakout"" is an honorable mandatory psycho-freakout.) Until the day that Xiu Xiu teams with Richard X, the Ladies' rampant precision will suffice.","Temporary Residence issues this debut collaboration between Pinback singer/guitarist Rob Crow and Hella drummer Zach Hill.

Rideau,Tape,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73413d1975652139367/1:1/w_160/c54d573d.jpg,2006-02-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7939-rideau/,Häpna,"Broadly speaking, Swedish trio Tape are a throwback to the moredeliberate end of late-90s post-rock. A number of elements line upjust so: the Reich-inspired use of repetition, the blurring oftraditional instruments and computer processing; a reflexive drifttoward the ""cinematic""; an occasional willingness to let songs stretchon longer than someone who grew up listening to punk would imaginenecessary. For their third album, Rideau, Tape even enlisted productiorhelp from Marcus Schmickler, whose first two one-man-band records asPluramon fit snuggly next to Tortoise on an arranged-by-mood CD shelf. I still return to certain records from this world (including some byTortoise and Pluramon), but considering how much blah music the scenegenerated, the immediate associations surrounding Tape fail toinspire. It's an obstacle worth getting past, though, because Tape aredoing a lot of things right, and their music is far more engaging tharyou would guess by flipping through a catalog description. Rideau isflat-out pretty, which helps a lot, and Tape has a consistently""on"" compositional sense that builds tension and moves pieceslogically along. A good thing, too, since this record contains theirlongest tracks to date, three of which are more than 11 minutes. All virtues are present in opener ""Sunrefrain"", where graduallyunfolding bass, organ, and guitar meander up a mountain pass thatleads to a majestic surge of horns at the peak, a hair-raising refrairthat sounds something like the fanfare from Jóhann Jóhannsson'sVirðulegu forsetar. It's the kind of track that rewards patience withan epic payoff. Good will duly established, thevibes come out on ""A Spire"", as Tape follow a brief snatch of melodyas far as it wants to go (which turns out to be the 11:45 mark).Schmickler's role here is key, as he carefully folds in variationsthat remain at the threshold of audibility from bar to bar but accruepretty serious force over longer stretches. He's also got an ear forsubtle but effective processing, cloaking familiar instruments irdistortion to create a sense of dislocation that adds depth to theproject. It's a good match that leads to Tape's best music. The two previousrecords are enjoyable, no question, but the drama here trumpseverything else in the catalog. Despite its seemingly demanding tracklengths, Rideau is the Tape album to start with.","On their finest release yet for prestigious Swedish experimental label Häpna, admired post-rock trio Tape breathe new life into a long-exhausted genre.

Call of the Mastodon,Mastodon,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d6c0084474cd0c356c/1:1/w_160/b908d0d2.jpg,2006-02-26 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5144-call-of-the-mastodon/,Relapse,"Mastodon's set at the Bowery Ballroom last May, consisting mainly of material from their 2004 watershed Leviathan, was one of the more amazingly realized live moments I witnessed in 2005. In what felt like a series of sucker punches, epic after epic from the Atlanta quartet's second album was rendered with hardcore tightness and punctuated by bassist and vocalist Troy Sanders' puff-chested salty Ahab salutes. The band had signed to Warner around that time; by default, I envisioned the set as a swaggering big-city climax after years of grunt work. Close to a year later, with Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher, guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds, and jazz-as-fuck drummer Brann Dailor readying their major label debut, Relapse offers Call of the Mastodon, an official release of the band's first recording session, remastered by original producer Matt Washburn. Fans will recognize five of these songs from 2001's Lifesblood EP. The other four tracks have never been available on CD, but if you look hard enough, you can possibly track them down on 7"" vinyl. A fan of warts-and-all, I prefer the older, muddier recordings to the new, shiny constructions. Yes, the upgrades do sound bigger and cleaner, but the energy is somehow snuffed, the overall arc a bit bassy and flat. If you haven't heard early Mastodon, don't expect Voivod echoes, the grandiosity of Remission's ""Elephant Man"" and ""Trainwreck"", or anything resembling Leviathan's waterlogged, 13-minute ""Heart's Alive"" or gauzy, acoustic-inflected ""Joseph Merrick."" Tellingly, the Call of the Mastodon set clocks in at less than half an hour, whereas Leviathan's 10 tracks unfurl in almost twice that amount of time. Beside the smarter compositional structures, Hinds and Sanders have evolved as vocalists; the two are now capable of moving between scowls and clearer enunciations. They've also upped the lyrical ante. Although the ocean has always been a consistent theme of theirs, these pieces are more about the drowning breathlessness of a snarl than linking choruses to Moby Dick. Close listens can churn up a few nascent seedlings of later developments, but during this early point in the band's career they were more narrowly focused and brandished less distinctive chops. The first thing Lifesblood initiates will notice is the lack of samples. I'm not one to usually give a shit about any film dialogue opening a rock anthem, but I miss these soundbytes, especially the One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest crescendo of ""Shadows That Move"". The song's dual guitar haul remains one of the band's finest, but the whirlpool vocals (Poseidon with laryngitis) have been placed a bit lower in the mix. ""We Built This Come Death""'s caterwauls are the record's strongest, somehow psychedelic and Sabbathian (and, well, Soundgardenian) in their harmonizing howl. The true Lifesblood gem, though, is ""Battle at Sea"", which offers the purest taste of the band's exploratory future. Here, various vocal textures (screamo, death metal, waling wall) are placed in a tempest of ascending scales, and punctuated with a bassy sea knot, swordfighting guitars, and prog breakdowns. Again, the vocals have been pulled back a bit and blended more into their surroundings. After repeat listens, I still appreciate the older, rawer version's dry rot and the slithery scream that occasionally rears its head above the wave churn. My favorite of the non-Lifesblood tracks is ""Deep Sea Creature"", which sports an elaborate guitar intro that quickly shifts into a full-on murky, heaving shouter. Two minutes short, ""Thank You for This"" also showcases some Metallica-esque guitarisms and more tuneful vocal lines alongside the typical throat rot; unfortunately, there are also a few very typical metal tropes, including de rigueur crescendos, super speedy hi-hat taps, and ho-hum mosh parts. ""Slickleg"" is more impressive, beckoning a mammoth trapped in ice while squelching acoustic tendencies with immediate, squealing thrash riffs and drums rolling starboard. There's no doubt that the stuff on Call of the Mastodon is more impressive than many bands' early (or even later) catalogues, but metal-to-the-pedal isn't the crew's strong point. Throughout their career, the boys have continually progressed, so while looking backward at this point may be of historical interest, who wants to rock out to the second rate? Those who don't consider themselves Mastodon diehards might as well wait for the next leap forward on the timeline. Judging from the trek thus far, I imagine it's gonna be seismic.","Atlanta-based metal mavericks leave Relapse Records for the majors, but remember their roots with this remastered offering of their earliest recordings.

With Strings: Live at Town Hall,Eels,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0aeb335119a49ecb8e/1:1/w_160/93844738.gif,2006-02-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2689-with-strings-live-at-town-hall/,Vagrant,"Double albums are the gateway drugs of rock music. Sure, all the other bands say you can't get addicted, and they may be right-- after all, how many bands have done two double albums? But what those ""friends"" don't tell you is that the double album is the first step on the path to rock star excess, leading inevitably to hiring Phil Spector as a producer, a dalliance with some kind of exotic religion, and the sudden compulsion to do something ""multimedia."" Years later, you find yourself choreographing a rock opera performed on ice, and thinking, ""Oh, if only I hadn't made that seemingly innocent choice to not edit my album down to one disc. Woe!"" Is it too late to save Eels from this path of meteoric destruction, now that they've foolishly indulged in the double album with last year's Blinking Lights and Other Revelations? Early evidence is discouraging, as they already exhibit two symptoms of long-term effects upon good judgment: the borderline innocuous ""live album,"" and the much more worrisome ""with strings."" Such words often portend the addition of Michael Kamen to the rolodex, a move towards Moody Blues-style hyper-orchestration, or tour dates at the Acropolis. Fortunately, Eels letterman Mark Everett (more commonly known as just ""E"") is partial to minimal arrangements, a tendency that keeps him from ordering up 75-piece orchestra buckets and slathering crescendos onto every chorus. In fact, the ""strings"" of this album's title are merely a humble quartet, and despite second billing, their contributions are kept subtle, balanced well against the pile of musical toys that E and his unclassically trained companions pluck and bang. There aren't any overtures or Copland quotes, just 19 Eels songs (mostly from Blinking Lights) and three covers, rearranged for a drum-less orchestra-geek lineup. The scarcity of percussion on all but a handful of With Strings' tracks lends the entire set a ghostly feel, which works both for and against E's vision. On one hand, here's hoping Town Hall was a seated venue; unless there were some serious pyrotechnics, it may have been a rough haul for audience members working on a short night's sleep. Yet, the sparse arrangements turn out some fascinating moments, with the strings often used as background color while singing saw, pump organ, or vibraphone hits take the starring role. A medley of ""Flyswatter"" with the obligatory (but disassembled) ""Novocaine for the Soul"" successfully wraps all these elements together, a stretch that sounds spookily improvised in contrast to the chart-reading restrictions of the set's bulk. Still, the most electric moments come when the band momentarily shakes off the drear and lets loose: the sharp found-object drumming of Blinking Lights' finest track ""Trouble With Dreams,"" or the respectful cover of the Left Banke's ""Pretty Ballerina"", which allows the strings to finally swoop. I'm déjà vu-ing myself here, but these sparkly, weird, subversive pop moments far outshine the too-frequent occasions in which E fancies himself a folk singer, obsessed with working-class imagery and leaning too hard on his Velcro rasp of a voice. So go ahead and grant the Eels an exemption for going the orchestra tour route; the additional personnel justifies their paychecks by saving this live album from being a rote greatest-hits-with-crowd-noise exercise. The record's occasional dragging moments stem less from Boston Pops syrup than from E's maudlin stumbles, or the sometimes oppressively uniform melancholy he prefers. For now, Eels have put the brakes on the slide down the slippery slope of rock clichés, but beware: the lingering effects of double-album experimentation aren't so easily undone.","Striking while the double-album iron's hot, Eels follow last year's Blinking Lights with this intimate string quartet-backed recording of recent material and covers.

Everyone Into Position,Oceansize,by: Cory D.

The band stitches together a patchwork of styles-- alternative rock, riff-heavy modern hardcore, ethereal post rock, scream-filled metal-- that don't really blend but instead just seem to sidle up beside one another, varying extensively from track to track. There are powerful moments throughout, from intense bouts of noise and vocal wails, to quiet, serene ambience, but tying it all together somehow makes it seem watered down and banal. The album begins on a dark note with the tribal-esque drumming and mystical guitar of ""The Charm Offensive"". Unfortunately, the vocals are straight out of 90s alternative rock, which is fitting as the song moves through a ponderous grunge groove that the swirling guitars can't quite rescue. ""Heaven Alive"" continues the trend of by-the-numbers rock, with the wah-wah pedal dominating the guitar lines. In fact, the band doesn't really let on that there's more than meets the eye until the first few aggressive seconds of ""A Homage to Shame"". Atonal hardcore blasts segue into a relatively bland verse, but there are more layers working here: Heavy power chords, light, ethereal leads, keyboards, and billowing vocals breathe life into the formula, and by the end, everything has exploded into a chaotic mix of wailing guitars and buried vocal screeches. Thankfully, the band breaks through the tedium on both the beautiful ""Music for a Nurse""-- which could be mistaken for Explosions in the Sky's newer material if not for the soft vocals buried throughout the track-- and ""Mine Host"", which is built almost entirely on quiet ambience. The drums sound like they're being piped in from some other world, and vocal repetitions are hypnotic. My frustration, however, stems from how muddled up everything seems. There are tracks that are solid from start to finish, and others that beg to be skipped. Clearly, the band consists of some talented musicians; if only they could focus on the more original aspects of their music. Perfect examples are the album's two final tracks, ""You Can't Keep a Bad Man Down"" and ""Ornament/The Last Wrongs"". These two lengthy, dense tracks build their melodies with layers of instruments, and manage to meld styles into something coherent and powerful.","Indie band stitches together a patchwork of styles-- alternative rock, riff-heavy modern hardcore, ethereal post rock, scream-filled metal-- on its second LP.

Punches,World Leader Pretend,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aabeea9e61561daa5c31/1:1/w_160/52c7ff58.jpg,2006-02-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8810-punches/,Warner Bros.,"For all the ballyhoo surrounding this New Orleans trio's shout-out band name, there's not so much R.E.M. mimicry on Punches as major label muscle-flexing. In other words, the album sounds like money, not Green. After a slightly more rough and tumble indie debut, World Leader Pretend pull out all the stops here, making for vastly layered leviathans that aim even higher than the band's name hints-- even the filler tracks enjoy symphonic treatment. Nearly an hour of exhausting frippery and fanfare later, Punches still boasts its share of hooks and ideas, though sounds impersonal in its grandiosity. Much of this overwhelming effect stems from frontman Keith Ferguson's hammed-up vocals, an amalgamation of every headlining Live 8 artist with, go figure, a hint of Michael Stipe. Following suit, the band spans the breadth of the symphony-rock spectrum. ""The Masses"" and ""A Horse of a Different"" spin U2 histrionics with hard-edged guitars á la Muse. Creaky pianos usher in the verse, Ferguson croons a crooked minor melody and then bam!-- we're hit with everything from the Stratocaster to the Stradivarius on an all-or-nothing chorus. Funny as they sound on paper, the songs surprisingly stick, although some subtlety wouldn't hurt. The title track's slick mellotron and sneering guitars could pass as the Walkmen or Clinic if not for the instrumental maelstrom crowding every beat Ferguson's not singing on. Likewise, ""Tit for Tat"" attempts a bustling Sufjan arrangement that sounds goofy enough with sleigh bells and xylophone, let alone its relapse into a syrupy Britpop-era chorus. While noting how Punches misfires on its promise is a bit of a no-brainer, the album's technocratic bent makes for a paper tiger. Similar to Portland's Swords, World Leader Pretend pack a disproportionately small punch for their expansive sound, their hodgepodge of recognizable influences only artificially bolstering the songs' effectiveness. To their credit, the music trounces many contemporary bands' efforts to make entire albums from ""Boys Don't Cry"". Ferguson's songwriting is hyperactive, warding off a repetition of ideas, but there's still a lot of work to be done, and until the trio can muster some pizzazz of their own, they'll remain in the shadow of their touchstones-- a shadow they haven't exactly shied away from.","Named for an R.E.M. track, this New Orleans trio relased this much-ballyooed debut last year.

One Love at Studio One,Bob Marley & the Wailers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c375ea9e61561daa7f0c/1:1/w_160/e5e8ffb6.jpg,2006-02-23 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5674-one-love-at-studio-one/,Heartbeat,"Ask 50 Americans who they think of first when they hear the word ""reggae"" and there's a good chance all of them will say ""Bob Marley"". As Mark Richardson wrote on this website last month, the Legend compilation is ubiquitous in college dormitories and singularly likely to show up in the collections of people who only own a handful of CDs. People know his Island output, even if they only know the sliver of it presented on that disc, and for many, Marley is reggae-- most people think the Wailers were just the backing band. Well, books could and have been written on the incredible scope of Jamaican music beyond Marley, who for better or worse became its face to most of the world in the 1970s. You could also write tomes telling the story of the Wailers before Chris Blackwell took them global. The core of the Wailers was Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, and several other members, including Constantine Walker, Beverly Kelso, and Junior Braithwaite came and went over the course of the 60s, when the group recorded with various backing bands for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One label. Between 1963 and 1966, the Wailers cut more than 100 tracks for Dodd, and Heartbeat's One Love at Studio One gathers 40 of them plus one interesting rehearsal onto two discs. This release is essentially a spiffing up of an earlier Heartbeat compilation of the same name, with one added track (the spiritual ""Tell Them Lord"") and greatly improved sound-- the mastering level on this version towers over the original, and the bass presence is kicked way up to accentuate the rhythmic thrust of the group's early ska sides. Curiosities abound on these discs. From a historical perspective, some of the most interesting tracks are their versions of the spirituals ""Sinner Man"", ""Amen"", ""This Train"", and ""Tell Them Lord""-- impassioned takes on Christian songs that function as interesting precursors of their later embrace of Rastafarianism. Though Bob Marley was the acknowledged leader of the group from the start-- and the only one with previous recording experience-- it's important to note that the group was just called the Wailers, without the ""Bob Marley &"" until around 1970, and that other members sang lead on a large number of their songs. Braithwaite, an original member of the group and the first to leave, was Dodd's favorite voice in the group, and he gets his high tenor out in front of the harmonies on ""Habits"" and ""It Hurts to Be Alone"", the latter featuring an unbelievably gorgeous lead guitar part from Ernest Ranglin. The Wailers' first single, ""Simmer Down"", is one of the defining tracks of the ska era, addressing the violence of the Kingston slums in the patois of the people who lived there. The Skatalites provide the breathtaking rhythm track and horn arrangements, and Kelso, Tosh, Wailer, and Braithwaite harmonize the title under Marley's rough-throated verses. For a one-track recording, there's an impressive amount of detail in the mix, and the song became an instant smash when Dodd played it at his sound system dance the same night it was recorded, quickly moving 70,000 copies. If that doesn't sound like a big number, consider that in the 1960s the total population of Jamaica was less than two million. There are a ton of other great ska cuts spread out across the rest of the set, including a number of excellent rude boy tracks that helped establish the Wailers as spokesmen for the ghetto and the warring gangs of dance crashers who ultimately brought the sound systems to their demise in the late 60s. ""Rude Boy"", which later became the basis for ""Rebel's Hop"", and ""Hooligan"" celebrated rudie attitude, the former featuring lyrics like ""the peego a-go lingua"" (roughly, ""the rude girls are gonna' talk""), that illustrated just how deep the slang of the ghettos could get. The group's initial phase closed with ""Jailhouse"", one of countless Jamaican singles of the period that extolled the fearlessness of the rude boys when confronted by the authorities-- the song also shows them transitioning to the slower rocksteady beat that formed the bridge from ska to reggae. In 1966, Bob Marley went to Delaware to earn money for a planned Wailers label, and Bunny and Peter recruited Constantine Walker to fill his place, recording numerous Wailers sides while Bob was gone. Marley's elevation to iconic status overshadowed Bunny and Peter's estimable solo output, and the Bob-less tracks here show that either one would have been capable of leading the group. The two share lead vocals on the stunning rocksteady tracks ""Who Feels it Knows it"" and ""When the Well Runs Dry"". The harmonies are noticeably sweeter in the absence of Marley, and ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" vies with Alton Ellis's ""Why Birds Follow Spring"" and the Paragons' ""On the Beach"" for the prettiest rocksteady song I've heard. One other remarkable thing about this compilation is the sheer number of songs that don't feature the distinctive Jamaican off-beat accent. Right into 1966, the Wailers regularly recorded straight r&b; and rock'n'roll tracks, and though their version of the Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" (previously unreleased) leaves much to be desired, a number of these songs are fantastic, especially Tosh's Nuggety ""Can't You See"" and the band's outright jaw-dropping version of Dion's ""Teenager in Love"". Indeed, the Wailers continued to record non-reggae songs all the way through their 1970 Island debut Soul Rebels, which features a couple of fantastic funk cuts. All these curiosities add up to very solid set, but all of the alternate takes and rarities make it one that's decidedly for fans-- of Marley and early reggae alike. For newcomers, it might be best to start with Marley's 70s material (it's more of a kick to hear the title track of this comp if you already know the version on Legend and Exodus, not to mention U2's ""One"") and work your way to this set via the Skatalites and some Studio One compilations. If you dig that stuff, One Love at Studio One will likely make you very happy.","2xCD collection gathers 40 Wailers ska tracks recorded between 1963 and 1966 for Clement Dodd's incomparable Studio One label.

Sunset Rubdown EP,Sunset Rubdown,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b0b1335d7bf1698ea9/1:1/w_160/15a14f86.gif,2006-02-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7817-sunset-rubdown-ep/,Global Symphonic,"More than a side project or vanity excursion, Sunset Rubdown offers Wolf Parade co-frontman Spencer Krug the opportunity to air his uncorked ambitions and compositional eccentricities. To my ears, the tracks he wrote and sang on Wolf Parade's Apologies to the Queen Mary-- ""I'll Believe in Anything, You'll Believe in Anything"", ""Grounds for Divorce"", ""Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts""-- are the album's emotionally soaring, crushed-velvet best. However, like his longtime pal and occasional bandmate, Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer, Krug's raw, claustrophobically cracked vocal style can be a dealbreaker, and as such, some shunned Sunset Rubdown's lo-fi debut, Snake's Got a Leg, upon its release last year. I'm sort of addicted to Krug's manic vocal tendencies and off-kilter rhythmic patterns, though-- I'd listen to the guy sing karaoke all night. Minimizing the echo and cleaning up the production, Sunset Rubdown's self-titled EP continues where Snake's closed. The five songs here are firmly grounded; there's no GBV-style ""Hey You Handsome Vulture"" snippet or toy-box fuzz like on ""Snake's Got a Leg II"". Still, each piece is stuffed to the resonating brim. Krug seems to be a fan of windswept, melancholic keyboard lurches, and oddly, of recycling his own catalogue. For instance, before the definitive version of ""I'll Believe in Anything"" was released on Queen Mary, it appeared on Snake's Got a Leg. Similarly, this five-song set includes ""Three Colours"" and ""Three Colours II"", in addition to two takes on ""A Day in the Graveyard"". The rehashing works to create pretty resonances-- it's as though he could spend an entire career reframing the same few songs ad infinitum, and continually expose newer and more elegant angles. Fittingly, the EP opens with guitar repetitions redolent of Sunset Rubdown's earlier take on ""I'll Believe in Anything"". On ""Three Colors"", though, a slightly ominous Krug asks, ""Do you believe that you belong to someone?/ I can't believe that I belong to no one."" His queries are backed by psychedelic organ ministrations (often shadowed by guitar), droning vocal harmonies (a choir of Spencers, if you will), and a slight flange. This thread is picked-up by the final, flanged track, ""Three Colors II"", which goes for the manic Frog Eyes treatment and spirals into repetition of the line, ""You should hear the wind at my window."" Belief is also the subject of ""Jason Believe Me, You Can't Trust Your Dreams"". I have yet to put my finger on specifics, but the tinny organ reminds me of Bach on harpsichord. Singing about femurs and skulls and encouraging someone to ""sleep with your eyes open,"" Krug's vocals are doubled up, and the atmosphere is punctuated with lilting, but downcast whistles. The highlight of the EP is the combination of ""A Day in the Graveyard"" and ""A Day in the Graveyard II"". The first is a sort of sunny throwaway instrumental with gently pretty arpeggios, tap dancing claps, loose fur snare, and tambourine-- the way it builds into part deux is rather glorious, seemingly expanding the latter's reach. After a brief ascension, that ""gentle arpeggio"" hook comes back as a steel drum sound. We get some words this time, too: a ""rose pedal bed,"" ""sun on my shoes,"" and the sinking feeling that ""if you could make another one of you/ Then you wouldn't give the other one to me."" It's really beautiful. Another full-length from Sunset Rubdown is set for release in May. For that effort, Klug manages to keep things quiet and spacious, despite showing up with a bona fide band. If he continues to increase the fidelity and go the ""November Rain"" route, I may have to take a flight to Montreal and crack the recording equipment. But okay, that's jumping the gun. These days, he's still tinkering in his basement and creating moonstruck pop songs that emit the feel of a boat slowly sinking; Krug glug-glugging his Hunky Dory loveliness from a tiny radio and going down with the ship.","Latest EP from the raw, claustrophobic side project of Wolf Parade's Spencer Krug is a teaser for the forthcoming full-length, Shut Up I Am Dreaming.

EP C / B EP,Battles,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10413d197565213851a/1:1/w_160/b04340fc.gif,2006-02-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11695-ep-cb-ep/,Warp,"There are few bands I'm more willing to give the benefit of the doubt than Battles. Luckily, I don't have to-- at least not yet. While the world patiently awaits a proper Battles full-length, the newly released EP C / B EP, their new UK-only double-disc debut for Warp Records, offers no new material at all. Instead, it compiles two of the band's previous EPs, proving the only thing stronger than their power to obliterate is their will to beguile: My copy's labels were switched, so C became B, and vice versa. Not that titles help contextualize things much-- most of them are acronyms like ""SZ2"" and ""Tras 3"" and ""Bttls"". For those of you wondering where A went, though, Battles have so far worked backward from C (as in cryptic), presumably saving the scarlet letter for their next Warp release. So why do they have my confidence? Because Battles are tough without being confrontational, innovative without recourse to bells and whistles, and completely transparent in process. When they're good, they're great; when they're anything less than good, they're so thrillingly alien it doesn't matter. This compiled material basically amounts to a black hole: 66 minutes of the most hypnotic instrumental music currently being purveyed outside techno or Japan. But whereas semi-analogous Sunn O))) and Boris administer hypnotic assaults through deep immersion in drones and brutal low-end, Battles bring the fury with rigorous, unrelenting grooves. ""Tras2"" hits its stride at the halfway mark, before its odd-metered drum loop starts to decay: Drummer John Stainer gradually drops pieces of the beat until there's nothing left but jerky, decontextualized snare/bass unisons. ""Hi/Lo"" is a lurching upbeat stomp that leaves gaping-wide chasms for keyboards to fill with carnival pinwheels. Many Battles songs ask the same question: Can challenging, flex-your-brain-muscles music be harsh, bombastic and unsubtle as well? ""SZ2""'s proposed solution calls on prog-rock chop-worship, attacking nerve centers by force of sheer volume. Check how the guitars keep three polyrhythms airborne while Stainer beats like an ogre beneath, insisting his 2/4 backbeat take primacy. ""B + T"", meanwhile, pivots around linear guitar/bass/drums interplay, each member handling a complex figure but never stepping forward for more than a brief flare. So many notes, yet Battles play each like a one-time shot-- a thousand winning swings at the carnival Test-O-Strength. They never flub. End of story. The long, inchoate noise pieces that occasionally crop up here aren't meant as palate-cleansers but can serve that purpose if you insist. B, truth be told, comes padded like a rubber room-- the hushed, found-sound-sounding ""Bttls"" writhes like a tree full of electronic crickets for nearly half the EP's length (not counting ""Tras"", a carryover from the band's Tras, Fantasy single). Night-and-day comparisons become inevitable once ""Dance"" breaks the silence, its blippy, scat-like organ lines pushed by a hurried beat. Only eight-minute ""Fantasy""-- basically a SETI-watcher's idea of a drum circle-- seems extraneous. Of course, most of us are happy enough just rocking out, cocks optional. When the kids truly bring it, you hear about them, be they adderall-popping mall-punk naifs or tech-metal swordsmiths. But Battles start where most are content to finish; a well-toned muscular sound is their bedrock, their means to an end. Who knows where they'll take it next? Surprise has so far been their only guarantee.","Warp reissues the first two EPs from its latest guitar-based signees, which features Don Caballero's Ian Williams, Tyondai Braxton, Helmet drummer John Stanier, and David Konopka of Lynx.

Inside In/Inside Out,The Kooks,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc50abf31b7dc7155cb9/1:1/w_160/c5cc2a18.jpg,2006-02-22 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4605-inside-ininside-out/,Virgin,"The recent influx of British bands who proudly brandish their regional accents has yet to yield a truly U.S.-conquering icon. Maxïmo Bloc Heads may set Pitchfork-scribe hearts a-flutter, but they're still as unlikely to play in Peoria as the late-60s Kinks, let alone Morrissey or Pulp. The statesiders who'd most appreciate the emo underpinning Arctic Monkeys' precocious tales of bars and bouncers can't even drink legally. And Art Brut, they're still import-only. The Kooks take elements from their up-and-coming peers and a name from Hunky Dory, achieving an adolescent universality that's at once their strongest pitch and greatest failing. The Brighton-based quartet fill their debut Inside In/Inside Out with almost enough exuberant choruses to make up for their more generic failings. Standout ""See the World"" and first single ""Eddie's Gun"" bristle with the straightforward dynamism of I Should Coco-era Supergrass. Follow-up ""Sofa Song"" mugs Strokes skuzz for an attempted hookup. Even as mellower tracks like ""Ooh La"" or ""Naive"" find an uncomfortable meeting point between the Verve and Eagle Eye Cherry, their singalong hooks are hard to hate. The acoustic pop of ""Jackie Big Tits"" is far more charming than its title suggests. ""You only go around, round, round,"" sings Luke Pritchard, his Casablancas-choked, thickly accented melodies translating thanks to sharp melodies and common themes. Ah, but common also has a pejorative sense. Fast and furious third single ""You Don't Love Me"" lacks its predecessors' catchiness, while the shimmying verses of ""Ooh La"" resort to faceless bromides: ""It's a hard life to live/ So live it well"". It's unclear why opener ""Seaside"" is acoustic and drumless, aside from youthful overconfidence; ""I'm just trying to love you,"" Pritchard complains. His oft-repeated thoughts on romance don't get much more novel on the band's sojourns into the umpteenth-wave ska also practiced occasionally by the Arctics and fellow Brits the Paddingtons, such as the stuttering ""Match Box"" or awkwardly political ""If Only"". The Kooks' keen grasp of the banal isn't the only factor keeping them from a distinct personality. Between bouncy Britpop, angst-ridden acoustic anthems, red-light skanking, ""Hounds of Love"" oh-oh harmonies, and the Delta blues intro to ""Time Awaits"", it's not clear the Kooks know who they want to be when they grow up yet, either. Weaker atmospheric tracks like ""I Want You Back"" and the closing ""Got No Love"" suggest the Kooks are best when they're focused instead on brash, catchy, preferably witty pop. True, the provincial focus of a band like Arctic Monkeys may make their songs difficult exports. By contrast, though, being universal doesn't have to mean being impersonal.","Debut from the well-selling UK buzzsaw guitar band is stylistically a close cousin to the work of the Arctic Monkeys.

Future Women,The M's,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37869fc7814a47cd659/1:1/w_160/3264ac45.jpg,2006-02-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5677-future-women/,Polyvinyl,"It may come as a surprise that the M's released their sophomore record in February. Like most winter weekends, though especially this last weekend, the weather in the band's Chicago hometown is cold and unforgiving. It's the time of year when you smile a little less, skip the gym once too often, and stay home cuddling up with your televison more than what's healthy. The M's eponymous debut EP and following full-length were earnest, melodic reclamations of vintage David Bowie and T. Rex, eminently hummable and easy-to-swallow. Both were just a bit timid, however, as if the band was stepping in the footprints of their heroes in the snow, keeping their feet dry. Future Women, on the other hand, is a truck with chains on the tires and a plow on the bumper. It's a dense, ambitious record that finally has the confidence needed to pull of the swagger they've been approximating. Opener ""Plan of the Man"" gives you a feeling for what's in front of you-- layered guitars, rich harmonies, a dash of horns at the end-- but it barely hints at the quality of the rest of the album. ""Trucker Speed"" is the hook to bring you in, where the band uses every trick in their arsenal. Strings bring suspense to the song's finale, while far-off horns punctuate guitars that lap the sides of the groove like big waves on a small boat. Really, it's really drummer Steve Warsaw working overtime here: Witness a cowbell that sounds like it's actually dangling from a cow's neck, and then the pounding that precedes the song's second half. It starts as a tractor chase, but it soon becomes a high-speed pursuit under the city's elevated train. Elsewhere, ""Shawnee Dupree"" waves its threatening low-end behind its back while the boys make polite come-ons in three-part harmony, and ""Going Over It"" adds church bells to the corners of its molasses guitar crunch, somehow making it all the more ominous. A well-placed ballad (""Light I Love"") clears the pallette for the hyper-melodic ""My Gun"", where the high notes of a xylophone skitter across the ever-present grinding of the guitars. More familiar pleasures follow, like the swaying title track, the horn-laden rave-up ""Mansion of the Valley"", and the starry-eyed closer ""Darling Lucia"". It's well-tread ground the M's are bounding across; you'll hear far-too-familiar barrel-roll piano on ""Never Do This Again"", and you can see in your head the pained faces the guitarist is making for some of these licks, on the second return of ""My Gun"" and elswehere. But the issue isn't dodging cliché, it's how well you can swing it. The M's have found a canny chemistry out of seemingly simple parts (three-part harmonies plus a powerhouse drummer), and now, they've got swagger to spare.","Second album from Chicago's charming, Polyvinyl-signed glam-pop revivalists.

Tacoma Mockingbird,Eliot Lipp,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf7ea9e61561daa7805/1:1/w_160/fe2c9515.jpg,2006-02-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5002-tacoma-mockingbird/,Hefty,"The most technically adept instrumental hip-hop can still be boring when it loses its focus in a wash of pretty textures and fractured beats that drift by anonymously. Even big guns like Dabrye-- an obvious Eliot Lipp influence-- are sometimes guilty of misplacing their best ideas in the intricate digital corridors of their plentiful gear. Lipp's fluid electro bypasses this pratfall by using a minimal set-up-- mainly a sampler and a vintage Sequential Circuits keyboard-- to create focused, song-oriented bangers leavened with crisp, kinetic shifts. His music is sheer California, blending the Bay Area's cerebral undie-hop into the breezy, whistling G-funk of Cali's mainstream 1990s heyday. As I cast about for a valid critical approach to Lipp's sophomore LP, two distinct vectors present themselves, and the one you favor will determine your overall enjoyment of the album. The first is purely technical. Tacoma Mockingbird's rhythmic infrastructure is clean, sharp, and eye-poppingly obvious-- Lipp has publicly stated that he's interested in breathing new life into some of the most overused breaks of all time. As if to drive the point home, he barely alters these famous breaks, usually opting to let them establish rigid skylines under the lurid sunsets of his keyboards. Even if you're bad at recognizing familiar elements when they occur in new contexts, Lipp's beats will be instantly familiar: The creeping skitter of ""Tic Tac""; the elementary snares of ""Times Four""; the syncopated pulse of ""Mashin' on 'Em"". This directness may scan as a cop-out to those of you who actually make beats, which, given the relative affordability and popularity of the technology today, is a significant contingent. Rockist equivalent: One person's hot guitar solo is another's trite reiteration of descending minor scales. The second approach to Tacoma Mockingbird is aesthetic. This approach is most likely to find purchase with listeners who aren't seriously involved in beat-making, and in light of the rating above, it should be clear which one I favor. The question is whether artists should make music for other musicians or for fans, and while the former can produce results that captivate both sides of the technically-savvy axis, the latter often wins out with the layperson by prioritizing listenability over complexity. Limitations can be artistically fruitful-- it's more difficult to write a fresh-seeming sonnet than to create an open form-- and Lipp's elementary breaks help him to focus the thermodynamic energy of his music, imbuing it with an aura of classic familiarity. Just look at what happens in these songs, the heirs apparent to Ratatat's accessible blend of hip-hop, rock dynamics and electro-- the vibrant colors that saturate the keys; the intricately braided strands of glossy melody and thick bass buzz that inexorably surge and glide; the nonstop onslaught of memorable hooks whipping precisely around hairpin curves. From the seasick casino-boat stutter of ""Glasspipe"" to the wind-rippled, neon-reflecting puddles of ""Rap Tight"" to the languid squelch of ""Check Weight"", Lipp proves that sometimes, buying shiny new rims is a better approach to reinventing old wheels than tampering with the harmony of form and function inherent in their annularity.","Fliud, technically adept instrumental hip-hop from Hefty.

Everything Wrong Is Imaginary,Lilys,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd18ea9e61561daa762e/1:1/w_160/4f0ee35c.jpg,2006-02-22 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4799-everything-wrong-is-imaginary/,Mainfesto,"In the 15 years since their first single, Kurt Heasley and his rotating band of shapeshifters have been called many things: shoegaze, dream-pop, Kinks klones. The Philadelphia-based Lilys have usually separated their genre leaps by album, with 1992 debut In the Presence of Nothing a fine testament to Lovelessness, 1995's Eccsame the Photon Band a hallucinatory revelation, and relatively more recent work, particularly 1999's The 3-Way, diverging into crunchy '60s British Invasion revivalism. Finally, on Everything Wrong Is Imaginary, Lilys' various iterations coalesce convincingly into a psychedelic quirk-pop summary. If shoegaze is about to become the new garage, as Playboy recently predicted (duh, the articles), Lilys may also finally be timely. Don't get me wrong: Their latest isn't as cochlea-crushing or easily labeled as songs like ""Collider"" and aptly titled ""Tone Bender"" from the band's first full-length, which hit just as Britpop and grunge were dislodging the original shoegaze movement. But the biggest differences longtime listeners will notice from 2003's indistinct comeback album Precollection are the intermittent detonations of vibrato-afflicted volume. On opener ""Black Carpet Magic"", wavy guitar noise sears almost distractingly through bright Pernice Brothers melodies and Grandaddy-ish electronic sun-splashes. Swoony, layered ""Knocked on the Fortune Teller's Door"" leans hard against the whammy bar and reveals the album's M.O.: ""I heard your words,"" Heasley whispers through clouds of feedback and flute-light vocal effects-- then thinks better of it-- ""Of course not: your voice."" It's a subtle testament to sound on album that both reaches sky-tingling sonic heights and scratches occasional gummy shoe-bottoms in its attention to subtleties. Again, though, this isn't your older brother's shoegaze. Far from it. While the best songs aren't as languid as on the band's subsequent Eccsame the Photon Band, they combine the melodicism of that album's ""Day of the Monkey"" with the rhythmic denseness of Precollection, playing the wall-of-head-liquefaction card only sparingly. ""With Candy"" relies on peppy, repetitive hooks, sparkly synths and candy-factory overstimulation to distract from a lovelorn plea of ""Come back, darling."" The instrumental title track borrows scratchy guitars, primitive electronic beats and a bassline one bets would look good on a dance floor. But the song that gradually unlocks the album's more obscure passages is ""The Night Sun Over San Juan"", which despite its Thrills-like title is wistful, edgy pop, with Heasley's high wobble at one point evoking Robert Smith. The album swims in gauzy details, and this track's weird catchiness floats like a life preserver. While much of the record's beauty lies its dizzying production, other songs become submerged, emphasizing all-too-vague mood over articulation. ""Still in All the Glitter"", with its fractured piano and drunken chord changes, almost gets lost in its own veneer. ""Push off who you are/ It's time to go,"" Heasley sings, but the song hangs onto its swaying drone a minute or two too long. So too, ""Where the Night Goes"", with jackhammering beats, indiscernible vocals, and guitars that pound boringly where they should prod. For all that, Everything Wrong Is Imaginary never quite feels like the career-culminating record it should be. ""A Diana's Diana"" bumps to a funky rhythm somewhere between Midnite Vultures and Remain in Light, though it's not quite as fun as either masterpiece. More successful is witty closer ""Scott Free"" (as in ""This is where I get off...""), which clatters with multi-tracked acoustic guitars and murderously fey harmonies like the best of Oh, Inverted World. Either could represent the next incarnation of a band that, in its right turns and (per the album title) its wrong ones, has always brimmed with imagination.","On this comeback album the veteran indie band's iterations coalesce convincingly into a psychedelic quirk-pop summary.

Drum's Not Dead,Liars,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf6eb335119a49ecd99/1:1/w_160/2d68c9d8.jpg,2006-02-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/,Mute,"Ditching Berliniamsburg for the real deal, Liars moved to Germany in late 2004 to replant their roots in fresh cultural soil and begin recording their third album in a studio that offered creative possibilities too fertile to resist: The acoustically rich radio facility in the former East Germany boasts a labyrinthine system of rooms, each with its own distinct acoustic advantages. The trio's relocation is sure to be cited as the impetus for the Krautrock-like propulsivity of the resulting LP, but prior to the change of scenery they were exploring this kind of dark percussiveness on 2004's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned. Most listeners had shrugged that album off for its dissimilarity to the band's acclaimed dance-punk debut, They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, but while hectic, less refined, and at times sloppy, the underrated They Were Wrong marked the shift in direction that would lead Liars to the ethereal gorgeousness of Drum's Not Dead. Highlighted by taut improvisation and frontman Angus Andrew's mastery of falsetto, the record's resolute seamlessness may be attributable to growth through practice: Liars wrote and recorded one album, but, not wholly satisfied with the results, decided against releasing it. Instead, that material was used as a blueprint for what became Drum's Not Dead, and in the process, the band cast off They Were Wrong's witches and Walpurgisnacht. Granted, there is still a conceptual libretto, this time centered on the universal struggle between confidence and cowardice. These traits are represented by two characters: the instinctive and assertive Drum, and the pessimistic, apprehensive Mt. Heart Attack. Of course, as with They Were Wrong, any conceptual devices remain secondary to the sound and mood. ""Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!"" perfectly sets the stage, as fractured guitar waves, opiate military percussion, and Andrew's windswept vocals careen into pitch-shifts which slightly deepen the shadows. Segueing into ""Let's Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack"", Liars let forth a siren call that bears an uncanny resemblance to the first few seconds of Faust's ""The Sad Skinhead"", then plunge into bubbling floor-tom/cymbal madness that echoes both Liquid Liquid and This Heat. The percussion is corporeal, tapping into some inner biological timepiece, and as on the album's best tracks, guitar notes are employed only as simple pulsing behind layered, seraphic vocals. Completing the mood-setting opening triad, ""A Visit From Drum"" is linked again by a vocal gasp; a less treated kit accompanies a floor tom/snare and the clattering of sticks for a creepy, mystic sounding incantation. Here and elsewhere, the guitar is an ambient sidekick to high-pitched vocals and tribal drumming. Those first three songs are the album's strongest grouping, yet the excellent push/pull sequencing of Drum's Not Dead creates a shivery cumulative effect that spans the entire length of the record: By its closing notes, you're likely to find yourself awed and emotionally spent. ""Drum Gets a Glimpse"" pairs a mournful Eno-esque melodic sense with cymbal washes, M83 guitar tones, crickets, and Andrew trading lines between the naive and melancholy falsetto of Mt. Heart Attack (""It seems like all our friends have gone""), and the deeper, more authoritative Drum (""You drove them out""). Later, there are a couple of abstract pieces-- fuzzier, looping canyon bliss-outs with left-channel acoustic guitar; a bit of swirling, Sister-era Sonic Youth shredding-- along with a pair of standouts. The first of these, ""Drum and the Uncomfortable Can"", is coated in reverb that amplifies the intensity of the cannibalistic double drumming: It's primal marching band music wrapped in guitar feedback and a howling voice singing about hiding a body. The second comes with the straightforward, closing ballad ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"", which resolves the album at its-- and the band's-- absolute peak. Like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps"", its surprise sentimentality lends essential emotional weight, but does so with a dedicated restraint. Gentle guitar drifts accrue density alongside sighing vocals, warmed tom tom heartbeats, tiny instrumental accents (piano, tambourine, roughed-up strings), and Andrew's simple, sweet sentiments: ""I won't run far, I can always be found""; ""If you want me to stay, I will stay by your side."" For added value, Liars flesh things out with an accompanying DVD that presents three visual versions of the album: ""Drum's Not Bread"" by drummer Julian Gross, ""The Helix Aspersa"" by Andrew, and filmmaker Markus Wambsganss' ""By Your Side"". Due to its liberal use of live and studio footage (and farm animals, actually), Gross' best held my attention. More refined, Wambsganss creates effects with light and motion-- his three-channel video for ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"" is his portion's most compelling moment. Maintaining a stoic minimalism, Andrew fixates on a snail's ponderous adventures through Germany. Of course, the music remains the greatest draw. Those who previously yearned for a career trajectory the band wisely ditched ought to listen to Drum and keep track of the epiphanies. In the coming weeks, its strengths will win converts, even among those who'd previously jumped ship. But my favorite detail of this feel-good story-- popular Brooklyn post-punk band falls out of favor by changing directions and ultimately produces an album that eclipses its debut-- is that Liars are still waltzing along on their own terms. This, their third LP, shows zero concessions to the criticisms they received from publications like Spin and Rolling Stone, who awarded They Were Wrong their lowest possible marks. Succeeding rather than regressing or retreating, Liars have had the last laugh: Drum's Not Dead is a majestic victory lap, and on all levels, a total fucking triumph. ","Two years after 2004's They Were Wrong So We Drowned turned dance-punk's brightest trio into impressionistic noise-rockers, Liars return with an even bigger surprise: Drum's Not Dead actually tops their groundbreaking, beat-heavy debut through an evolution of the sound that turned much of their fanbase against them.

Now Playing,Ayatollah,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ddea9e61561daa48d3/1:1/w_160/5acaab5c.jpg,2006-02-21 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/501-now-playing/,Nature Sounds,"Hey, who took all the rapping off this album? Without the bark and personality of an MC to elevate or mangle his music, it'd be rather simple for an album as quiet and unassuming as Ayatollah's Now Playing to fall away into the ether. Created without fuss, the longtime Queens-based hip-hop producer's official instrumental debut (the underground hit So Many Reasons To Rhyme was never officially released) is an efficient album full of downbeat, soul-laced songs. But it's certainly a curio from an accomplished, if too sporadically working musician. Ayatollah's best-known work-- ""Mos Def's ""Ms Fat Booty"", Styles P and Pharoahe Monch's Soundbombing collaboration ""The Life""-- would fit well here. But that begs the question: Why didn't dude just sell some of these beats? The music would work as a backdrop, but there isn't a clearly defined theme to this competent if tangential set of songs. The reason lacks rhyme, I guess. Many of the songs seem to be designed specifically for vocal accompaniment. The elegiac ""Hold U"" (originally from Masta Ace's Disposable Arts) glides a bit oddly into the ragga-tinged ""Kingston"". The whistle-n-moan ""Devil is Sweet"" would work for any number of Rawkus'd exiles (Kweli comes to mind) or as the requisite end-of-album, somber track for a maje label second-tier soliloquist like Lloyd Banks. Instead it just juts out-- a fine, uncomplicated record in a sea of them. ""This Song Is Over"" samples the same track from Who's Next (not sure how he cleared that sample) and sullenly summarizes much of the album's mood. Ayatollah has his somnabulic bounce down cold: mix two parts well-chopped soul loop with one part breakbeat; add synth for ominous juxtaposition. This is not to diminish the tact it takes to craft something like this, something that cleverly leaves gaps for the chorus and drops snares out for big punchline punches. But Now Playing works in opposition to contemporaries like Rjd2's Deadringer or Blockhead's Downtown Science or even Dilla's recent Donuts, which traded hooks for beat schizophrenia. Those guys embraced the spotlight, for better or worse, in the absence of someone shouting over their track. Ayatollah, perhaps with the exception of the rim-rocking ""Go For It"", is cool with hanging in the background, even when he's right up front.","Longtime Queens-based hip-hop producer's official debut is an efficient album full of downbeat, soul-laced instrumentals.

Fantastic Success,Measles Mumps Rubella,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c379ea9e61561daa7f18/1:1/w_160/351ee917.jpg,2006-02-21 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5678-fantastic-success/,Doubling Cube,"""You had a plan for your band, but you didn't tell your band, now you're out of the band,"" mocked Brendan Fowler, aka BARR, on his recent debut album, Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case. Turns out he was actually singing about former Measles Mumps Rubella vocalist Brett Patrick Lyman, who parted ways with the group following disputes about which direction to focus their sound and ambition. New vocalist Chuck Bettis who, like the band's other three members, moved to New York from Washington, D.C., fronted outfits such as the Metamatics, Trance and the Arcade, and All Scars. Bettis's clipped bark-- flickering effortlessly between the frenetic beats and driving sizzle of keyboards-- sounds like a natural addition to the group's ambitious soundscapes, which have become lengthier and more expansive since their last release, Fountain Of Youth (Troubleman). At times echoing their former label mates Erase Errata, Measles Mumps Rubella flourish in the prickly, disjointed space between instruments, while encouraging fluid patterns to emerge organically from this tension. One of the best examples is on ""Hollow Bodies"" when an oscillating keyboard rhythm drops down to spar with an anxious, relentlessly fast hi-hat drumbeat. Bettis' vocals also have their own rhythmic quality, and the effective interlock of lyrics and breathless panting and hissing on the album's opening track, ""Algorithm Of Desire"", creates a dovetailing mayhem of fricative cadences gradually smothered by delay and pools of itchy fuzz. Although it would be possible to square off Measles Mumps Rubella as another New York dance-punk band snapping at the heels of !!! and Out Hud, there is a dark and almost psychedelic undercurrent to the group's momentum that steers them away from becoming too imitative of that style. Fantastic Success is colored by a compelling energy and determination, and this is where the record's strongest qualities lie. One suspects that Measles Mumps Rubella's relatively slow start in releasing a debut album-- their first 7"" came out four years ago, on their own Malady imprint-- and the hurdles overcome in the process of losing a founding member and having to re-track all of Fantastic Success' original vocal lines with Bettis, has much to do with this. There's an audible need in this music-- a desire to release creative ideas left simmering for practical reasons. For this reason, Fantastic Success gleams with an ardent energy that provides the perfect platform for Measles Mumps Rubella's shadowy, polyrhythmic fury.","First record with new singer Chuck Bettis work well with the group's ambitious soundscapes, which have become lengthier and more expansive.

Drowning in a Sea of Love,Nathan Fake,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929becaeb335119a49ed0fa/1:1/w_160/9f8133a9.jpg,2006-02-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3360-drowning-in-a-sea-of-love/,Border Community,"It wasn't long after he released his first 12-inch on James Holden's fledgling Border Community imprint in 2003 that Norfolk's Nathan Fake was tagged progressive techno's poster boy. His age (a disarming 22), preeminent fondness for gauzy synths, and continued close affiliation with Border Community-- now sort of the Green Party of techno labels-- have reinforced that caricature, but its been his gradual shift away from the sturdy rhythms of early tracks like ""Outhouse"" in favor of the facemelting sounds of ""Dynamo"" and ""The Sky Was Pink"" that have cemented the image. Drowning in a Sea of Love marks Fake's long-awaited debut LP, and sees him complete the transformation from 4/4-friendly house producer into the prog prince of nu-IDM. Where his singles once comprised long, rolling stretches of gravel road rhythms, there's barely a beat to be found here, and what few there are bump less like thunderstorms than metronomes, existing as cursory structures rather than focal points. It's a drastic change, but it's not necessarily for the worse. Texturally, Drowning recalls both M83 and Morr Music's cutesy cadre of melody-happy synthpoppers, but where the former often feels too rich for consumption and the latter too relentlessly sweet, this strikes a perfect note somewhere in between. It's one of the lightest, easiest records I've heard in a long time, a low-calorie pleasure that makes up for what it lacks in gut-level punch by never seeming to diminish in returns. ""Superpositions"", ""You Are Here"", and ""Long Story"" are all shoegazer-inspired tracks that begin as embers and finish as forest fires, and ""Bawsey"" is a beautiful, decaying, minor-key piece that might as well have been swiped right out of Boards Of Canada's textbook, but it's the swoonsome ""Charlie's House"" that stands as the album's highlight. Beginning with a crisp rhythm track and a glowing, circular arpeggio, it takes on a haunting, dusky quality about a minute in, when Fake introduces his favorite sound: the same yawning, mournful synth that made the original incarnation of ""The Sky Was Pink"" (which gets a workmanlike remix elsewhere on the record) such a revelation. Holden's remix of ""The Sky Was Pink"" was one of my favorite techno tracks of last year, if not ever, and his shadow looms large over this record as well. I might just be projecting what I know of the back story onto the material, but despite having formally moved away from house music, it still often feels like Fake is setting the table for-- or at least overtly tempting-- the remix. Maybe that's why early reviews of this have been just as likely to lump it in with house as with IDM, because there's a certain spirit to what Fake does that can't be erased simply because the backbone has been. Regardless, he's got such a beautiful, producer-ly touch that we should be happy with whatever record he wants to make, so long as he's making them.","Debut LP from one of techno's poster boys delivers on the promise of his singles.

"The Exchange Session, Vol. 1",Kieran Hebden,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0deb335119a49ecfe0/1:1/w_160/ce29d8fd.jpg,2006-02-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3170-the-exchange-session-vol-1/,Domino,"Steve Reid began his pop music career as a Motown session drummer, backing Martha Reeves and James Brown in his spare time, but he made his name with ruthless avant-jazz albums in the mid-1970s, compiling the most corrosive elements of Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra. Witness the ferocious Stax-thumped steel of Nova or the midnight funk of Rhythmatism. They're eminently organic records, arranging unkempt percussive bursts into cohesive swarms of soul and noise. It's a bit bizarre then to see the 62-year-old legend collaborate with Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, a high-tech bricoleur of electronic whispers and scratches. The teaming represents one more attempt to fuse physicality and virtuality, nature and machine, chaos and process, and all those other tired dichotomies that electronic artists feel obligated to address. The unconventional partnership began on Steve Reid's superb Spirit Walk, which generated a clutch of formidable live gigs and a two-album series, starting with The Exchange Session, Vol. 1. Sadly, a brief preview on a Gilles Peterson comp (""Knives and Forks"") made the duo seem destined for disappointment, articulating every cliché in innocuous techno-jazz: dull blips, tepid fills, sterilized synthesizers. When it tried to capture a Steve Reich-like blend of jazz and gamelan, the piece seemed unable to gain any traction. The music seemed listless and uneven, as if the union were merely suggested by some perplexed record exec. Impressively, Reid and Hebden occasionally manage to combat these tendencies on their full-length debut. Sure, there are stereotypical motifs in the mix-- chipper birdcalls, brushing effects, tinny turntable maneuvers-- but it also has some remarkably gorgeous passages, brimming with Reid's fuming vitality and Hebden's electronic ingenuity. On ""Morning Prayer"", drums bristle in front of crinkled mounds of funk and shrill pulsations. It's both calm and vaguely menacing. In recent years, Reid has further tempered his improvisations with forays into West African rhythms, and Hebden ably assists by including reverential allusions to daqqa and baayo discord. In the longer pieces, Hebden's competence is severely tested by Reid's subtleties. Patchy digital fades seem either sporadic or restrictive, and the middles tend to muddle or fall into rote repetition. Of course, there are still lengthy moments of inspiration: The synthesized fragments of ""Electricity and Drum"" drain through Reid's cymbals and link with drilled reverb, filtered radio frequencies, static, and swirling fax bleeps. These passages are often elegant but, unfortunately, they make more tedious moments all the more obvious. In general-- and despite passages of extreme beauty-- something seems amiss on Exchange Session. There is neither symmetry nor dissymmetry in the performances, as if both musicians were trying to pass by one another and kept colliding instead. Unlike a true alliance, Hebden and Reid seem to be playing two separate performances simultaneously. Under the right circumstances, this could make for a tense, dramatic recording. Instead, it often feels merely neglectful. If the album is one of Reid's attempts to move jazz forward within an electronic context, it demonstrates neither dazzling innovation nor complete mastery. At the same time, there is enough here to prove that both musicians have been (and are) great innovators within their respective genres. The sum is somehow less than the parts, but the parts are still invaluable.","The first official full-length collaboration between Four Tet and the veteran avant-jazz drummer.

The Proposition OST,Nick Cave and Warren Ellis,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56ab1335d7bf1698bc0/1:1/w_160/ef549f7f.gif,2006-02-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1373-the-proposition-ost/,Mute,"Nick Cave usually writes in the zone between the grandiose and the ridiculous, which can be rewarding in his music but frustrating elsewhere. When the Bad Seeds provide a backdrop against which Cave's tales of woe can play out, the results-- from Tupelo through Abattoir Blues-- are inimitable and so compelling that one can easily forgive their pretensions. But Cave's faux-Faulknerian novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel, strode defiantly into the realm of the ridiculous and there defended itself against such literary niceties as setting, character, credibility, and restraint. The Proposition, the movie based on Cave's screenplay about bushrangers in late 19th century Australia, doesn't open in the U.S. until late spring, so it's understood that reviewers like me have had no chance to determine how the music is used in the film. But the casting is impressive (Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, and Emily Watson) and the story sounds like an intriguing device for exploring his usual themes of betrayal and redemption. Already The Proposition is being heralded as a violent epic, which might suggest that Cave has indulged his every Gothic whim. But exactly where this movie falls between silly and sublime is anyone's guess, at least for a few more months. The soundtrack gives nothing away. Cave co-wrote and performed these tracks with Dirty Three violinist and occasional Bad Seed Warren Ellis, and the music ranges from the intimate to the epic, from the understated to the overblown. Most of the songs are small and so particular that you can almost discern a story from them. ""The Proposition #1"" establishes an ambient background against which Ellis' violin scratches out a ragged melody, evoking some nocturnal conspiracy full of twisted menace. And the shuffling rhythms and windblown percussion of ""Banyon Road"" (title notwithstanding) suggests an arduous journey, while the creeping bassline implies the danger of reaching the destination. Elsewhere, Cave and Ellis set fluttering piano and swirling violin against a flat drone, evoking the wide-openness of the Australian range and the isolation-- emotional as well as geographical-- of the characters who inhabit it. Rumbling noises suggest peril, and blasts of guitar feedback act out sudden violence. Overall, it's a tense listen that suggests a tale full of suspense and blood. That sense of sonic narrative helps the soundtrack stand on its own apart from the movie, but doesn't excuse its indulgences. While Ellis's violin sounds as purposeful here as it did on the Dirty Three's best work-- particularly Horse Stories-- Cave's vocal contributions seem generally superfluous. On songs like ""Down to the Valley"" and ""Clean Hands, Dirty Hands"", he gently sings lyrics that sound like they were made up on the spot, which is odd considering the movie has been gestating for nearly a decade. On ""The Proposition #1"", ""Down to the Valley"", and ""Moan Thing"", he moans plaintively over the music: As a one-off performance, it's fine, but as a motif repeated over songs, it's grating. Featuring Cave's most prominent contributions, four tracks called ""The Rider"" should be the soundtrack's centerpiece, but instead they revel in brash overstatement. Cave sings softly, but still manages to sound overwrought-- the riders, he intends, are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. His lyrics do him no favors either: ""'When?' said the moon to the stars in the sky,"" he sings on ""The Rider #1"". ""'Soon,' said the wind that followed him home. 'Who,' said the crow that started to cry. 'Me,' said the rider as dry as a bone."" Ultimately, in the canon of rock soundtracks to Westerns, The Proposition falls somewhere near the middle. It's easily better than Bon Jovi's contribution to Young Guns II and even rivals Joe Strummer's recently reissued soundtrack for Alex Cox's Walker, but it's not even in the same league as Neil Young's noodly soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, Dylan's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid, or-- the top of the mountain-- Altman's use of Leonard Cohen in McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Still, by making the intimate seem so epic and the quiet so loud, The Proposition soundtrack should at least intrigue listeners enough to see the film.","Bad Seeds leader and his occasional bandmate create music that ranges from the intimate to the epic, from the understated to the overblown, to a film based on Cave's screenplay about bushrangers in late 19th century Australia.

Nomad Junk,Capitol K,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a516b1335d7bf1698aff/1:1/w_160/02e298b0.jpg,2006-02-20 06:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1293-nomad-junk/,Faith and Industry,"For those dismayed by Capitol K's move toward traditional live-band instrumentation on previous album Happy Happy, Kristian Robinson has returned to the sounds and themes of breakthrough LP Island Row and pushed up the dance quotient even further. With titles like ""Hong Kong"", ""Tapei"", and ""Pan Continental"", Nomad Junk is a electronic pastiche of traveling and cultural tourism. Fittingly then, opener ""Jamboree"" feels like a slow ride on a moving walkway into a glamourous foreign airport. Robinson wraps a few thin notes of guitar around a cracking drum loop, the atmosphere thick like humid air, and a climbing acoustic guitar figure unfolds over it all with Zeppelin-esque grace. ""Hong Kong"" breaks a bouzouki riff to pieces over stiff, unforgiving drums and Robinson's sound effect library: shooting lasers, ringing telephones, and far-off flute whistles. The pan-global restlessness is underlined by ""Can't Lie Down"". One of Nomad Junk's few non-instrumental tracks, Robinson takes a fanciful vocal turn over single strums of guitar and happily bubbling synth tones. Playfully speak-singing on one line, mumbling on the next, it aptly turns distraction and noncomittance into playful pop. Heavy vocoder on the brooding ""Taipei"" pushes the album further onto the dancefloor. Momentum is lost in the second half, and the mariachi guitars in ""Pan-continental"" are a bit too obvious signifiers for the title's suggestion. While the album is well-paced and transitions smoothly from track-to-track, it all sounds somewhat dated. I assumed that came with the return-to-form territory, and Capitol K had to risk irrelevance to return to his roots (or at least his best material). But no; breaking out Island Row again, it still sounds fresh, tearing apart rhythms and slathering distortion on fearlessly. It's Nomad Junk that plays it safe. It treads the same territory as Island Row, but even its best tracks are a tourist's surface glance instead of a new insight.","After a move toward live-band instrumentation, Kristian Robinson returns to the sounds and themes of his breakthrough LP, Island Row.

Up Above,Town and Country,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ee13d1975652139538/1:1/w_160/f364fdaa.jpg,2006-02-20 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8124-up-above/,Thrill Jockey,"In 2004, the Chicago-based quartet Town and Country toured and performed with minimalist pioneer Tony Conrad, an association that by all appearances seems to have provided the long-running group with a proper dosage of both validation and inspiration. Though Conrad himself doesn't appear on Town and Country's sixth album Up Above, his creative influence is felt acutely throughout, as the group deliver what is by far their most vigorous and diverse collection to date. Rigged with an assortment of obscure folk instruments (Japanese shakuhachi, Moroccan guimbri, Chinese khaen) and with a newfound emphasis on vocals and percussion, Town and Country here perform within an expansive, pan-ethnic cosmology that's been barely hinted at on their earlier albums, managing a surprising number of ecstatic peaks along the journey. On previous releases like 2003's 5, Town and Country's minimal, real-time excursions could terminate in pieces so static that they often appeared inert and featureless, like helium-filled aircraft lacking the sturdy framework necessary to transport passengers. Here the group's directional shift is immediately evident on the opening ""Sun Trolley"". Following a brief fanfare of chimes and droning reeds, the piece nods respectfully to Conrad with an abrupt solo of saw-toothed viola before again shifting into an homespun gamelan maze of mouth harp, sitar, and hand percussion. It's an introduction that may come as a small revelation for those familiar with the glacial, soporific modulations of Town and Country's past work, but even so does little to prepare the listener for the vibrancy of Up Above's multi-hued performances. Primarily recorded during summer 2005 in group member James Dorling's Chicago apartment, the album nevertheless captures the open space of some distant Silk Road tributary. On tracks like ""Phoney Fuckin Mountain"" or ""Fields and Parks of Easy Access"", Town and Country recall some of the casual East/West unions of Popul Vuh's Hosianna Mantra. Elsewhere, the percussive likes of ""Cloud Seeding"" or the plucked strings of ""Bee Call"" can so resemble composer Tan Dun's film scores that you'll be on the lookout for shadowy martial warriors leaping across the rooftops. Conrad's influence is felt again on ""King of Portugal"", a dense improvised psych-drone based upon a traditional Portuguese Christmas carol, with Dorling's semi-wordless vocal providing additional cryptic overtones. The set culminates with the nine-minute title track, a volcanic free-form ritual that scatters the album's many gilded threads to the four winds, along with all thoughts of placid minimalism. As with the rest of Up Above, this trance-inducing mini-epic is remarkable for its variant textures and periodic bursts of dissonance, neither of which have figured much in Town and Country's past work. As such, the album does rather muddle the group's ongoing identity, but hopefully future releases can serve to confirm this album as the watershed it now appears to be.","Thrill Jockey band gets assistance from Tony Conrad on its sixth album, the group's most vigorous and diverse collection to date.

Plague Dogs,Heros Severum,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c192eb335119a49ed59c/1:1/w_160/0bd7a5eb.jpg,2006-02-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4034-plague-dogs/,Two Sheds Music,"My first, promising reaction: What a weird band. They come at you with blustery post-punk and easygoing Peach State twang all at once, one vocalist (Eric Friar) coughing clenched half-syllables, the other (Sheryl Branch) honoring the homeland in silken diphthongs. Percussive clatter, wormy synths, shrill interlocking guitars, and sax skronk play musical chairs around lots of really interesting melodies. Clearly this trio has studied its Jawbox and Burning Airlines LPs, taken additional cues from Smart Went Crazy, the Dismemberment Plan, Les Savy Fav, and Giddy Motors, and simplified those sources to a basic linear geometry. The Athens thing is a red herring: Except a brief spate of ethereal vocal harmonics on ""A Nice Haircut"" and some of Branch's backup singing, nothing here bespeaks a psychedelic indolence. Plague Dogs reaches even further back into the 90s for its frissons. What, because we're into the second half of this decade bands can start cribbing from the second half of the last? If they do it as confidently, creatively, and playfully as Heros Severum, I say let 'em go nuts. Plague Dogs weatherstrips sorta-obscure vestiges of late 90's indie rock, reminding us of when syncopation was cool and J. Robbins recorded every fourth album. Whereas Robbins' projects tended to spotlight thick, sludgy/funky bass, Heros Severum do without the instrument altogether. When your drummer's as good as Davey Staton, having a pared-down (read: one man) rhythm section is emancipating, like Little Timmy losing his training wheels. Staton performs many tricks, including limber open stroke rolls (""3kh2"") and dizzying tom-kick whirligigs (""And Introducing""). Guitars prove their chops by keeping up, weaving polyrhythmic formworks. Near-constant vocals give direction to the cosmology, but some songs satisfy a wanderlust through hypnotic call-and-response vamps. In other words, Heros Severum are the kind of band that could list ""jam band"" on Myspace for larfs and wouldn't be lying entirely. Dare you to call their bluff, but the could-be-joking bits function as well as humor-- even when they essay smarmy rap slang. ""And Introducing..."" first practices less-is-more around the vocal, drawing focus to Branch's jive talk (""Got a chicken neck, coke bottle, broken back spine/ Better watch it, man, 'fore I whoop your behind""), then, as if to contraindicate such use of singsongy hip-hop affect, the band let rip on some intricate kicks, words ousted by floating vowel sounds. Friar's lyrics are uniformly terse and nonsensical; he sings like he lacks the breath for more than one or two syllables at a time. The style enables him to issue galvanizing rally cries, which sound more meaningful than they probably are. On ""Sick Dog"", at what may be the album's apogee, he screams fearlessly, ""Can't keep a brother down,"" over molten sax blurt. ""A Nice Haircut"" asks, ""Were ya raised proper?"" (like this is a band to talk!), then schools in skeletal groove, tamped down tight and shot from Gang of Four's stiff-is-the-new-loose bazooka. Heros Severum are obviously not the first to use levity as a foil against what's at heart complex and quite measured songwriting, but they've made it the crux of a surprisingly fresh record.","Promising indie rock band comes at you with blustery post-rock and easygoing Peach State twang all at once.

Catch That Totem! (1998-2005),Alog,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b013d19756521386b8/1:1/w_160/04e8e080.gif,2006-02-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/462-catch-that-totem-1998-2005/,Melektronikk,"You'd expect two guys as in love with sound as Norway's Espen Sommer Eide and Dag-Are Haugan to have a lot of tapes lying around. For this late 2005 release, the two men of Alog were asked by the Oslo-based Melektronikk to assemble the best of their odds and ends. The result is this 13-track collection, which, though not exactly new, have been heard by almost nobody. Included are a couple of previously released remixes and scattered bits from small-run EPs and singles, but they're probably new to you unless you're reading this from Tromsø. That a skim of the archive can produce such an interesting record says a lot about the value of the Alog project. It's all over the place, and it shouldn't hang together, and yet it does. Alog called their terrific 2005 album Miniatures, but the title would have been more apt for this release. Ten of these selections are under five minutes; such restraint is a rarity in the world of abstract electronics, but it works wonders when dealing with this level of variety. Each track is a small world unto its own, with a unique palette and structure. Alog get in, lay out the rules, make their statement, and get out, wasting not a note and leaving you wanting more. The highlights rank with their best work, and, in one case, with anything I've heard in a long while. The treasure for me is ""Song Sung Inwardly"", a highly abstracted reconstruction of material sampled from Italian electro-pop group Slow Motion. It's gloriously accessible pop/noise, oddly song-like, with alternating beams of fuzzy drone that suggest a chord progression. It takes a shoegazey turn when high, harmonizing voices (or brilliant mechanical facsimile thereof) waft in, like a couple of Wilson brothers trapped in the guts of the machine and trying to sing their way out. At only 3:30, I've no choice but to repeat it endlessly. But blissed-out drone is only part of the story here. If there's a consistent thread, it's Alog's playfulness, their light touch and wry humor that can occasionally veer toward the twee. ""Just Recording"" begins with sleigh bells and prayer bowls, but the cloud of incense is pushed out with a weird chorus of clipped, percussive vocalizations from a mixture of kids and adults (it was apparently recorded at a children's school using the facilities instruments on hand). ""Something Like Islands of Memory"" sounds like something from a Tomlab release, with its dreamy backward guitar mixed with a woman's laughter garbled in a faulty tape machine. ""Hej, Vart Blev Det Av Dat'en, Kim?"" (""Hi, where did the DAT-tape go, Kim?"") lays the answering machine voice of Norwegian producer Kim Hirothøy atop a recording of his entire CD being played on fast-forward, so that the 50-minute album is heard in four. Screwing around, you say? Maybe, but always with a sense of purpose, and with ears wide open. Obviously, given its castaways and cutouts nature, Catch That Totem! isn't all brilliant, but even the lesser tracks hold my interest. I'd finish by saying that the inspiring sonic imagination of Alog deserves a much bigger audience, but a couple weeks ago they picked up a Spellemann Award Miniatures. Their website explains that a Spellemann is a ""Norwegian Grammy."" Now that's my kind of country.

Rough Trade Counter Culture 05,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84ec0084474cd0c0dd2/1:1/w_160/95a39224.gif,2006-02-20 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2092-rough-trade-counter-culture-05/,Rough Trade,"Sigh. It's so hard to be a tastemaker, you all have no idea. Sure, it's probably tough to be a doctor or a soldier or a fireman, but really, when you think about, being a tastemaker is probably the most difficult occupation of all. It's such a drag having to wade through all that music, year in and year out, to find the few diamond needles in the overwhelming publicist-baled haystack. Then, of course, there's the grueling seven-day holiday retreat where the ruling council meticulously puts the releases into proper, absolutely completely scientifically objective order. Finally, you release your definitive year-review to the public, and all the ungrateful plebes can do is hysterically bemoan the omissions and nit-pick the standings. Christ, people, how do you think we run things here, some kind of ""democratic"" poll? Our friends at the Rough Trade record shops surely understand our pain. The UK's highest-esteemed record store, Rough Trade also carries the heavy burden of the tastemaker, looked to by a thirsty world to choose what choice music was worth saving from the previous year before it drifts off into foggy memory. For four years, the record shop has obliged with a two-disc compilation summing up the last calendar year, a sort of record-store-guy-to-go package of the tracks and bands you weren't cool enough to already know about. At 50 tracks, the Rough Trade clerks certainly had plenty to endorse in 2005, and the selection sprawls across the full inventory of genres...that aren't hip-hop. Unlike the loose freak-folk/dance-punk disc-segregation of the 2004 edition, Counter Culture 05 is more of a mixed bag, appropriate for a year that didn't have a clearly definitive underground movement to feign bored embarrassment about in two-three years' time. Deftly avoiding the dangers associated with ranking, the organization of Counter Culture 05 is dictated purely by aesthetic flow, which, when you're dealing with a collection that includes both Jandek and Franz Ferdinand, is no small task. In its guise as a guide to the best work of 2005, many usual suspects appear: Low and Sleater-Kinney, Boards of Canada and Matthew Herbert, The Fall and Elvis Costello (with the Brodsky Quartet, for additional geriatricity). Unsurprisingly, Rough Trade's rookie discoveries closely parallel those of this here humble webzine in places, with the store also buying into the horrible-name/awesome-band trend headlined by Serena Maneesh, Test Icicles, and the band with the clapping and the Yeah-saying. But Counter Culture's best use is as an early warning system about UK groups that haven't quite hit the radar yet in the colonies, like the surprisingly authentic 60's-psych-pop of Modlang, girl-group revivalists the Pipettes, What's Your Rupture signees Long Blondes, or Katzenjammers, a band that-- trust me-- is represented by an excellently gritty steel-drum interpretation of Gary Numan's ""Cars"". The second disc goes on to shine a spotlight on the slept-on Pixies-cowpunk of Brakes (Rough Trade's #1 album of 2005), and shows that spastic new-wave revival is in full flight with examples from Good Shoes and CDOASS. The desire to comprehensively document the best of 2005's obscure and exotic (that aren't hip-hop) occasionally leads Counter Culture 05 to trip up on songs completely out of step with the compilation's edgy young-people tone: the throat-singing of Albert Kuvezin and Yat-Kha, for instance, or the kids' home recording project of Street Gangland Rhythms Band 1. Such inconsistency can be expected to plague any compilation with goals as ambitious as the Counter Culture series, leaving it more useful as a sampler than as a continuous listen; an appetizer for further research, not a main course. In this manner, this collection serves the noble mission of the tastemaker, graciously pointing the way towards the Promised Land of cool bands. I know your struggle, Rough Trade, and I salute thee.","UK record store spreads 50 underground favorites from last year over two discs, including tracks by Sleater-Kinney, Boards of Canada, Low, Herbert, and the Long Blondes.

Anglo techno megalopolis Warp made the Newcastle quintet its highest-profile guitar-band signing, testing waters they've also populated, however gingerly, with prog-punk instrumentalists Battles and vegetal folkies Gravenhurst. The band's first single for the label, ""Apply Some Pressure"", became its first UK Top 20 hit; when the track was reissued eight months later it became its fourth. This startling fortune made absolutely no sense. Maxïmo Park are a pop band lacking pop music's crucial feature: its immediacy. A Certain Trigger cloyed before it joyed; yes, it was a grower. I'm convinced that had partly to do with the way the band recorded the album. Favoring muted dynamics and fat, diffuse guitar and drum sounds that belied the music's rhythmic intensity, they leavened and prolonged what could've been a sugary hit-and-run. Missing Songs has my back on this one: late-album inclusion ""Apply Some Pressure (Original Demo Version)"" is basically a note-for-note reading of the souped-up album version sans ProTools filters and expensive microphones, and it's a different song for it. So it goes with this collection. The songs don't wow, but neither did/does A Certain Trigger. Rather, ""A19"" and ""My Life in Reserve"" slowly chisel brains, overcoming underwhelming sonics to bang blithe melodies. Just as on the debut, singer Paul Smith exercises an English probity that starts boring and ends up either charming or still boring, depending whether or not you have the time. The courtship is just slower with these cuts, the payoff smaller. Few tracks on A Certain Trigger can claim a moment as strong as ""My Life in Reverse""'s crude, uneasy bridge, but timid performance stifles the drama; the passage wants more measures and double the strength from its toilsome, chugalugging guitars. Give ""I Want You To Leave"" thinned-out guitars and a drier, denser drum sound, you've got Futureheads-potent punch. Instead the track, Missing Songs' most rhythmically sophisticated, feels scattered and one-dimensional. ""Stray Talk"" fails to exploit the promising tension in its stiff-strummed breakdown, surrendering resolution too quickly and easily. Those are the tracks worthiest of a re-rendering-- i.e., could ship off to a control room for grooming and undergo mods to occupy deep album slots. Others would require few tweaks at all. ""Fear of Falling"" facilitates Smith's best vocal performance by giving him least primacy, instead nearly toppling A Certain Trigger-single ""Graffiti""'s monopoly on transcendent, heavy triplet outros. ""A19"" wins for best shameless use of cheesy oscillating guitar FX, the perfect terrible-is-awesome complement to an overeager hook. Album nadir, a cover of John Lennon's ""Isolation"", mercifully aborts mission after 74 ticks. Here Smith's voice ceases to convey sweet, slightly sarcastic indifference, rather coming across achingly precious. If your range is monotone, noncommittal is always better. Such miscues and the inherent lousiness of B-sides and early cuts collections notwithstanding, Missing Songs is the rare curio that actually inspires curiosity.","Warp's first rock signing caps a successful 12 months with this collection of B-sides and demos, most of which originally appeared on UK singles.

Destroyer's Rubies,Destroyer,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab5c13d1975652139bc1/1:1/w_160/4cca5e08.jpg,2006-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/,Merge,"Those of you who keep abreast of online rumor-mongering might be surprised to find that the rating at the top of this page is a few points shy of a 10.0. No sooner had Destroyer's Rubies leaked to internet file-trading services than rumors (credited, as these things always are, to ""reliable sources"") began to spread that the album was to receive a perfect score from this publication. It wasn't until I actually sat down and gave Destroyer's Rubies a few good listens that the aptness of such a rumor really hit me: The album is structurally complex, thematically dense, and labyrinthine in its self-referentiality. Dan Bejar's vocals are, like many of his indie contemporaries, yelpy and dramatic, and many of his lyrics seem preordained to serve as mp3 blog headers. In other words, the qualities that once made Destroyer albums so ""difficult"" make Destroyer's Rubies a perfect record for this critical moment. Writing about Destroyer has proven to be, to borrow a quote from Bejar himself, ""a playground for fun."" Destroyer reviews have an unfortunate tendency to read like essays written for college seminars. Bejar's writing seems to lend itself particularly well to analysis as a ""text,"" often resulting in reviews that focus exclusively on the referentiality of his lyrics. But, while listening to Destroyer's Rubies, I think many writers-- myself included-- have been missing the point. At its core, Destroyer is an almost unfashionably conventional (or, as Bejar would say, ""classical"") project. Bejar writes well-crafted pop/rock songs that, for all their lyrical complexity, tend to be about people (usually girls) and places he knows. The obtuse character of Bejar's lyrics strikes me not as a Waste Land-esque shot at epic intertextuality, but rather a simple refusal to write things that will make sense to everybody. If more singer/songwriters wrote lyrics without stopping to explain every single reference, or reducing their thoughts to poetic-sounding generalities, Bejar's lyrics might not seem so impenetrable. Yet, while some have been busy puzzling out every reference in every Destroyer song, Bejar has been quietly and consistently honing his craft, putting out albums that are uniformly strong but thoroughly unique in their musical sensibilities. Though 2001's Streethawk: A Seduction stands as his most concise and catchy record, 2002's much-maligned This Night was a triumph in its own right. With more-reverb-than-guitar guitars, more-fill-than-drumbeat drumbeats, and choruses that mostly consisted of ""ba ba ba"" or ""la la la,"" Bejar recast musical excess as the core and foundation of a surprisingly solid rock album. With 2004's Your Blues, he dabbled in flamboyantly theatrical vocals and canned MIDI instruments, committing two of the very few aesthetic crimes that might have effectively dismantled the substantial buzz that was building around Destroyer. Which brings us to Destroyer's Rubies, Bejar's seventh, and best, full-length as Destroyer. The album's nearly 10-minute self-titled opening track makes clear that whatever Bejar may have lost in terms of precision he has made up in versatility. Structurally, ""Rubies"" is remarkably sophisticated, cycling through several mini-verses but never congealing into any standard song form. Built around a few simple themes, ""Rubies"" covers a great deal of ground both musically and emotionally as Bejar's characteristically serpentine melody carries him through careening guitar hooks, military snare drum fills, and a strikingly spare acoustic guitar finale. The endlessly catchy ""Painter in Your Pocket"" opens with a similarly stark acoustic guitar intro, then unexpectedly builds up more bounce and swing than any Destroyer song to date. By the time the song reaches its final chorus, it has attained a blissful, sing-songy energy that hasn't really graced any Destroyer record since Streethawk. The success of epic songs like ""Rubies"" and ""Painter in Your Pocket"" owes a great deal to Bejar's development as a singer. While Streethawk is considered by most fans to be the best Destroyer record, Bejar's vocal performance seems stifled and flat in comparison to Destroyer's Rubies. On Your Blues, Bejar's substantial growth as a vocalist was more or less entirely obscured by the record's synthetic accompaniment. But over the course of Destroyer's Rubies, Bejar coos, hisses, and snarls with uncharacteristic confidence. He's always had a knack for unique phrasing in his melodies, and his newfound expressive range greatly enhances their impact. Unfortunately, the album does falter a bit toward its end. ""A Dangerous Woman Up to a Point"" substantially outstays its welcome, ultimately coming across like a half-assed rehash of ""Looter's Follies"". ""Priest's Knees"" is sorely lacking in melody, and probably could have been omitted altogether. The album's closing track, ""Sick Priest Learns to Last Forever"", pushes the bar-band-from-hell aesthetic a bit too far, and winds up living up to its name in a rather unflattering manner. Given the generally high quality of the songs on Destroyer's Rubies, these bouts of sloppiness come off as particularly frustrating. But while Destroyer's Rubies is by no means a flawless record, its most glaring flaws are for the most part mercifully self-contained.

Western Store,Isolée,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a7c0084474cd0c2671/1:1/w_160/b118676e.gif,2006-02-19 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4163-western-store/,Playhouse,"An answer to the album-format addicts who couldn't understand where Isolée had been in between 2000's Rest and 2005's crossover hit We Are Monster, newly released compilation LP Western Store is the Smoking Gun Report tracking Rajko Müller's 12"" alibis. Less like a singles comp than an album ex-post-facto, Western Store resequences 11 tracks (all culled from five EPs, some pre-dating Rest) out of chronological order. Perhaps this explains a few notable absences, like where's the fucking bonus disc of Müller's genius remix work (in which he both out-freaks Ricardo Villalobos and out-funks Recloose)-- or indeed whither few non-Playhouse productions and remixes, like his florid International Pony rework or his heartstopping, breaks-based ""It's About"" from Freundinnen? But these are quibbles; if Western Shore falls short of definitive, it's deep enough to display Müller's range-- and, perhaps more importantly, offers a sufficiently unorthodox take on electronic body music to convince all those indie critics who Pazz & Jopped We Are Monster into the top 50 to take another look at the Playhouse back catalogue. House is a feeling, and the way Isolée gropes his way through it, eyes closed and twitchy fingertipped, should be enough to lure the staunchest four-to-the-floorphobes into the dark corners behind the kick drum. A convoluted doc, Western Store opens with the hesitant, bewildered off-rhythms of someone stumbling back from the wilderness. It's an interesting bit of narrative revisionism, given that ""Bleu"" dates from Isolée's third, not first, Playhouse 12"", but it's a smart move, pulling together in one stroke machinic, Säkho-styled techno, up-front house rhythms, and the pinging dub of Rhythm and Sound, as if to banish techno's conventional timelines altogether. With ""Initiate II"", the disc dives into the cavernous vocal house of Luomo, but Müller's garish Rhodes and itchy hi-hats jerk against the soporific effects in a way that Luomo's never do. These aren't, actually, the disc's best tracks; those would be the quartet from Play 018, the EP also titled Western Store: ""Rockers"", ""Surfers"", ""Simone Rides"", and ""King Off"". Despite a low-slung electric bassline, ""Rockers"" has nothing to do with rock'n'roll-- nor with reggae, for that matter. A tin-can and fingersnap percussive jam, it's a virtual blueprint for, well, almost every current track in a Wighnomys vein, right down to the use of reverb as an instrument. Every drum has its own little pocket of airspace and a frequency so unique you could tune a radio to it. ""Surfers"" plays with the same ideas, but with some detuned chords starts to explore the sickly melodicism of Rest, while ""Simone Rides"" and ""King Off"" creep further into the humming darkness. These tracks show a taste of Isolée to come, as he begins kinking up his fishing wire, throwing weird little hooks-- neither verse nor chorus nor bridge-- into otherwise solidly ""tracky,"" non-songlike constructions. ""Cité Grande Terre"" may open as a traditional dub-techno track, but the doubletime crackle and anxious bass bumping beneath might as well be part of a different song altogether; once again, Müller's doing the work of the DJ ahead of time. The one-and-a-quarter minute ""Poisson Mort"", similarly, sounds like what you might get if you fast-forwarded through Rest at 16x. By ""Lost"", which equips the early years' clatter with enormous, pie-in-the-sky Pink Floyd melodies, jazz chords, and Detroit techno balladry, the Monster inside begins to stir. Segue giving way to segue, this is where the Rest author gets restless and gives free rein to all the hooks and riffs and meta-motifs swimming around in the soupy innards of his sequencer. It's not easy listening, but that's ""Beau Mot Plage"", the unexpected breakaway hit that got Müller licensed by a thousand ""shitty"" (his word) Ibiza comps. Who knows why Playhouse went with Freeform Five's Latin-jazz ""Freeform Reform"" (which was comped more often than the original anyway); the tinselly electro original isn't just more appropriate an inclusion, it's better-- no less breezily Balearic than the remix, but simply lighting the beach with a phosphorus tide line instead of sweeping halogens, the better to illuminate, in the most natural way, Isolée's most unnatural approach to spinning glassy strands out of granulated blips.","An answer to the album-format addicts who couldn't understand where Isol\xE9e had been in between 2000's Rest ...

X-Amounts,Controller.Controller,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70db1335d7bf1698f82/1:1/w_160/e8289c96.jpg,2006-02-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1769-x-amounts/,Paper Bag,"Vocalist Nirmala Basnayake may be the face of Controller.Controller, but the band's palpitating heart is drummer Jeff Scheven. His beats are so sturdy you could tie just about anything to them and it'd sound okay. His basic stock in trade is the epitome of ""dance-punk,"" with plenty of hi hat on the upstroke, kick drum on all fours, and crackling snare fills. The rest of the band picks up more on the dance and less on the punk half of his approach-- bassist Ronnie Morris has clearly listened to some disco, and guitarists Scott Kaija and Colwyn Llewellyn-Thomas alternately lock in with the rhythm section and ride it. The band's debut EP, 2004's History, was a tight package of urgent rhythm and catchy melody. A full-length gives the band a chance to develop, but unfortunately the format also gives them more room to stray from their core sound, highlighting that they're not as good at slower songs as they are at break-neck floor stormers. ""Rooms"" in particular feels ponderous, weighed down by heavy riffing and a lack of buoyancy, and the little electronic interlude that follows isn't really doing them any favors either. God, that sounds awful, doesn't it? As much as I hate to rain on a band's attempts to diversify its sound, though, my ears and the various parts of me that like to dance say the discofied barnstormer ""Magnetic Strip"" and throbbing opener ""Tigers Not Daughters"" are where it is for Controller.Controller. Basnayake's clipped, deadpan alto loves to hug a groove, and she's at her melodic best on ""Heavy as a Heart"", where she syncopates her vocal across the groove, dueling with some blister-fingered lead guitar. Toward the end of the song, a few of her male band members join in for some surprisingly Fleetwood Mac-ish harmonies, and it works really well. ""Poison/Safe"" is the best cut on the record with its tense, airless verses, barbed wire guitars and stunning groove, the bass line holding steady as the guitars change chords around it. Controller.Controller's first album is an overall solid effort, and at its best it's capable of inducing a nervous twitch in even the most sedentary listener's legs. There are no individual songs as bracingly vital as ""History"" and ""Sleep Over It"" from on the EP (though ""the Raw No"" recycles part of the former's melody at about thirty fewer beats per minute), but those are an admittedly high benchmark. X-Amounts doesn't fully deliver on the History EP's promise, but it should be enough to keep the Toronto band on the map.","Toronto-based indie rockers follow an impressive EP with their debut Paper Bag full-length.

Hudson Bell also happens to be the name of the three-piece band that he fronts. When the Sun Is the Moon, the band's third album, is a nostalgic blend of acoustic balladry and fuzzed-out guitars. It's a somewhat unexpected combination, but one that here is full of warmth and emotion as Bell's dry vocals and charming melodies weave throughout each song, blending indie pop with psychedelia in a way that sounds at once fresh and familiar. Opener ""Slow Burn"" spends almost two-and-a-half of its eight minutes bellowing distorted guitar. Instead of heavy power chords, it's more of a drifting fuzz, a quality that colors much of the album's lead guitar work. Throughout the record, the tempo and tones hardly waver, creating a consistent mood throughout. The band mixes dusty southern-style rock with breezy pop on ""The Falls"", and ""Seven Cities"" shuffles along with layered vocals and drunken, ethereal guitar leads. Another highlight is ""The Midnight Year"", which begins as upbeat and bright before it's sounds give way to church bells and droning guitar fuzz. Soon everything fades, and lapping ocean waves and chirping birds introduce the song's second movement, a contemplative, slow-picked instrumental, complete with lonesome harmonica wails. At seven songs in under 40 minutes, When the Sun Is the Moon at first appears a bit slight. But three of the tracks clock in at well over seven minutes, and the nostalgic, sentimental feel to the music seems to stretch it somehow, making the album feel longer than it is. Closer ""Sea Horse"" utilizes quiet organ drones, lush guitar strumming, and soaring vocal harmonies to bring everything together, and, along with ""Slow Burn"", bookends a rich, delicate album.","Three-piece indie band concocts a nostalgic blend of acoustic balladry and fuzzed-out guitars.

Toy,TOY,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b75e6ef9596932128e/1:1/w_160/c1e38b0c.jpg,2006-02-16 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8313-toy/,Smalltown Supersound,"Considering that Toy craft music that sounds like an imaginative childhood soundtrack, it's apt that they claim to have met in the Casio keyboard department on the fifth floor of London's premier toyshop, Hamleys. This curiously humorous and bold debut album from UK native Alisdair Stirling and Bergen-based composer/producer Jorgen Traeen conjures up images of rickety funfair rides, bustling amusement arcades, and the familiar, tinny spark of early 90s Super Mario bonus levels. Although occasionally congealing into a molasses-thick clog of processed beats and frivolous superflouites, for the most part Toy retains a magical charm. The variety of animated textures and samples sound like a dusting of icing sugar over what would otherwise be little more than an oddly infectious foray into lo-fi techno. As their name implies, Toy tend to create their music using instruments specifically designed for children. That these seemingly ""naïve"" or ""primitive"" sounding materials are being employed by two widely respected musicians-- Traeen is the guy behind Sir Dupermann and runs one of Norway's best recording studios; Stirling plays in the Bergen collective House of Hiss and Sensible Twins-- really makes this record work. By approaching what could be seen as a limited selection of instruments to make their soundscapes, Stirling and Traeen are encouraged to use their musical initiative to wring all potential out of them. And they do. On tracks such as ""Realistic Martian Landing Set"", happy-go-lucky beats mix with the abrupt fuzz of distorted Casio bleeps and heavier piano tones to form distinctively bizarre trails of sounds rich with visual imagery. It sounds like the soundtrack to a B-movie sci-fi flick. There are also some especially effective moments, such as the addition of toy xylophones and reverb at the track's close, which leaves a glistening flicker of notes that sound like ice spilling over marble slabs. Not all of Toy's influences are woven from childhood knick-knacks, however. There are also strong echoes of Japanese electronica like Cornelius and Zongamin, the atmospheric, bleeding dub of Silver Apples, and even the scuffling, muscular rhythmic tension of groups like Tussle. Although Traeen and Stirling's creations cast a loose net in terms of musical variety and ideas, their sound is very specific and unlikely to appeal to a wide audience. Toy's characteristically playful melodies could be interpreted as a whim in danger of turning into a one trick pony. But like many ambitious and eccentric projects, one is left with the feeling that this is unique enough to carry them into further fields of experimentation.","Curiously humorous and bold debut album from UK native Alisdair Stirling and Bergen-based composer/producer Jorgen Traeen was created using instruments designed for children.

Idols of Exile,Jason Collett,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ebea9e61561daa548d/1:1/w_160/1efb7b21.jpg,2006-02-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1737-idols-of-exile/,Arts & Crafts,"Despite all its backward-compatible genre revision, today's indie rock is often essentially divorced from history. Appropriating conventions only insofar as they can be subverted, observing tradition only to comment upon the triteness of observing tradition, indie rock is a circuit-breaking shunt disrupting the transmission of heritage that's hardwired into genres such as blues, jazz, and even rock. Instead of tapping into a particular lineage, it tends to pull whatever flapping loose ends dominate the moment into its vortex, inscribing a narrative that begins and ends with its author's experience. If Broken Social Scene is the epitome of indie rock, with its slapdash collective aesthetic, muzzy mélange of songwriting styles, and predilection for abstracting rock until its solid historical thump becomes gaseous and hermetic, then BSS guitarist Jason Collett's solo work is an escape valve venting his pent-up traditionalist urges. Unlike his first solo album Motor Motel Love Songs, which, as a collection of Collett's early self-released material, was justifiably spotty, Idols of Exile is consistently solid; the songs are fully realized and, ultimately, memorable. Its melancholy yet optimistic worldview and bucolic charm strongly evoke the Band, another group of Canadians toying with the mythology of the American south, and its combination of this sensibility with more spectral touches aligns it with Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The most significant area of overlap between Broken Social Scene and Collett's solo work is his coarse yet mellifluous voice, which, in this stripped-down context, reveals itself as a formidable instrument, confident and nuanced, capable of complex volleys of blue notes and monolithically soaring choruses. Predictably, Idols of Exile is fleshed out by a revolving cast of Arts & Crafts regulars. Amy Millan and Kevin Drew contribute harmonies to ""Fire"", which uses grandiose symbols to allude to basic longings, a shivering synth and a variety of chiming rhythmic elements buffeting Collett's voice as it breaks like Jeff Tweedy's: ""I know you just want to be on fire."" Standout track ""We All Lose One Another"" opens with an echo of Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"", then a rolling wave of acoustic guitar, violin, and piano carries Collett's vocal toward a triumphant chorus. Leslie Feist sings back-up on the crunchy country stomper ""Hangover Days"", and Apostle of Hustle's Andrew Whiteman embroiders its rude fuzz-bass with prickly electric guitar solos. Over the course of Idols of Exile, the classic rock idiom that Collett helps to dismantle with Broken Social Scene is reassembled piece by piece. The record humbly takes its place in history's queue: Perhaps not what BSS fans are looking for, but, weighed against the impulse for continuity instead of disjunction, deeply satisfying.","Broken Social Scene guitarist's latest features contributions from his Arts & Crafts mates Leslie Feist, Amy Millan, and Kevin Drew.

But then, as the Chicago backwoods balladeers' engrossing second album attests, dying is easy; it's the living and loving part that brings trouble. The punchline to All the Love I Could Find is, unfortunately, ""not a whole lot""-- and the love Salveter does find is only legal in certain Southern states. His absence-makes-the-heart-go-flounder despair is reflected in the band's skeletal arrangements, which assume the sunstroked stumble of Crazy Horse (c.f. ""Cortez the Killer"") and the Dirty Three's desert-dragging dirges. And standing in for Neil's signature one-note leads and Warren Ellis' weeping violin is an equally distressing instrument: Salveter's distinctive vocal, a death-bed confessional tremble that doesn't so much suggest a lump in his throat as a tumor. Like his cow-punk patriarch Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Salveter is by turns petrified and cocksure, and never at a loss for sly, self-effacing witticisms: The solipsistic chorus to ""You Can't Help Those People"" at first sounds almost self-parodic (""Ain't nobody's troubles like mine/ I had no other girl on my mind/ The one I wanted was a crime""), but the smirks turn to shock as those words assume a more disturbing context next to ""Cousin"", a collaboration with Kelly Hogan that sympathetically chronicles an affair between relations in uncomfortably intimate terms (""I'd wake up at night to watch you pissing""). Though the band insists that many of these songs are based on real-life experience, Salveter's narratives often obscure the line between reality and myth. As reflected by the album's uniformly languorous gait, the only certainty here is misery, and at times, being dragged through this chasmal bleakness can seem endless: ""Torture"" crawls along for an agonizing seven minutes, but merely states the obvious: ""I'm feeling blue/ There's no seeing you."" But despite such lows, the rousing ""Cause of It"" reaches an extraordinary peak, as Salveter reveals his deepest truth: ""I want it, I want it to feel/ Like Sam Cooke or Patti Labelle."" And in a way, he succeeds. Through his public suffering of separation anxiety, guilt, shame, and a broad-ranging spectrum of other unpleasant emotions, All the Love I Could Find itself becomes Salveter's very real salvation: He feels how he does so we don't have to.","Second album from Chicago's backwoods balladeers features a contribution from Kelly Hogan and shares the same spirit as the work of Jeffrey Lee Pierce.

Prog Is Not a Four Letter Word,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a865b1335d7bf1699291/1:1/w_160/24684635.jpg,2006-02-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2114-prog-is-not-a-four-letter-word/,Delay 68,"All these years removed from the scene of the ""crimes,"" there is still no shortage of bigotry against music at one time considered to be the future of rock. In the late 60s and early 70s, progressive rock was not only critically acclaimed, buy actually cool, at least to hipster intelligentsia. It was still just a part of psychedelia, acid rock, or any number of things not stigmatized by people who might later look back in anger-- in fact, much like how Animal Collective, Liars, and Deerhoof are somehow ""indie rock"" today even when they might just as well represent new genres altogether. Yet, it didn't take very long for conventional opinions to change-- perhaps only two or three years-- when many listeners and critics jumped ship for more fashionable seas (and probably not coincidentally, ones that would ultimately run ashore at punk and New Wave at the end of the 70s). Why did this happen? I have my theories: many prog bands left ""the people"" behind in some respects, opting for longer songs, out-er experiments, and flashier performances; the apparent demise of the dreams of the 60s meant that utopian ideals of enhanced consciousness and experimentation fell by the wayside to make room for suitably rawer, rougher sounds; progressive politics of the time (and to this day) dictated that social and economic elitism disabled a big chunk of society, so when you're playing music that takes 10 years of education and a healthy bank of equipment to produce, it doesn't exactly scream ""populism."" Of course, even in the best, most well meaning scenarios, a ton of great music got brushed over. Luckily, a lot of this stuff is being rediscovered today, as digital music communities and the information silo of the internet are helping right a generation of wrongs. British DJ, producer, Twisted Nerve label boss, and rabid vinyl collector Andy Votel compiled Prog Is Not a Four Letter Word from what must be a massive collection, and makes clear what many a die-hard prog fan will tell you: If you think you know all the faces of this music, you've got another thing coming. Sampling bands from all over the world, his set makes a pretty good case for progressive rock's diversity, as well as its ample potential for DJs looking for new breaks. The music here almost completely eschews flashy solos and epic song-suites in favor of a very psychedelic flavor of prog, with jazzy touches and an almost melancholy aftertaste. As with his Folk Is Not a Four Letter Word comp, I suspect he had an agenda in mind of challenging assumptions about the genre, and for better or worse, he succeeds. Italian band Picchio Dal Pozzo leads off the set with ""Merta"", and makes immediately clear that this will not be a wizard's cap run-through. Forming a drone out of bells, acoustic guitar and a moaning synth line that wouldn't sound out of place in a Lindstrom track, the song is gentle and mystical, like opening the door to a wild, yellow garden. Likewise, French composer (and Serge Gainsbourg associate) Jean Claude Vannier's ""Le Roi Des Mouches"" uses an Eastern-tinged orchestral arrangement, peppered with hand drums and acoustic guitars to make exquisite chill music, the kind that would go perfectly with just a touch of incense and something a bit less legal. English proggers Egg (featuring players who would go on to form signature Canterbury bands Gong and National Health) drop a version of J.S. Bach's ""Fugue In D Minor"" that recalls not the warmed over ELP-style classical gas, but the pastoral psych of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"". Bands like Germany's Embryo and French artist Phillipe Besombes demonstrate similarly subtle takes on jazz fusion. Of course, as a sometime prog-geek myself, there are choices I'd have made differently. Ultra-obscure Welsh act Bran play quaint art song on ""Breuddwyd"", but why choose this when there are so many better examples of chamber classical influences in prog (e.g., Renaissance, Slapp Happy, even Magma)? Also, songs by San Ui Lim and Czerwone Gitary barely seem like prog to my ears, rather closer to sub-Nuggets folk rock and something way too close to a Foghat jam, respectively. In truth, there is an aspect of cratedigging here at the occasional expense of truly incredible tunes; it's a shame, because slightly better known (and frankly much better) bands like Lard Free, Supersister, Moving Gelatine Plates, early Soft Machine, Brainticket, and Plastic People of the Universe would have fit in perfectly. Still, it's difficult to nitpick much. Prog Is Not a Four Letter Word is nice on its own terms, and I'm all for opening doors to a ripe canon of music unjustly maligned. Seek and you shall find: There's more good music out there than jaded hipsters and critics might let on.","Andy Votel-created compilation is a follow-up of sorts to Folk Is Not a Four Letter Word and features contributions from artists based in Poland, Italy, and Turkey, among other nations.

There's the Montreal mailing address, the cluelessly offensive name, the awkward hairy-fairy nude photos, and the fact that Wolf Parade's Arlen Thompson helped record the eight tracks that make up the official debut (though they spelled his last name wrong in the liner notes). More impressive than geography and failed shock value is that half the group, Special Deluxe and Hiroshima Eye, moonlight as the well-regarded anarchic screen-printing graphic designers, Seripop. Visually AIDS Wolf exhibits that same sly Seripop aesthetic acumen. Musically, not so much. Until now, the quartet's put out a split 7-inch with the Fugue and a bunch of limited, cassette-only releases. So why the fuss? On a generous day, the sound's a decades-late take on Teenage Jesus & the Jerks or a boring revision of the more recent Chicagoan no-wave of the Scissor Girls. I cheaply affix those not-quite-right examples because of AIDS Wolf's female vocalist, but the tempos are more comparable to split-at-the-seams Arab On Radar and a less technically apt Flying Luttenbachers. That the kids have been together since April 2003 but remain embroiled in such generic misfires is indicative of the band's priorities. I'm a sucker for musical insistence, so I like opener ""Spit Taste Like Metal"" for its guitar jabs, spiraling tiny little needles in your ears. But even when the guitars are entertaining, Special Deluxe's super thin howls are placed at the center. (At times, she's wisely placed back in the mix.) The guitars themselves sink once it's clear the same line of attack is repeated from song to song to song. By track four, ""The Hat Collector"", the tediousness is grating and by the album's close, you've completely forgotten that they're playing. Following standard album composition tropes, the last track, ""Some Sexual Drawings"", lasts almost 12 minutes, as compared to the seven one- to two-minute blasts before it. (All said, the album's under a half an hour long.) For the grand magus they dig in and explore, but no more than any noisy-minded posse would cobble together if you handed 'em some instruments and asked 'em to rock. Please come back, Harry Pussy, noise needs you. The formula? Wailed vocals, jaggedly angular guitars, tumbling drums, and pinball ricochets. A major technique pairs escalating rhythms mixed-up with Special D's increased vocal agitations: It's like the band's always building and never arriving anywhere, though rather than slyly confounding expectations, it's just lazy. Ultimately, the posturing that scored AIDS Wolf pre-release press may also lead to their undoing. It's clear the wild-child rhetoric surrounding the release of The Lovvers LP is an attempt at selling chaos as a lifestyle-- god, it's really hard to buy into this stuff when each shard feels incredibly calculated. As performance art the stuff's suburban and tame; as music it's weak, but if AIDS Wolf gets anywhere it won't be the first (or last) time style's trumped substance. It is surprising, though, that supposedly astute music fans can be force-fed such watered-down pablum when it's well packaged. The blogs and boards are already wondering whether it's rock or if it's noise. Maybe it's a joke? For now, let's just call it shit in wolf's clothing. ","Much-hyped debut album from the Montreal no-wave revivalists and Wolf Parade compatriots seems designed to sell chaos as a lifestyle.

You'd think after all the Zappa/Waits/Beefheart darts thrown his way after the band's 2004 debut, lead singer Honus Honus would cut the gravel shtick-- the stache, too. Instead, he seems to have bought all three's entire discographies over again, zeroing in on Waits' freak empathy, Zappa's klezmatics and turnarounds, the Captain's sense of surprise. We know exactly what he's building in there. In the process, though, Honus lost his former bandmates, and possibly a lot more. This big-top ringleader whose barely prophetic ramblings and nauseous yelps we delighted in last time around as mere entertainment now asks us to move closer, listen not to the sounds, but to the songs-- the pleas for help. I didn't expect people to dig The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face, same reason I wouldn't drag them to Deerhoof or put a plastic snake in their drink as a joke. Unfocused and sloppy and more of-the-moment than of-the-whole, that record was possibly the polar opposite of what some people value musically. This time out, Man Man's less sloppy but just as ramshackle, as if the snaps and crackles are the band's diversion from actually writing the record. As a song and title, the breakneck ""Young Einstein on the Beach"" might be more self-referential than the band intended. They're still tending to the same changes, the same high-pitched call-and-response tropes, and the waltz time, and those parts can blur together a bit. But plenty of good moments pop out by relation: that ""mous-tache mous-tache mous-tache"" breakdown on ""Push the Eagle's Stomach"" with video game power-up sounds as the retrigger, the song's ""So What"" ending, the guitarless Sabbath riffs, the weird keyboard sound halfway between ""96 Tears"", and the noise made when two rubber Little Caesars dolls are scrubbed together. Or take the accordion melody on ""Banana Ghost"", or the dozens of great lyrical turns, such as on the appropriately sparse ""Skin Tension"" (""Let down my guard/ And there goes my heart/ Straight out the window again""), or on ""Black Mission Goggles"", something of a misfit toy remake of ""Come Together"" (Beatles, not Annie): ""She's a warm bodega/ High on Noreaga,"" Honus shouts, thus giving Jens Lekman a run for his rap ref rep. Just so you know, the line after ""Noreaga"" is this: ""Strung out in Brooklyn cos I love her."" Happens a lot here: The fun stops, the façade is dropped for a split second, and suddenly Man Man's circus act isn't nearly as interesting as the tension of them maintaining it. That push/pull is why Six Demon Bag sticks so much more than the last. Granted, the band relies on the same structure for most of these moments-- percussion drops out, locker-room singing, then the sober line-- but damnit can they do sober: ""You should always run with a loaded gun in your mouth,"" or, ""When the night breaks, and the clouds shake, and your hopes ache, to someday be redeemed,"" or, ""I know I'll never be the man that she thinks she really needs/ But it don't stop me from trying to be."" Despite/because, Man Man's most focused song here is also their most debilitating. On ""Van Helsing Boombox"", Honus hums and whistles along to the bell hook, delaying himself from articulating the actualities of a breakup: learning ""how to speak a forgotten language"", wanting ""to sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet,"" falling in the street and howling at the moon. Think of the man you most admire-- your father, maybe-- then remember the first time you saw him cry. The song hits like that: broken and embarrassed and yards of dirt more convincing than your Glibbards and Blight Eyes. Why ""Van Helsing"" works so well as an album track, though, is it really heightens the sudden change of heart on closer ""Ice Dogs"": Starts stubborn (""Am I supposed to close my eyes as you walk away from me?"") but how quickly that old love again comes back-- chirpy horns, girl group shoo-wops, smiles for smiles. It's pathetic. It's fantastic drama, too-- rare for any work, let alone a fucking rock album, to pull off so well in 40 minutes. ""C'est la vie/ Don't abandon me/ When the bridge burns down and the bad blood tastes like wine."" Punch-drunk and happy for now, but it's still blood.","Sophomore album from Philly-based Waits/Zappa/Beefheart obsessives asks us this time out not to merely delight in its sounds, but in its songs as well.

Unfortunately,Shalabi Effect,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b85e6ef959693206e1/1:1/w_160/7d0e75ad.jpg,2006-02-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7092-unfortunately/,Alien8,"Montreal's Shalabi Effect have only been releasing records since 1998, but they've covered a lot of ground. Staffed with strong and versatile musicians, all of whom, one presumes, have large record collections, they're able to move in whatever direction their improv-craving hearts desire. If it's true such outfits are sometimes easier to admire as a ""project"" than an actual musical experience, there's always an appealing moment of anticipation when a new record comes on the market: What's this one going to sound like? Though there is no crowd noise and the recording quality is excellent, Unfortunately is a live album, capturing the band at a Montreal arts festival in May 2005. Across nine tracks they dabble in virtually every style they've shown, foregoing only extended drones and side-long psych jams. The opening ""Out of the Closet"" is a slowly burning ember of creepiness á la Nurse With Wound, with creaking noises of indeterminate origin mixed with wounded, moaning vocals. How this amalgamation of electronics played out onstage I can only guess, but the band switches gears immediately on ""Pai Nai"", fusing Middle Eastern scales to a grubby mod guitar instrumental. ""Early Reptilian Memories"" is a rumbling percussive throwdown, with two or three sets of hands working over kits beneath more impenetrable vocalizing, and it bleeds into a sound collage of Arabic voices and the noise rock of ""Monobrow"". This is followed into the delicate acoustic plucking of ""Half Life"", backed by subtle samples and effects, and then into ""Beluga"", which sounds like a twisted version of a High Llamas track. At that point, the jet lag starts to set in. The genre-hopping works because Shalabi Effect seem comfortable in different settings, but at the same time, none of these tracks stand out among the best of their kind. When the band flips the fakebook to droning raga-rock on ""Harpie"" its true strength is revealed. There's time to breath as Sam Shalabi's patiently explores of a single chord; oud, guitar and tabla wind themselves around each other in a serpentine dance that may as well go on forever. Unfortunately is an effective and honest Shalabi Effect sampler, but a half-dozen albums worth of ideas fly by without really sticking. More than anything it points up that these guys thrive on limitation.","This live album was recorded at an arts festival in the genre-hopping Alien8 band's hometown of Montreal.

The Color of Memory,The Vandermark Five,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a911b1335d7bf1699425/1:1/w_160/1190a191.jpg,2006-02-15 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8399-the-color-of-memory/,Atavistic,"Life as a jazz musician must be tough these days. Forget the ever-shrinking number of venues in which to ply your craft and low sales figures-- the worst thing about it must be constantly hearing about how your art form is dying, dead, or long dead. Jazz may no longer hold the hallowed place in the American consciousness it once did, but it's far from dead, and Vandermark 5 are one of the groups doing their share to keep it alive. Their music is primarily descended from two of jazz's most radical strains, hard bop and free jazz, and on their eighth album, the quintet is in sharp form over two sprawling discs. Ken Vandermark's compositions here reflect two distinct areas of his headspace-- four of them lean hard on wild improvisation, abrasive texture, and intensity, and the other four offer a more lyrical, traditional perspective on the group's interplay. Personally, I'm fonder of the latter, and the difference is pronounced enough that separating the two camps on the two discs might actually have made sense. With upright bass, drums, two saxes/clarinets, and trombone, the band has a unique texture, and the harmonic structure of the songs is sometimes very ambiguous. ""That Was Now (for the Volcano Suns)"" is a challenging opener, with bassist Kent Kessler and drummer Tim Daisy laying down a free bop rhythmic foundation for the horns to fight over. The rhythm section drops out completely for a few passages of unaccompanied horn madness, the kind of flights that invented the word ""skronk."" ""Burn Nostalgia (for Art Pepper)"" operates in a similar vein, but ""Camera (for Edward Weston)"" takes the group's out tendencies in another direction, opening with a long, eerie build on which Vandermark, Jeb Bishop, and Dave Rempis play drawn out chords that sound out of time. When the rhythms do kick in, Kessler plays a bizarre line, laying on long pedal tones and slowly descending over Daisy's ride cymbal frenzy. ""Road Work (for Merce Cunningham)"" is primarily a wide-ranging conversation between Kessler and Vandermark's soprano that's as much duel as duet, though Bishop gets in some frightening blats on his trombone. The rest of the record swings, slowing for the meditative Bishop-led ballad ""Chance (for Nina Rota)"" and latching onto a sweet noir swagger on ""Suitcase (for Ray Charles, Elvin Jones and Steve Lacy)"", which features a great walking line from Kessler. ""Pieces of the Past (for Joseph H. Lewis)"" twists on a dime from driving swing to a spacy beat that the solos can really fly over. But my favorite track is ""Vehicle (for Magnus Broo)"", which features spirited, melodic playing over a breakneck groove. There are places where the band loses me a little, where some fiery playing wanders a little too far from a focused idea or the simultaneous soloing gets a bit too chattery, but this isn't much of a strike against the record. This brand of jazz is about exploration and the thrill of following it, and not every path can lead to a pot of gold. That said, The Color of Memory keeps Vandermark 5 at the forefront of contemporary jazz and should mightily please anyone who's enjoyed their past work.","Jazz great's latest is split between wild improvisation, abrasive textures, and intensity, and pieces offering a more lyrical, traditional perspective on his group's interplay.

Animalism,Animals,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1dbc0084474cd0bfef1/1:1/w_160/fd026afc.jpg,2006-02-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/500-animalism/,MGMMGM,"As with many of their 1960s contemporaries, the Animals were beholden to blues, gospel, and r&b;, even as they combined those rhythms with prevailing rock sounds. Like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, they idolized Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley, among other black American performers, and the Animals even shared a stage with Sonny Boy Williamson. Singer Eric Burdon also had the voice to sell the sound: sandpaper-raw, effortlessly loud, and, like Mick Jagger, intimately lewd, as if every lyric contained some potential double entendre. But the Animals were never as big, as good, or as dangerous as the Stones, and throughout their career they walked a fine line between the pop that made hits and the r&b; that ostensibly warranted respect. On their 1966 album Animalism, they indulge their white-soul jones more heavily than ever before, and the songs-- mostly covers-- volley between the derivative and the inventive. Hip-O Select's minimum-fuss reissue contains no bonus tracks and no involved repackaging, which actually works well for this material: With the short liner notes relegated to the back panel, this new version preserves the shape of the album and the layout of the album sleeve, which likewise preserves the original context as much as possible. Granted, even with these measures it's impossible to hear the album as it was originally intended or received, so we have only hindsight with which to judge the music. On Animalism, amid near-complete turnover of the original lineup, the Animals play up their r&b; chops on blues and soul covers, and Burdon continues to try to match his heroes by pushing his performance over the top. His voice is undeniably strong-- and this type of approach certainly had a particular appeal 40 years ago-- but his soulman affectations sound practiced, imitative rather than instinctual. Burdon oversells these songs, especially on Sam Cooke's ""Shake"" and the slow, simmering version of ""Hit the Road, Jack"", and his vocals on ""Rock Me Baby"" make the song's innuendo all too obvious. Strangely, on ""The Other Side of Life"" he takes a slightly different tack, aiming for a sound between Elvis and Jim Morrison, but he winds up sounding smaller than the former and smarter than the latter. It should be no surprise that his best performances-- also his most restrained-- are on the originals ""Outcast"" and ""Louisiana Blues"". Burdon's vocals sound more spontaneous and individual, perhaps because he doesn't have an example to mimic on these songs-- or maybe because modern listeners have no other examples against which to measure his performance. Balancing out Burdon's vocals, the Animals prove a powerful band, despite the fact that nearly half of them were new replacements. They're rock solid, but unlike their singer, they rarely showboat. Together they put the real soul in these songs. Hilton Valentine lays down some bluesy riffs on ""Smoke Stack Lightning"", but he's best when trading off with organist Dave Rowberry on ""Rock Me Baby"" and ""All Night Long"", forming a rowdy call and response. It's the rhythm section, however, that shapes the songs and allows the band to move so agilely around Burdon. Bassist Chas Chandler and drummer Barry Jenkins (a sturdy replacement for original member John Steel) put the shake in ""Shake"", pushing a swampy beat to its breaking point, and Jenkins' high hat and snare drive the up-and-down stomp on ""Lucille"". This type of playing doesn't go out of style, even if other aspects of Animalism don't have as much to tell us today.","Hip-O-Select releases the British Invasion band's 1966 album of mostly covers, on which the group indulges its white-soul jones more heavily than at any other time in its career.

Boa vs. Python / Circle. Square. Triangle / What's Your Damage?,Test Icicles,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8aeea9e61561daa58a5/1:1/w_160/3b3763b2.jpg,2006-02-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11856-boa-vs-python-circle-square-triangle-whats-your-damage/,Domino,"Post-hardcore means not being afraid of keyboards. Post-hardcore means not having to apologize for fourth-grade humor. It means you acknowledge that moshing is not the only acceptable dance move. It means you don't find it a sell-out move to commission remixes from that ""Music Sounds Better With You"" guy and his buddy. Post-hardcore means occasionally sounding like a video game. It means you don't always have to be putting your vocal cords in mortal danger, though an old-fashioned primal scream still has its time and place. Post-hardcore means it's alright to release three singles from one album. These are all things I've learned from listening to Test Icicles, and though ""post-hardcore"" may not be a wholly new or particularly accurate classification, it's how I'm hearing this London act's distinctive aesthetic. The trio never seems to stretch far from music that's aggressive, but at the same time are eager to apply the occasional spacey synth, dial down the vocals, and traffic in rhythms that do strange things to people's lower bodies. In their pop/scream dichotomy, Test Icicles remind me of Braid, another band that was once referred to as post-hardcore, but a Braid that has lived through the recent vogue of dance-punk without becoming completely cynical about its potential. Here then, to coincide with the recent stateside release of their inconsistent yet promising full-length For Screening Purposes Only, is a run-down of the band's three EPs-- one a U.S. release, the other two UK singles. One serves the role of hype harbinger, an effective primer for the various angles the band covers at this embryonic stage. The other two show the band's willingness, like their big brothers in Death From Above 1979, to submit their music to revision by dance producers, a practice I'm pretty sure Minor Threat never indulged in. Lead single ""Boa vs. Python"" is packaged with one track that also landed on the album, plus two that remain exclusive to this EP, and it serves as fitting introduction to the band's rambunctious sound. The tone on the title track is heavier than most of what's to be found on For Screening Purposes Only, but any threat of the band maintaining their scary pose is undercut by a playful garage-rock organ. ""All You Need Is Blood"" also seems vaguely threatening at the start, but doesn't take off until the band slips into a hi-hat driven groove and Advantage NES-riffing. ""LMNO Hoes"" is a jokey speed-core throwaway, but ""What's in the Box"" reveals the band's Brainiac heritage in satisfying fashion, nailing the mini-Moog squiggles and hysterical delivery better than most Timmy Taylor disciples. The other two singles are remix-heavy and fall into the category of ""for fans only,"" each sporting a pair of makeovers that run the full gamut from stunningly bad to bizarrely, fascinatingly bad. ""Circle. Square. Triangle"" is the better of the two source materials, but suffers the greatest disservice, including an endless, recasting that reaches new valleys with a (hopefully) tongue-in-cheek MC endorsing ""techno-math-rap is the best."" The blander ""What's Your Damage?"" draws in the bigger names, with Digitalism turning in an evil-sounding treatment partially undone by the defanged slow tempo, while Alan Braxe & Fred Falke whip up an absurd juxtaposition of New Romantic keyboards with the original track's throat torture. All these outside influences, then, provide repeated proof that Test Icicles are usually better off trusting their own instincts. The best moments on For Screening Purposes Only manage to hit just the right mixture of sounds-- hardcore diversified by synth intrusions and dance-punk given a more dangerous sheen. It's a balance that's thrown off by these attempts to reorganize the components. As such, only the isolationist ""Boa vs. Python"" fairly represents the promise Test Icicles and the current iteration of post-hardcore have to offer.","With the For Screening Purposes Only album getting a recent U.S. release we round up the band's trio of EPs and singles.

Young for Eternity,The Subways,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ce13d197565213927c/1:1/w_160/7ae41d50.jpg,2006-02-14 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7845-young-for-eternity/,SireWarner Bros.,"Never mind the bollocks, the story here lies in marketing. This Hertfordshire trio stands about one million Internet hits away from enacting The Arctic Monkeys Rule, shooting straight up the charts compliments of the Google guys and Al Gore. Also like the Monkeys, the Subways shrewdly shy away from Vines-style megalomania or Chris Martin's brand of heavy-handed magnanimity while also remaining as stylistically vague as possible, resembling the last 15 years of rock residue rather than any one or two particular bands. Together with the Monkeys, these guys could start a movement to supersede the UK's Coldplay bloc with a legion of post-pubescent bands wielding cool record collections and above-average riffs. For now though, they're just another indie tabula rasa hoping for fans' nostalgia to fill in the blanks. The biggest snag in the band's bubbly, youthful overthrow, as well as what pales them next to the Monkeys, lies in the album title's unfulfilled promise: For a bunch of college-aged rockers, the Subways sounds haggard and earnest. Blame it on the band's tame, cutesy nature (frontman Billy Lunn and bassist Charlotte Cooper are dating and have a Sonny & Cher call-and-response thing going on many tracks) or the soporific hand of the Coral and I Am Kloot producer Ian Broudie, but too often the rawk they bring feels terribly labored. Case in point, opener ""I Want to Hear What You Have Got to Say"" follows the same soft intro/blaring chorus storyteller formula Franz minted with ""Jacqueline"", though the first-person plot/plea doesn't stick. The title track really exposes the adrenaline deficit as Lunn rips the riff from Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Date With the Night"" for the song's flaccid climax. Of course, the album's not necessarily all limp mimicry and bark-over-bite attitude. ""Holiday"" takes a commendable stab at sneering, off-the-cuff Beatles hard rock á la Nirvana, and closer ""Somewhere"" bends if not breaks the Brit-rock stereotype with its chunky prog riffage and unconventional structuring. Unfortunately, there's no messiah to lift up this ho-hum album up by its bootstraps. Instead we get the Anti-Christ, single ""Rock N' Roll Queen"", an allegedly tongue-in-cheek homage to Alice Cooper that has afforded the band an O.C. Mix spot in the U.S. and the highest chart position of their four Top 30 singles at home. Forget hipsters downloading eight different remixes of the track on their iPod Nanos, this single aims for high school football warmup mixes and keg-stand background music. Not that there's anything wrong with Jock Jams, but sheesh, who wants a poor man's Libertines album with one foot in the locker room door?","English trio is the latest group to earn buzz for its bubbly, youthful guitar pop.

Come Clarity,In Flames,by: Cory D.

At once perfecting and defining the ""Gothenburg Sound"", the band has spent the past decade facing the prospect of living up to their own reputation. While many others have built upon In Flames' style, the band has slowly evolved; many fans would argue that they've gone too far in the wrong direction, while others would claim they've spent far too much time spinning their wheels. On their past few albums, attempts at experimentation have often resulted in the opposite-- radio-ready nu-metal. Come Clarity has been hailed as a return to form. Album opener ""Take this Life"" is full of promise, kicking things off with breakneck speed and thick riffing. The verses are full of shredded screaming, while the choruses smooth the vocals out over staccato palm-muted guitars. It's a formula In Flames has worked with for years, and there's obviously no reason to noodle around with it. In fact, all of the songs that stick to this basic combination of death metal speed and vocals, power metal guitar harmonies and melodies, and rapid time changes hark back to the band's earlier work. ""Dead End"" follows suit, but mixes things up with guest vocals from Swedish pop star Lisa Miskovsky. ""Versus Terminus"" provides a blueprint for laying complex guitar melodies on top of hyper-speed drumming; the result is one of the band's most aggressive tracks in years. These thrash metal moments hold the album together, and there are also several tracks that connect the band's various previous styles effectively. ""Our Infinite Struggle"" is the strongest of these, with its sickeningly heavy lead riff and agony- filled vocals. The instrumental bridge in the middle of the song is-- dare I say-- pretty, but the overall effect is a perfect blend of melody and aggression. Unfortunately, there are still a handful of slower, more commercial sounding tracks. The title track is problematic at best, layering acoustic guitars with whiny emo-tinged vocals. ""Reflect the Storm"" is generic nu-metal, with the same whiny vocal style and a mid-tempo, muted guitar line that offers little to get excited about. Come Clarity is not a return of the classic In Flames sound, but it reclaims much of their earlier glory. Metal bands have an unfortunate history with altering their sound in an attempt to broaden their audience, only to return to some neutered version of their earlier selves once the crowds dwindle. But where so many have failed, In Flames has succeeded. It's as if the years they've spent evolving were merely the process, and Come Clarity is the melodic, head-banging result.","Slight return to form combines death metal's speed and vocals, powerful guitar harmonies and melodies, and rapid time changes.

Snow Borne Sorrow,Nine Horses,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98d13d197565213ae96/1:1/w_160/533bbd32.jpg,2006-02-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5925-snow-borne-sorrow/,Samadhi Sound,"It takes work to hear anxiety in David Sylvian's voice. The impressive baritone from his 1980s Japan and solo albums has matured and strengthened over the years, and it carries the drama in his lyrics with ever more subtlety. For 2003's Blemish-- arguably the strongest, but not the easiest record in his catalog-- Sylvian spent a short six weeks writing and recording material about the dissolution of his marriage, and his voice stands against tense, cold backdrops. The turmoil doesn't shake his performance, which is loud and unyielding, but the hurt comes through in the mix: upfront and naked, he sounds completely alone. Against that bombshell, Snow Borne Sorrow is a far easier listen, and yet it explores some common themes, and serves as a companion to that other work. Both albums reflect the state of the war-torn world, and the crisis in his personal life-- discussed explicitly in his latest record's title track-- and on both albums, his voice sounds strong, clear, and emotionally spent. But where Blemish reacts to the moment, Snow Borne Sorrow sounds like a series of morning-after ruminations. The record combines songs that Sylvian wrote up to five years ago with his brother and long-time collaborator, drummer Steve Jansen, with newer material that he developed with electronica artist Burnt Friedman. (Sylvian released this under the band name Nine Horses probably to share the credit, but at the end of the day it's his show.) But in spite of its long history, Snow Borne Sorrow is consistent, cohesive, and polished to a shine. The trip-hoppy opener ""Wonderful World"", and a new, urgent mix of his and Friedman's enigmatic ""The Librarian"", bookend a record of mid-tempo, contemporary pop songs. Smooth backup singers join Sylvian on several cuts, including the exquisite ""Atom and Cell""; but Stina Nordenstem also makes a striking cameo, creeping into ""Wonderful World"" like a high-pitched ghost and slipping cracks and uncertainty into Sylvian's façade. Ryuichi Sakamoto plays piano with the delicacy of a heavy man walking on ice, and Arve Henriksen, best known as a member of Supersilent, follows Jon Hassell, Kenny Wheeler, and Mark Isham as the latest great trumpeter to work with Sylvian. With a wavering, airy tone that's tastefully exotic in the background, yet precise and determined when he solos, Henriksen fits right in with the ambience and the emotional tenor of the record; you couldn't ask for a better sideman for such a slow, sad album. Sylvian's last ""pop"" record, 1999's Dead Bees on a Cake, was happier and more eclectic, but it was also far more disjointed; his next solo album-- already in progress, though who knows when he'll finish it-- will continue in Blemish's footsteps, stripping away the songforms and other conventions and employing artists like Fennesz and AMM's Keith Rowe. Snow Borne Sorrow would seem to mark a clean end to one phase of his work, while Blemish introduces the next: it'll be more experimental, and maybe more difficult, but if that indomitable voice has made it this far, you know it'll just be back stronger the next time.","David Sylvian follows his excellent Blemish with an album that, likes its predecessor, reflects the state of the war-torn world and the crisis in its creator's personal life.

Johnny Boy,Johnny Boy,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb57eb335119a49ec9fb/1:1/w_160/2ea959ab.jpg,2006-02-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4366-johnny-boy/,Wild Kingdom,"Here's a theory: For a genre to legitimize itself, it needs to have more than just good artists; you also need bad or mediocre ones to provide contrast. In the still embryonic field of indie rock-dance, we've been blessed with an early run of quality bands, like Love Is All, The Go! Team, and United State of Electronica. Taking inspiration from primary dance sources like Daft Punk and the Avalanches rather than the already rock-filtered sound of Gang of Four or Happy Mondays, these groups have kept the indie kids from regressing to crossed-arms days, opening up new avenues of high-energy questionable-fi genre scrapbooks along the way. With 2004's ""You Are the Generation Who Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"", British duo Johnny Boy made a strong argument for inclusion in that upper echelon of call-it-what-you-will. Well received by critics-- even the ones that don't get paid by the word-- ""Generation"" hit the perfect balance between the epic and the homemade: the ""Be My Baby"" drums, the TASCAM Wall of Sound, the exuberant yell-along climax. No small accomplishment to make one of the decade-so-far's best singles on the first try, but the qualifying test of whether the band could stretch the promise of ""Generation"" across an LP frame still loomed large. Sadly, the rest of Johnny Boy never matches the brilliance of ""Generation"", which bats leadoff and provides the record's immediate peak. Playing the genre mix-and-match angle may seem like an easy task, merely requiring a mastery of the unexpected juxtaposition, but unless the approach is meticulously assembled, like the Polaroid pastiches of the Go! Team, it can come out as a malformed mess. Besides a few notable and promising exceptions, unfortunate or over-busy chimeras are largely what Johnny Boy deals out here, collages that assemble their way out of emotional range. ""Bonnie Parker's 115th Dream"" is the easiest target, a junkyard of ""I Want Candy"" drums, sax squeals emulating DJ scratches, rapping 101, incongruous sample breaks, noir horns, and a happy-chant chorus. Songs slum through half-hearted stabs at jazzy noir (""Wall Street"") or snotty punk (""Formaldehyde"") seemingly just because they can, while breakbeats and horn parts turn up in places that don't seem so much carefully chosen as opportunities to vacantly ""weird"" up the proceedings. Some of these genre excursions may have been more successful were it not for the limited range of primary singer Lolly, whose sweet Claudia Gonson-like voice fit snugly within the Lo-town of ""Generation"", but finds itself overextended trying to Beth Gibbons her way through the trip-hoppier parts or keep the sugar-pop of ""Livin' in the City"" from becoming too shrill. It's not until the album-closing ""Johnny Boy Theme"", also previously released, that the band regains its footing, intercutting girl-group sighs with clattering breaks and sleigh-bell fringe, while finally using the good old boy-girl vocal interplay between Lolly and partner Davo to full effect. Between the goalposts of the two already familiar highlights, the missteps of Johnny Boy's debut draw attention to the relative successes of their peers: the way U.S.E. flirts with but avoids S Club 7 cavities, the way Ian Parton's vinyl-raiding symphonies for the Go! Team articulate diversity without sacrificing cohesion. Here, Johnny Boy show themselves to be, at this point, primarily a singles act, which may eventually not be a slight in the still-evolving world of dance-friendly indie/indie-friendly dance, but which, for now, means they don't quite measure up to the competition.","Londoners aim to build on their exceptional ""You Are the Generation..."" single with a record of politically informed indie pop.

Destroy Rock and Roll,Mylo,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c377eb335119a49ed6fb/1:1/w_160/ca9f7999.jpg,2006-02-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5676-destroy-rock-and-roll/,RCA,"Isn't this fun: Destroy Rock and Roll, the first full-length album from Scotland's Myles Macinnes, is just now available in the United States, along with a trio of inessential bonuses. Those of you who are already familiar with Mylo-- dance-music enthusiasts, British people-- are probably over it already: The singles from this LP have been commercial staples since their original vinyl releases, absolute sure shots for making people happy. Plenty of folks have already completed the process of loving them, getting tired of hearing them all the time, and then filing them away as classics. Lucky for those of you who haven't had that experience yet, there are reasons for the rush: This music packs the same exuberant gut-level joy as Daft Punk's ""One More Time"", Basement Jaxx's ""Romeo"", and Outkast's ""Hey Ya"". Only, well, even easier than that. Mylo is like a dance-music Ramones: What he does isn't very complicated. Technically, he's not even very good at it. But that's all just part of the treat. The title's misleading: Nothing gets destroyed here, and there's hardly a rough noise across this hour of music. Destroy Rock and Roll is electronic dance music, pure and simple. Mylo's tracks read a bit like a cross section of the genre's history. All the happiest tricks of each era-- disco groove, synth-pop melodies, house rush, downtempo foot-tapping, French filter sweeps, cut-rate Daft Punk, choppy edits-- sharing space. And yet this is anything but one of those big, bursting pastiche albums, packed with ideas and flailing everywhere at once. No, these tracks go in straight, simple lines, and they rarely take their eyes off whichever hooks grab you fastest. Don't count on the dance cognoscenti to approve of them: If anything, this is house music as Saturday-morning cartoon-- all bold lines inked in bright, primary colors. That simplicity-- Dance Music for Dummies-- is a big part of what lets this collection feel so solid. From ""Muscle Cars"" to its terrific vocal reprise, tracks 3 through 11, just about every song is straight-ahead for-your-pleasure, clocking in under four minutes and hitting like a single straight through. The biggest, simplest treat is ""Drop the Pressure"", a bouncy cartoon-funk bassline paired with a thrilling vocoder freakout. The former's just Daft Punk circa Homework, and the latter's just Daft Punk circa Discovery, but you still can't help smiling when the vocal hook-- ""Motherfucker's gonna drop the pressure""-- starts skipping up octaves and breaking down the vulgar bit. The other tracks pick specific dance vibes and play them up in the most charmingly obvious ways. ""In My Arms"" is slinky 80s pop emotion, complete with ""Bette Davis Eyes"" sample. ""Guilty of Love"" is synthpop too naïve and cheery for 90% of dancefloors on Earth, which Mylo seems too happy to care about. ""Paris Four Hundred"" does the obligatory neon-lit Autobahn-cruising stuff; ""Rikki"" tries stuttering house cut-up like Akufen (or Todd Edwards). And as much as every one of these things comes across like a coloring book next to an oil painting, that's exactly what gives this record its dreamy charm-- even during its tamer lead-ups, which run Röyksopp, trip-hop, and Air through similar homemade Platonic-essence filters. And questions about how effective this kind of simplification can really be get answered by a one-two punch: ""Otto's Journey"", bouncing like nuts around wet, flickering synths, and the vocal cut of ""Muscle Cars"", which is as sleek, sexy, and quaintly unhip as its namesake. There isn't much in here that could be considered hip, or that shows technical skill. But there's a total gut-level joy, as if these were tracks made by an ecstatic, well-meaning kid who hadn't yet encountered the complicated concerns of the places people might actually dance to them. This is to dance what Art Brut is to rock: cheeky, charming, too straightforward to worry about style, ramming through the fundamentals as if pure enthusiasm is the most important part of making music.","More than a year after sweeping Europe, this charming, cheeky dance record-- house music as Saturday-morning cartoon, all bold lines inked in bright, primary colors-- finally gets its U.S. release.

Free in the Streets,A.R.E. Weapons,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fab1335d7bf1698144/1:1/w_160/76486001.jpg,2006-02-13 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/283-free-in-the-streets/,Defend Music,"If emo and New York fashion rock are as ideologically opposed as red and blue states-- weepy strings vs. buzzsaw guitars, maudlin lyrics vs. cynical ones, introspective sensitivity vs. extroverted cool-- then A.R.E. Weapons' sophomore LP attempts to be a bridge between the two. The band haven't abandoned the nihilistic front on which they made their name: tinny bounce beats ripe for a Jeezy or Weezy ad-lib still fart away under sewer-rock guitars, although this time around they've added a human drummer for a more credible thump. And Brain McPeck's smarmy vocals are still peppered with aggressively superficial lyrics that seem like tacit rebukes to anyone who's ever felt anything-- the throbbing dirge ""Doghouse"" is an ode to unfounded self-satisfaction; the Suicide-lite creep-out ""Push 'Em Back"" revolves frivolously around that time-honored cheer; the 8-bit pulse of ""Who Rules the Wasteland?"" continues to conflate NY nightlife with a weird Mad Maxian vision of post-apocalyptic turf wars. The music is better this time around-- the guitars cut harder and deeper, and occasional Rapturous harmonies glam up McPeck's unctuous sneer. But more interesting is how throughout the record, a kinder, gentler (or at least more conflicted about being privileged and shallow) A.R.E. Weapons asserts itself, and despite the hokey context of these glints of humanity, they scan as weirdly sincere. On a serious note, I won't speculate as to whether or not the death of their original guitar player made them take a long, hard look at their essentially cheap take on existence, except to throw it out there as a possibility. On an unserious one, maybe seeing his sister in The Brown Bunny shook something loose in Paul Sevigny's soul, something that rippled out through the band at large. Or maybe it's just another layer of irony, although there are no cues to indicate anything of the sort. I can't call it. Maybe someone just fell in love. The record opens with ""These Tears"", where, over a nervous plink and crashing guitars, McPeck begins with his usual snottiness: ""All my life you know I've been so cold/ I never shed a tear."" It's surprising when the bluster suddenly turns to insecurity-- ""Dear God what is wrong with me?/ Am I really this dead inside?""-- and even more so when the insecurity turns into bald-faced empathy. McPeck cries for ""the days that [his] heart was black,"" for ""the people [he] threw away,"" for ""the crimes of history,"" for ""people feeling all alone."" Has he actually realized that being poor and disenfranchised isn't very funny? This isn't an isolated incident; time and again the mask of alienation slips to reveal a human being who believes that ""everybody needs somebody"" (on ""F.K.F."") and that ""We fuck up sometimes but in the end we know what to do/ We take each other hand in hand/ Walk off into the night"" (on ""Into the Night""). Just so we're clear, this is still extremely bombastic, ridiculous music, and if you're one of the many people who walked out halfway through Electric 6, you probably don't want to bother checking out Electric 7. But by comparison, A.R.E. Weapons is practically elegant, and if their newfound sensitivity is a put-on, it's at least a convincing one.","Paul Sevigny and co. follows their much-hyped debut with, for better or worse, a more mature second effort.

No Word From Tom,Hem,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1685e6ef959693236d5/1:1/w_160/ba59e5ac.jpg,2006-02-13 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3995-no-word-from-tom/,NettwerkWaveland,"By now it's a cliché to say that odds-and-sods collections are cause for diminished expectations. Ostensibly the songs weren't good enough for proper albums, so consistency and cohesion of theme or sound are usually sacrificed in favor of a catchall organization and stunt covers. This type of release is widely regarded as a means to keep fans interested for another year or two (""stopgap"" is a common descriptor), maybe to make a few bucks off recordings that are just collecting dust anyway, and at the very least to give some insight into the artists' creative process and live show. But sometimes the cliché rings perfectly true, as in the case of Hem's new odds-and-sods collection, enticingly titled No Word From Tom. Featuring demos, live cuts, covers, alternate takes, and non-album tracks, this compilation could be the epitome of this type of release, with all the predictable merits and flaws. So what, then, does No Word From Tom tell us about Hem? Well, for starters, that they're more adventurous than their polite sound usually suggests, and that their songs are never really finished, but just packets of future possibilities, easily rearranged and retooled. Several songs here are alternate versions of album tracks, with new instrumentation or arrangements revised for live settings. This version of the instrumental ""Eveningland"", from the 2004 album of the same name, sprawls out to showcase soundtrack-ready orchestration and atmosphere, and Hem add two sets of lyrics to that same album's ""Cincinnati Traveler""-- one with impressionistic imagery about the Civil War, the other with lyrics ""misheard"" from the previous version. The best tracks on No Word From Tom are the outtakes from those album sessions-- most notably ""The Present"" and ""Oh No""-- which sound like finished products. The live tracks, on the other hand, are hit or miss. ""Betting on Trains"" possesses a languid directness that makes Sally Ellyson's vocals on the chorus all the more startling, and ""Sailor"" nicely translates the Rabbit Songs original's orchestral arrangements to a stage setting without losing any of its balanced fullness. But where ""Idle"" should be a show-closing powerhouse, instead it falls short: Despite Dan Messé's descending piano trills, the song feels a little stunted in this new arrangement, implying the potential for folksy drama without actually achieving it. The applause feels only polite. Perhaps the biggest draw for No Word From Tom will be the covers. Generally, the older the original, the better it sounds in Hemland. Tony Joe White's ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" is just as its title suggests: a patiently paced country ballad about wasting time with a grieving heart, it retains all its drowsy power in this setting. And ""Tennessee Waltz"", a live staple of Hem shows, is a lowly lament, its waltz tempo muted for maximum heartache. But neither Fountains of Wayne nor R.E.M. translates very naturally to the band's unhurried sound: The former's ""Radiation Vibe"" is so slow it lacks any vibe at all, and the latter's ""So. Central Rain"" drains the original of its Southern mystery. So these tracks tell us that Hem aren't always the best judge of cover material, but maybe the adventurous attempt is all that matters-- at least on a release like this.","Odds-and-sods collection includes demos, live cuts, covers, alternate takes, and non-album tracks.

Scalpel Slice,Gerry MitchellLittle Sparta,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c376ea9e61561daa7f12/1:1/w_160/2d0a7528.jpg,2006-02-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5675-scalpel-slice/,Fire,"I'm still searching for the best way to drop the phrase ""spoken-word"" without sending potential readers running, because this collaborative mini-album between photographer-cum-poet Gerry Mitchell and the band Little Sparta dodges any stigma the tag might carry. For one, Little Sparta-- who craft a quaint rustic-yet-dark feel from acoustic guitar, violin, harmonium, drums, and enough minor-key preciousness to soundtrack a stop-motion Tim Burton feature-- would have no trouble carrying a record by themselves. In some instances here they hint at what a Little Sparta record would sound like: Mitchell's muttered, cryptic rhymes and can barely be heard above the opener ""Scalpel Slice"", and he's not present on two instrumentals, ""Ruins"" or ""I See Life"", where the band digs deepest into its capabilities for melody and atmosphere. But yes, this can't be called speak-singing, just talk-talking; Mitchell is reciting full-blown poetry over Little Sparta's instrumentals. It would make for an odd reading unaccompanied, though. Listen to ""Mocking Mirror"", where his genial, welcoming voice turns into a convulsion as he barely spits out the words the word ""moon,"" then starts over from the beginning, like a fireside chat from an infirmed uncle or a beguiling old stranger in a hostel or a café. It's a strange touch that would only work on an album, creating the feeling of narration without any real narrative, just a few repeated lines in a thick Scottish accent and thicker tones of regret. Things start to shift with ""Skyscraper Housebound"". The band plays more repetitive figures, and Mitchell's placement of the words becomes conscious of the music, waiting his turn for the harmonium to finish its brief interjection before chiming in. It feels like an informal gathering of quick learners, trading off one another and slowly giving each other the proper space. On ""Carefully Constructed Ruin"", the band steps back into almost total ambience, a terse, wheezing drone behind Mitchell's most emotional moment on the record. The track with the greatest symbiosis is also the strangest. ""Even the Saints"" has Mitchell shouting just one syllable with every slow, staccato downbeat: he shouts, Eve!...En!...The!...Saints!...Don't!...Like!...It!... Here...!"" (you get the idea) until, finally, he ends the track by restating, in the flattest tone possible, ""No, really; It seems to be seems broken, or at least all fucked up, and I'm embarrassed by my efforts to survive here."" That last line may deflate the track's tension, but it also underlines the bittersweet and unpretentious territory they explore. Even if they're only truly together on the final track, these collaborators feed off of each other in strange ways, with an edge that keeps this from just poetry set to music. Neither Mitchell nor Little Sparta wants the limelight, and the record is better for it.","Collaborative mini-album between photographer-cum-poet Gerry Mitchell and the rustic-yet-dark band Little Sparta.

Black Magic Show,Elefant,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce15e6ef95969322f39/1:1/w_160/ac9eccff.gif,2006-02-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2891-black-magic-show/,HollywoodKemado,"Gentlemen of the jury who still just can't get enough '80s nostalgia, I give you Elefant. On 2003's Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid, the New York foursome passably reprised the dreary disdain of then newly re-trendy influences like the Cure, the Smiths, the Psychedelic Furs, and Joy Division, with faint glances shoeward. Since then, they've teamed with Disney subsidiary Hollywood, which affords them the considerable services of producer Don Gilmore (Dashboard Confessional, Linkin Park, and Duran Duran-- on their 2004 reunion flop). Black Magic Show is more obvious than its already duh predecessor, but otherwise differs only in gorgeous frontman Diego Garcia's apparent discoveries of gothic musical theater and Russian expat literature. Elefant's latest is only as deep as its clenched-jaw fake-Brit hooks. The catchiest, ""It's a Shame"", turns out to be a jangles-on-ice ""Lovesong"" rip, or ri-hi-hip-- Garcia likes to Mozzify. Garcia doesn't exactly earn the showstopper key change closing ""The Clown""-- let alone the Harold Faltermeyer guitar wank-- repeating couplets that rhyme 'cause they hafta. ""It's just a way/ A way that we play,"" he offers, or elsewhere, ""The first time was the worst/ Now I thirst."" NYC applause lines jut from ""The Lunatic"", which despite the portentous title possesses a boringly post-9/11 mindset: ""Manhattan are you up or down?/ Manhattan are you still around?"" Good thing Mickey Mouse is stingy, 'cause the only thing worse than the fake strings on cruise-control love ballad ""Why"" would be real strings. Sometimes, as Borges wrote, a show within a show raises the possibility that we, too, are fictitious, but here as in most post-Sgt. Pepper's pop it signals a band's futile fumbling for significance. Introducing this Show, the theatrical title track sets a vaguely Eastern European rhythm to non sequiturs about devils and kings that almost suggest a storyline. ""The freaks have come out tonight,"" Garcia warns more typically, adding, ""There's no difference between wrong and right."" A similarly predictable melodrama pervades reverso-Louis-XIV groupie lament ""Brasil"" and eyes-red, flowers-dead ""My Apology"". Michael Crawford never suffered a chorus like this: ""You're killing me with your eyes/ You're killing me with your lies."" Then there's first single ""Lolita"", bane of my existence, tepid scourge of my tired ears. Lo. Lee. Ta. Yes, it's about that Dolores Haze, the cynical nymphet so well-loved and ill-used by one Humbert Humbert. But even kids who don't know Nabokov like this detective guitar jigsaw better on ""Hash Pipe"" or, shudder, ""Juicebox"". They, too, will grimace at the song's empty-headed apex: ""I shout out loud, Lolita/ You are my heart and soul!"" Garcia should've just plagiarized-- assuming he read the book.","Former NYC buzzband offers a digital release of its sophomore album roughly two months before it's available in stores.

I Am the Resurrection: A Tribute to John Fahey,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1fabf31b7dc7155e8e/1:1/w_160/8e2cf290.jpg,2006-02-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2948-i-am-the-resurrection-a-tribute-to-john-fahey/,Vanguard,"Five years after his death, John Fahey continues to loom large over the underground landscape-- and not solely through his legendary work as a musician. Inquisitive listeners also draw benefits from Fahey's activities as a record collector, music historian, and label operator via the ongoing works of his Revenant imprint and the numerous archival labels it has inspired. Yet oddly, these projects-- coupled with Fahey's truly breathtaking virtuosity as a guitarist-- have often served to obscure his significance as an innovative American composer. It's this curious imbalance that co-producers M. Ward and Stephen Brower clearly intend to address with I Am the Resurrection, a collection that features 13 current indie folk/rock acts paying homage to Fahey and his brilliant, eccentric creations. As a composer, Fahey's initial source material was the primitive folk and blues culled from his vast collection of vintage 78s. But his distinctive style rapidly expanded to reference Bartok, Indian ragas, Gershwin, musique concréte, and whatever else happened to attract his voracious curiosity. And as with many such 20th century innovators, Fahey's true genius was in making his wild stylistic unions seem not only organic and logical but virtually inevitable. However, his intricate compositions do pose unique challenges for the covering artist, primarily because there are so few guitarists who possess the technical ability to faithfully interpret his work. Nevertheless, I Am the Resurrection is resolutely a guitar players' album, with 12 of its 13 tracks centered upon Fahey's main instrument. (Only Howe Gelb has the horse sense to transpose the ragtime of ""My Grandfather's Clock"" to an upright piano, noting astutely that Fahey played guitar like a piano player.) In addition, the collection possesses an air of reverent nostalgia that likely would've irritated Fahey to no end. Nearly all of the songs gathered here originate from his classic 60s Takoma albums, ignoring the more dissonant, abstract material of his later years almost entirely. Thankfully, the album includes appearances by some of Fahey's most gifted acolytes. Peter Case acquits himself nicely on his solo acoustic version of ""When the Catfish Is in Bloom"", in the set's most fearlessly literal interpretation. Guitarist Jack Rose, playing here with his trio Pelt, contributes a dazzling take on ""Sunflower River Blues"", a piece that also appeared on Rose's 2005 album Kensington Blues. Cul De Sac deliver a reprise as well, offering a 1997 live version of ""The Portland Cement Factory at Monolith, CA"" from their debut album, with Robin Amos adding concussive electronic effects to Jones' immaculate guitar arpeggios. Lovely as these two pieces are, attentive fans might wish that Rose and Jones had instead taken a new crack at alternate works from the Fahey catalog. Considerably less successful is Sufjan Stevens, whose typically fussy arrangements prove an ill match for the contours of Fahey's ""Commemorative Transfiguration & Communion at Magruder Park"". In his original version, Fahey incorporated portions of the traditional hymn ""All Creatures of Our God and King"", and here Stevens has reversed the process, ignoring Fahey's song as much as possible to focus on the hymn, torpidly stalling the album's quiet momentum. Likewise, M. Ward's electric rendition of ""Bean Vine Blues No. 2"" here falls completely flat. A slight tune that Ward claims to have selected for its sense of humor, it's a track that in this context appears decidedly frivolous and perfunctory. Elsewhere on the album, Calexico do an admirable job on ""Dance of Death"" by adding upright bass and marimba to enhance the melody's simmering core. And Devendra Banhart submits a slow, thoughtful version of the exquisite ""Sligo River Blues"", getting his performance across with fervent passion rather than pristine chops. Though Lee Ranaldo does mutely acknowledge Fahey's late-90s work with the impressionistic ""The Singing Bridge of Memphis, Tennessee (Brooklyn Bridge Version: The Coelcanth)"" one wishes that the compilation's architects had roamed further afield to include more experimental, non-American, or non-idiomatic voices. Such an approach would've been a truer representation of the scope of Fahey's work, and perhaps a better indicator of his actual influence. As it is, the best that can be said of I Am the Resurrection is that it makes one want to go spend some serious hours listening to John Fahey records-- an accomplishment that might be tribute enough in itself.","Co-organized by M. Ward, this 13-track collection pays homage to the folk legend and his brilliant, eccentric creations, and features contributions from Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart, and Jack Rose among others.

Silent Shout,The Knife,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc40eb335119a49ecc09/1:1/w_160/ac002cfb.jpg,2006-02-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/,MuteRabid,"One of the prevailing critical talking points surrounding the release of Radiohead's Kid A had to do with Thom Yorke's willful defilement of his own vocals. Remember the reactions? Those desperate for the band to remain in the golden-throated glory days of The Bends puzzled over the move before ultimately chalking it up to a function of Yorke's inscrutable eccentricity; others cited interviews in which Yorke professed to be sick of his own voice as proof there was a more sympathetic method to his madness. But despite all the peripheral talk about the band's blossoming love of electronic and experimental music, few critics advanced the simplest theory, which was that Radiohead had completely succumbed to its own lust for the textures of dance music. No wonder those vocals had to go. Vocal-fronted acts in dance and electronic music have tangled for years with how to rectify the textural freshness afforded by synths, samplers, and computers with the relative milque-toastiness of the human voice. The disco/house solution has been to lubricate vocals with a glossy coating of filters and vocoders; electro's has been to marry cold, bristly analogs with deadpan vocal affect; IDM's has been to chop, slice, and dice; and a number of general purpose dance acts have decided that multiplicity (by way of an endless procession of guest vocalists) is the key to staying energized. That said, only a handful of electronic full-lengths have navigated the vocal/textural divide as inventively as and refreshingly as Kid A. The latest is Silent Shout. The brainchild of Swedish siblings Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer Andersson, the Knife have released three records, each an exponential improvement over the last. Although the last, 2004's Deep Cuts, boasted the shimmering ""Heartbeats""-- a sort of ""99 Luftballons"" for the techno set, since covered by up-and-coming indie darling José Gonzalez-- it was also something of a mess, spitting up steel drum samples, happy hardcore breaks, and innocuous synthpop riffs. A much tighter, laser-guided record, Silent Shout finds the duo honing in on a specific mood, and at last, perfecting a signature sound. As evidenced by the Chris Cunningham-esque creature adorning the promotional material and artwork of the album's debut single, the operative adjective here is ""evil."" Along with recent outings from Mu and Cristian Vogel, Silent Shout achieves a forbidding cold-bloodedness by melding contemporary electronic sounds with a grotesque vocal palette. Call it ""haunted house."" As menacing as it is hooky, this is some bracing stuff. It helps that Dreijer's arrangements have become more assured and refined over time-- from the rushing percussion and synth flares of ""Neverland"" to the hall of plexiglass mirrors wonkiness of ""We Share Our Mother's Health"", he frequently finds a striking balance between minimalism and dissonance. But, as alluded above, Andersson's vocals do the bulk of the work. With ""Heartbeats""-- not to mention her guest spot on Röyksopp's slept-on ""What Else Is There""-- she proved that her shrill voice (think Björk by way of Ari Up by way of Siouxsie Sioux by way of Mu's Mutsumi Kanamori) was capable of magic in its natural form, but little of Silent Shout grants us that pleasure. Here, her vocals are almost always multi-tracked, with at least one of those tracks run through a pitch shifter or octave filter or something similar, usually to genuinely creepy result. On the record's eponymous horrorshow opener, she sounds like she's duetting with Zuul; ""The Captain"" runs her vocal through an exciter and pitch-shifts it up to mimic the Oriental scale; ""Still Light"" has her singing feebly into a ceiling fan from a hospital bed; and ""One Hit"" is possibly the only song in the world that could be reasonably classed ""goblin glam"" (note: that means it's great). An early contender for best record of the quarter, here's hoping Silent Shout inspires similar imagination and pushing outwards; after all, no matter how heady and interior electronic music allows itself to become, it could never get as scary as the world outside. ","Ditching the springy Europop of 2004's Deep Cuts, Sweden's the Knife here pits dark, ghostly electro backdrops against elastic vocals, which they mash through a wringer of digital manipulation. A far cry from the duo's friendly first singles, Silent Shout gorily births the Knife's mutant twin. The result is creepy enough to warrant its own genre: haunted house.

Vampire Circus,Earthride,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd12eb335119a49ecdd2/1:1/w_160/055ce7c9.jpg,2006-02-12 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2936-vampire-circus/,Southern Lord,"Rumor has it, Leviathan singer Wrest has coined a term-- ""Nigel hipster,"" nigel for short-- to describe the metal carpetbaggers who fill out the ranks at Southern Lord shows. One thing metal is typically not, whether black-, death-, doom-, drone-, or otherwise, is ironic; cut-off t-shirts and unwashed longhair on good lookin' Brooklynites qualifies, which is why Nachtmystium vocalist Azentrius was giving it to the good folks at Northsix before SunnO))) took the stage back in December. That said, I saw a reunited Grief play to about 25 people in the Knit basement that same fall, and when Earthride gets back to New York, figure something similar. Reason being: Earthride have zero charisma, little charm, and almost no non-hessian hooks; this, oddly enough, I think puts them at metal's new (old) non-avant frontier. Earthride certainly have the pedigree for it-- singer Dave Sherman did time in the well-liked Maryland doom outfit Spirit Caravan, and Vampire Circus was mostly recorded by Mike Dean, of the legendary Corrosion of Conformity and Probot. Neither aggressively slow nor aggressively fast, Earthride does a weedburning, mid-tempo cheesy riffs and lyrics thing; actually, what it really is, is rock and roll. ""PURE MARYLAND DOOM FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF MUSIC,"" as the slogan goes, and you might laugh at the whiskey vocals and 4/4 open snares and bluesed solos. Me though, I still like ""Dirtnap"": ""There's no solace for the ignorance of man/ There's no politicians gonna tell me where I stand/ Fuck no,"" even if I'm pretty sure that ""skin the cat"" also appears as lyric, rhymed, gulp, with ""Dirt. Nap."" That song unfolds loose bar-rock soloed notes after tight repetitive chordings; to this, I play air guitar. Dave Sherman sounds (a lot) like Lemmy; the closer here is called ""Swamp Witch"", which has vocoder FX and organs courtesy of Clutch (gulp) keyboardist Mike Schauer. I'd be ironically laughing (or am, sort of) if I wasn't lifted on ""Vampire Circus""'s lip-pursing doomy forecasts about the ""nature of an endless beast."" The absurdly limited-edition records doomish metal specializes in (free record reviews for that Noothgrush/Sloth split!) suggest that these dudes are not always out for numbers-- even if the contract does say Southern Lord-- and I'll bet Earthride doesn't spend much time envying High on Fire before they pass out on their swagged-up shag carpet. Vampire Circus never stops eying the prize, something you couldn't say about, say, the new Earth, so pick whichever one doesn't bore you.","Weedburning, mid-tempo riffs from this Southern Lord metal band.

With a personality that lies somewhere between back-of-the-class snark machine and overeducated carnival barker, P.O.S. is the unmitigated star of this crew. He's slick with his verbs and an electric, engaging performer, but he lacks a certain perceptibility. Audition is P.O.S.'s second album and his goals seem dignified: Cull punk's fiery abrasions and mesh it with the continually refined, authentically emotive hip-hop that's been billowing out of Minnesota for some time. This goal is all but impossible. His version of punk's manic, enraged tension-- essentially its spine-- is antithetical to the downy grooves that propelled Slug to pinup status. If recent Rhymesayers history has taught us anything, the more aggressive the Atmosphere song, the more grating. That's clear on the jazzy ""Bush-League Psych-Out Stuff"", which features Slug intoning his quasi-famous ""Gimme a pound or a hug"" mantra in opposition to P.O.S.'s angry young man steez. He's right to mess with guitar fractals and unsteady bass, there's not enough sophisticated intermingling going on in the underground right now. But against a cool, effortless Slug, P.O.S. sounds like a guy tugging on shirt tails. ""Half Cocked Concepts"" opens Audition with the sort of propulsive, shouted chorus and saw-toothed guitars that terrify most dyed-in-the-Air Forces rap fans. It's a trick. Most of the joints after that are more accessible, but his challenge to the audience is obvious: ""Brace your bowels, this won't be easy, I'm not an easy artist and I don't rap about blunts, broads, bitches, bras, menage-a-trois, or sex in expensive cars."" ""Stand Up"" recalls the best, loudest part's of Rjd2's ""The Horror"" and gets closest to his agit-prop propers when he sneers, ""We keep our hands warm with the damn Patriot Act."" Greg Attonito, lead singer of pop-punk progenitors Bouncing Souls, joins P.O.S. for a soaring chorus on the autobiographical ""De La Souls"". The album's most distinctly hip-hop track, it's built on solemn cello and crackling snares, and offers relationship drama (""I can safely say I've never played a woman without Karma catching up"") and family death and metaphorical tangle (""By the time I catch an apple, usually it's rind""). ""Paul Kersey to Jack Kimball"" sees P.O.S. emulating Eminem's gruff, distressed growl, coupled with spare, empty bathroom horror. ""P.O.S. Is Ruining My Life"" is the album's centerpiece but it grossly reverts to Staind-style indulgence, practically demanding raised cell phones and LOVE-HATE tattoos on your fists. And much has been made of Hold Steady lead singer Craig Finn's ""Predator""-dissing appearance on ""Safety in Speed (Heavy Metal)"". The track, downbeat and ethereal, isn't anything special and the political imagery is murky at best. Finn's attempts at adroit observation are courageous but imprecise. Here, like elsewhere, P.O.S. makes reckoning a certainty.

We've,Christina Carter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7305e6ef95969320efb/1:1/w_160/51b743bf.gif,2006-02-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1799-weve/,Digitalis,"On the surface, Christina Carter's distinctive, free-floating improvisations seem as though they could only be born of solitude and introspection. So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the storied psych-folk combo Charalambides, Carter has also paired with Heather Leigh Murray as Scorces, recorded as a duo with Loren Mazzacane Connors, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit Andrew MacGregor, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first full harvest with the prolonged, disembodied howl of We've. Recorded live at KDVS radio in California, We've consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in Carter's catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of British Columbia, MacGregor's hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with Carter's lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, the duo's fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors. The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as Carter and MacGregor almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. Though the session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, the piece has a profound sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully illuminated against a dark, bottomless expanse. It's unclear if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, and We've seems to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia. Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, MacGregor's guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to Tom Carter's fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in Charalambides. As the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, Derek Bailey-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with Christina Carter's output, We've proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable talents.","Charalambides member delivers another successful psych-folk collaboration-- this time with kindred spirit Andrew MacGregor.

Magnificent City,Aceyalone,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fed5e6ef9596931fe37/1:1/w_160/07c905b8.jpg,2006-02-12 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18-magnificent-city/,Project BlowedDecon,"This should be great. On albums like 1995's All Balls Don't Bounce, Freestyle Fellowship veteran Aceyalone developed an enormously likable rap style, a big-hearted and joyous lope, jumping in and out of beats and letting loose with gooshy, wide-eyed innocence and an effortless flair. For this album, he's teamed with Rjd2, a producer whose work with rappers usually isn't great but whose instrumental work is perhaps the most gorgeous and expansive in underground hip-hop. These guys have both done beautiful things in the past, so it follows that their collaborative effort should be amazing. Well, um, it isn't. Instead, Magnificent City is lazy and inept, devoid of force and inspiration and chemistry. Aceyalone sounds as if the decade-plus he's spent kicking around West Coast backpack-rap has stolen the wonderfully warm playfulness that used to just drip off him. He's become broken, almost cynical. More to the point, he's lost his distinctiveness. These days, he sounds almost exactly like his vastly inferior stylistic descendent Murs; a couple of times, I had to check the tracklisting to make sure I wasn't actually hearing a Murs guest appearance. Many of the songs on Magnificent City fit a pre-established connect-the-dots blueprint: the weed song, the I-want-everything song, the birth narrative. Others have lame, one-note concepts, like ""Supahero"", which, duh, is about how he is not a superhero. He doesn't sound excited to be rapping; his vocals are flatter than ever, and his lines are often painful (""Aceyalone, but you can call me Acey/ I'm a real OG like Count Basie/ Hook up the recipe so nice and tasty/ When I'm done, they screaming out, 'Aceyalone, lace me'""). The best I can say about Acey here is that he raps on-beat. Most of the time. For his part, Rj pulls off a couple of nice tricks, like the strutting horns and chicken-scratch guitars of ""All For U"" and the rolling bass and jingling percussion of ""Caged Bird"". But he's reigned in his tendencies toward big-canvas atmospheric funk, and so his tracks come off sounding pedestrian and unambitious. And when Rj blows it, as with the faux-Timbaland oscillating synth blips of ""Mooore"", Acey isn't exactly there to pick up the slack. We deserve better from these guys.","Freestyle Fellowship veteran teams his typically likable, big-hearted style with star indie hip-hop producer Rjd2.

Generation,Audio Bullys,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1439d034d5c69bf2905/1:1/w_160/0a5771c6.jpg,2006-02-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/355-generation/,Astralwerks,"Keep your Zelig analogies, I call it Sublime Syndrome. When bands emulate everything they consume, success becomes a matter of taste; all derivatives are not created equal, but some are born of nobler blood. Songs become vibes and everything gets somethingified. The albums that crib most fully and unabashedly testify not as suspects but as witnesses. Sometimes we get School of Rock grads, sometimes card-carrying exoticists. Sublime drank Corona with the dullest deities in both camps, but at least they were candid. The jury appreciated that. Worse than a poor choice of acquaintances is the extrovert's inability-- or unwillingness-- to discern at all. Surveying the 00s British house, garage, and pop schema, Audio Bullys find a lot they like. Too much, in fact. ""You just can't control it,"" claims the title track, apparently referring to Audio Bullys eclecticist impulse. Generation would sit much better if the group focused on something in particular, whether it be ""EQ'ing""'s cartoonish big-beat bash, ""Shot You Down""'s pivotal Nancy Sinatra vocals, or any of the other ideas scattered throughout. Imagine a Since I Left You sans principle and precision. It's okay to artfully muss hair, less so one's vinyl collection. A recent iPod double-bill backing Generation with Ricardo Villalobos's Ascho did not do the Bullys any favors; Villalobos made brothers-in-scratch Tom Dinsdale and Simon Franks look about as subtle as the Bloodhound Gang. But Audio Bullys don't request attention, they irrupt into your headphones like a drunk at a curry house, usually bullhorning pep rally piffle like, ""You are now entering the mode of the Audio Bullys."" Morally palatable as it is to hear a house record not dredged in fairy dust, Generation makes you appreciate ketamine's bottomless suction or space disco's eternal ascent. But Audio Bullys chase Bombay Sapphire, not white rabbits, tracing a pedestrian trajectory: It's all good 'till you puke or someone gets his nose hairs burnt. Generation is a sonic mess, all weightless synth swish, dull beats, and maybe-ironic midi horns. Sample encyclopedias would be able to tag the ubiquitous chordal upbeats ""Bring Light"" hawks for a hook, but the watered-down post-Bangalter vibe comes across regardless. Then there's the rapping, so reliant on DJ phraseology, so devoid of the Skinner-trifles that can endear those clichés, or at least make them sufferable. After Audio Bullys drop lyrical bombs, they light a match. Here's the wanly pneumatic ""Take You There"" to aerosol ""This Road""'s odorous droppings. There's the chummy trumpet call ""Get Myself on Track"", followed by a handful of fail-proof yet tacky love songs. ""Generation"", meanwhile, with its globby lava lamp bassline and chintzy Reason drums, may need a longer soak.

Super Extra Gravity,The Cardigans,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a524ea9e61561daa507f/1:1/w_160/c4e5e037.jpg,2006-02-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1306-super-extra-gravity/,Interscope,"The Cardigans could have been real good to you. Fine, so they never reconfirmed ABBA national stereotypes with more defiantly bubblegum brilliance like 1995's Life or 1996's First Band from the Moon. They just needed their space. Maybe they got it on 1998's electronica-tinged Gran Turismo, but they're not the ones who didn't call after the dulcet pop-rock slickness of 2004's melancholic Long Before Daylight. ""True love is cruel love,"" formerly blond frontwoman Nina Persson sang on that album's brutal ""And Then You Kissed Me"". Turning toward jagged country-rock, sixth album Super Extra Gravity strips the bandages from a 10-year abusive relationship that hasn't been this poker-hot since the early days. It's a reason to keep coming back. Believe it or not, cruelty was always an undercurrent for the Swedish quintet, formed in 1992 over a love of heavy metal and a hardcore past. Self-destruction is the order on first single ""I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer"", as a sultry Persson describes lovers' quarrels that lead straight to ""a glass or 10."" Yo La Tengo guitar squalls intermittently rend smoldering breakup song ""Losing a Friend"". A seductive sadomasochism further informs stomping ""Drip Drop Teardop"" and dark finale ""And Then You Kissed Me II"", which extends its predecessor toward an ironical ""happy end"". On soaring country-waltz ""Overload"", with Spector-reverbed honky-tonk pianos, the pain gives way to even fierier pleasures: ""I'm hot, baby/ Don't burn your fingers."" Religion soon intrudes on the sex, as is its wont. ""Godspell"" recalls Emmylou Harris in condemning all manner of crooks who brandish the Lord as a crutch, but mostly it seethes with hot-blooded guitar and gently accusatory piano. Its whistling mid-song march is just one of many surprises in the album's carefully constructed compositions-- see also the new-wave synth following the straight-ahead ""Dreams""-era Fleetwood Mac verses of ""In the Round"". Steeped in organs, ""Holy Love"" lifts toward an angelic bridge on the strength of bursting bass and what sounds like harpsichord, but ultimately finds love as conflict-filled as ever. ""I can even be nothing if you ask/ I'll turn invisible for you,"" Persson pleads huskily. Despite some gratingly obvious rhymes, ""Good Morning Joan"" is a catchy, faster number even as it rejects any semblance of salvation. Super Extra Gravity is too deft to be too dark, though-- there's joy in its catharsis. ""Sit...good dog!"" begins ""Fine Wine"", as guitar, bass and drums bark in conversation. ""Little Black Cloud"" just wants to dance, and second single ""Don't Blame Your Daughter (Diamonds)"" is a ballad as VH1-ready as anything on Cat Power's recent soccer-mom stab The Greatest, only prettier. These days it seems like every new band is Swedish. But my original Scandinavian love, armed with a newly raw aesthetic, has finally approached the beauty of that long-ago MTV first sight. Hit me baby, one more time.","Swedish group follows its underrated, melancholic Long Before Daylight by turning toward jagged country-rock.

Singles. Period. The Vinyl Years 1980-1990,The Ex,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc5c0084474cd0c2b6b/1:1/w_160/3b7f01dc.jpg,2006-02-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2862-singles-period-the-vinyl-years-1980-1990/,Touch and Go,"When the Ex formed in 1979, the band was more a name spray-painted on the walls of the Netherlands than an actual musical endeavor. It was the punk era, and a complete lack of musical experience didn't seem too great a barrier to overcome. The Ex made swift musical progress, though, and by the time they made their first recordings in 1980, four songs that comprised the self-released 7"" All Corpses Smell the Same, they were a sturdy, rhythmic unit with a good sense of dynamics. It was the start of a prolific run that's now gone on for 27 years, putting them just behind the Fall for extended high achievement by a punk band. Throughout their existence, the Ex have always been steadfastly uncommercial, refusing major label deals and remaining close to the radical politics that fueled them from the beginning. During their first decade, the Ex released a steady stream of albums and peripheral tracks, all on vinyl, and while the full-lengths have all found their way to CD, the numerous flexi-discs, compilation tracks, splits, and 7-inch EPs they put out remain exceedingly rare. Singles. Period. rectifies this situation by compiling all 23 non-album tracks the band recorded from 1980-1990, nicely remastered with pulverizing low-end and liner notes so thorough they take the disc's full 70-minute running time to read. The constants across the disc are Terrie Ex's ablating guitar and G.W. Sok's dry, amelodic vocals, taking on overzealous police raids, Apartheid, the El Salvadoran Civil War, and nuclear power with motor-mouthed rage. Bass players, drummers, and other assorted instrumentalists come and go around them, and the band evolves vividly across the chronologically-arranged disc, taking the agit-funk of the Gang of Four to rougher, nastier extremes and mixing directly with the European radical groups whose causes they espoused. In 1981, they and others squatted a house called Villa Zuid in the small Dutch town of Wormer to prevent it from being torn down, recording the scathing ""Constitutional State"" for a compilation meant to benefit the building, ending with Sok's declamation ""A constitutional state? I guess it's too late."" Years later, ""Rara Rap"" became something of a left-field Dutch hit for the Ex-- the band wrote the song to protest the Dutch government's failure to prevent Dutch businesses from working with South Africa's Apartheid government. In between, the Ex raised money for striking British miners and split a 7"" single with the Kurdish folk band Awara, foreshadowing their collaborations with Eritrean and Congolese musicians more than a decade later. As important as politics are to the story of the Ex, though, there's an impressive musical progression on the disc as well. The early songs are brittle, nominally funky punk tunes with the occasional lead guitar phrase and arid production. By the time they got to 1983's ""Gonna Rob the Sperm Bank"", the Ex had begun to incorporate improvisation and a wider range of timbres into the sound. That song's razor-toned guitar onslaught is underpinned by a nasty, industrial bassline and Sok sounds strangely at home lost in the maelstrom. ""Lied der Steinklopfer"" features a demonic horn arrangement and tape distortion, while Awara's violinist contributes a haunting solo to ""Enough Is Enough"", otherwise a frenzied beast of rhythm with what sounds like two simultaneous basslines crunching and grinding away at the utterly locked-in drums. The hard groove is even more terrifying on ""Long Live the Aged"", and one thing that this disc makes abundantly clear is that, even on their early releases, the Ex were never slack about their playing or arrangements, apparently realizing that if their songs weren't going to be catchy pop tunes, they needed something else for listeners to latch onto. The strategy worked, and there's not a moment here you could call tepid. Even the bad ideas, and there are a few, are executed with intensity and passion and usually yield at least a good drum beat. The Ex recorded some great albums in the 1980s, Pokkeherrie chief among them, but Singles. Period. is the strongest introduction to the band's early work available.","Touch & Go issues a decade's worth of singles from the Dutch punk band.

The Minus 5,The Minus 5,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c554ea9e61561daa81a2/1:1/w_160/ffadfa45.jpg,2006-02-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5321-the-minus-5/,Yep Roc,"Scott McCaughey's guns are deadly. Bleak endings are an obsession for this pop consortium's fearful leader and the loose crew's seventh full-length isn't just nicknamed The Gun Album because of the firearm that graces its cover. Scattered throughout the disc's 13 rounds, McCaughey goes inside the tortured skulls of cryptic, morally challenged characters who contemplate the power of bullets, chambers, murder, and suicide. Time and time again, the quick trigger presents a solution to inner struggle while dire consequences lurk underneath. It's heady stuff which the songwriter chooses to deflate-- for better and worse-- with his obsession with all things '60s and hummable. Accompanied by Minus 5 regulars including Peter Buck and Wilco alongside newbies like Colin Meloy, Gun finds songwriter's songwriter McCaughey slightly stuck in his own unique, nuanced niche. Given the thickening existential angst running through much of McCaughey's material, it's hard to believe the former Young Fresh Fellow is the same man who wrote ""Amy Grant"" back in '87, irreverently musing about the country good-girl (""She just gets rich 'cause she works for God"") over funny funk. Well into his third decade writing biting witticisms alongside all stripes of guitar pop, the singer provokes both heartfelt intrigue and alienating frustration with his current style. Further distancing himself from the punk-pop of his early days, the frizzy-haired ringmaster serves his slickest 60s-sounding recreations yet on Gun with only a few notes bulging out of their Beatle-y boxes. Aside from a couple of especially twangy moments, the sound is a replica of the replicas McCaughey currently loves to churn out, with several songs recalling the Minus 5's 2002 Tweedy-time collabo Down With Wilco. At the center of the songwriter's attack is the peppy on the outside/creepy on the inside trick; listen once and hear a pleasant burst of Beach Boys harmonies and Byrds-y strumming, listen a few times with a lyric sheet and an entirely different, darker beast appears. Used well, this songwriting sleight of hand can yield surprising results but the dichotomy can also stretch songs too far apart as they succumb to toothless, smirking quirk. The boogie-woogie Brian Wilson bop of ""Out There on the Maroon"" and the sunny day bait of ""My Life as a Creep"" can't bridge the gap between their shiny exteriors and black-hole cores. Both tell of dirtbag loners through convoluted abstracts that are too difficult to decipher rewardingly. With little to grab onto lyrically and inexcusably blithe cap-gun pop pushing them along, the songs find McCaughey pulling out all of his toys at once with lots of commotion but no bang. When indie-lit poster boy Colin Meloy takes over vocal duties on ""Cemetery Row W14"", a whimsical pile-on may be expected but, instead, the trenchant track is Gun's surest shot. McCaughey flips his approach with the minor piano chords and weeping slide backing Meloy, who plays clear-eyed naïf reflecting on death's soft cushion. ""Cemetery Row is not such a bad place-- don't you want to go?"" he asks, with a sincerity largely absent throughout the rest of the record. The subject matter is still mighty grim, but the song's idyllic take on the other side offers lively affirmations of anticipation: ""Used to be afraid/ Now we love to fade into the procession."" McCaughey's cagey talents as a songwriter are nearly undeniable. And his erratic aim can still be true when he swaps the happytime-mope medleys for a more carefully calibrated consistency.","Also known as ""The Gun Album"", the Scott McCaughey-centered group's latest features contributions from members of Wilco, R.E.M., and the Decemberists.

Colin Meloy Sings trad. arr. Shirley Collins,Colin Meloy,by: Stephen M.

After releasing an EP of Morrissey covers last year, Colin Meloy has recorded a six-song covers EP of traditional songs originally arranged and recorded by 1960s folk troubadour Shirley Collins, again to tie in with a solo acoustic tour. Collins lacks the cache of Moz, but Meloy's not playing Devendra to her Vashti. Colin Meloy Sings trad. arr. Shirley Collins is no revival attempt; the purpose of this release appears simply to show Meloy's affection for these songs. As if undaunted by the prospect of reinventing well-known songs like ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", he lovingly plays them with a little more humor and a lot more care, and as a result, the EP sounds like more of a direct extension of his day job than a mere tour souvenir. Collins proves ideal to Meloy's treatment: During the 60s and 70s, she drew on traditional English music as well as contemporary folk to create a revered body of work. These six songs are so suited to Meloy's idiom that they rarely sound like covers. While I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend at least checking out her originals, Sings Shirley Collins doesn't require any knowledge of its source material the way Sings Morrissey did. That was a one-note release: Once the novelty of hearing an indie pin-up boy covering the ultimate indie pin-up boy wore off, that EP was archived on the CD rack, a gem for Morrissey and Decemberist completists alike but a curio for everyone else. But ...Sings Shirley Collins has a leg up on its predecessor from the word go: Collins is Meloy's kindred spirit. Her sassy wives, errant wanderers, death-scared sailors, and duplicitous thieves could be the same vengeful mariners and lovelorn barrow boys who inhabit Decemberists songs. Meloy fills these tracks out lovingly, eschewing the austere voice-and-guitar setting of Sings Morrissey for an arsenal of bells, banjo, electric guitar, and plucky percussion. The songs remain spare and the mood intimate, but the music feels less imitative and more inhabited. On opener ""Dance to Your Daddy"", bells ding a soft melody to echo Meloy's vocals, reinforcing the song's evocation of parental tenderness-- an obvious choice for the dad-to-be. ""Charlie"" is a little more upbeat, with a banjo bolstering the jaunty chorus. Carson Ellis, Meloy's girlfriend/partner and the artist behind the Decemberists' distinctive album covers and merchandise, makes a brief appearance as a spirited wife-to-be who throws her suitor's expectations right back at him: ""I will marry you but I won't do your washin' or your cookin',"" she sings, proving a perfect foil-- Cher to Meloy's Sonny. Nothing else is quite as upbeat or as charming as ""Charlie"", as the album takes a slightly darker turn with the death song ""Barbara Allen"" (which Meloy, like Collins, pronounces ""Barb'ry Allen""). A metronomic rimshot and a sharp electric guitar stomp out a death march, as if ticking away life's remaining minutes, while Meloy sings of love and mortality, bending up the end of his lines as Collins did nearly 40 years ago. ""Cherry Tree Carol"" continues that funereal pace, dragging a little. It probably doesn't help that Meloy replaces the burbling church organ of Collins's original with an electric guitar that glides around the song's firmament. As if losing energy, the final two songs are the EP's barest: ""Turpin Hero"" is a cautionary tale of thievery and trickery, and ""I Drew My Ship"" is a short a cappella number that might have worked better as the EP's opener, offering a friendly introduction to Meloy's re-creation of Collins' world. In fact, as well chosen as these songs are for Meloy's vocal range and persona, the sequencing does seem slightly off: Listening to these six tracks, I kept thinking I might rearrange them somehow, but of the many possible iterations of the tracklist, none that I devised seemed any better or worse than the official order. It's a quibbling criticism, but this puzzlement prevents the EP from fully realizing the seemingly ideal combination of singer and source. Nevertheless, Sings Shirley Collins is an enticing addition to what could become a very fruitful series.","Second solo covers EP from the Decemberists leader, this record collects interpretations of traditional folk songs arranged and recorded by 1960s folk troubadour Shirley Collins.

Maybe they could dress as huge cotton swabs, or upright bean bags. Surprisingly sunny and apolitical considering their nostalgia for the man who pounded Stoli in Gorby's shadow, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin are four Missourians who sound like every strummy bunch of white boys from the 1990s who homaged even strummier white boys from the 60s, but damn if their pop chops aren't convincing. The blogger massive has all but boostered them onto the Unsigned Wonder pedestal, and this fuzzily engineered release plays like a loose warm-up, a tribute to their unrusted ""roots"" (er, acts which also happen to be their contemporaries). When SSLYBY deliver a polished product in the future, Broom could be considered ""the Basement mp3s."" Finesse abounds, though. Even the band's egregiousnesses-- the ""bops,"" the ""doots,"" the Elliott Smith graverobberies-- are forgivable due to the ease with which they perform such difficult stunts. On a collection of 10 songs, four heterodes with girls in their titles that flex enough tendon to sidestep tweedom? Check. Dueling vocalists who manage not-entirely-distracting scale-downs of Rivers Cuomo and Conor Oberst? Check, again. Guitarists who pull off coffeehouse restagings of the Shins and Olivia Tremor Control? Tricheckta. Besides, a peak of hypocrisy is accusing someone of stealing music during this gilded age of downloading. (After the coming Cease'N'Desistageddon, we'll chuckle about the days when instant-messengers would query, ""Hey man, is this album worth queuing?"" Because clicking a mouse was such streeenuous laaaabor.) You know what ""I Am Warm and Powerful"" is? Warm and powerful. You know what ""Travel Song"" makes one want to do? Travel. That's the thingamabob about SSLYBY: their story checks out. The dubby opening of ""Anna Lee"" is the only tempo/arrangement surprise, but it quickly reveals itself as acoustic Interpol morphing into acoustic Bloc Party, which ends up sounding like the first Of Montreal CD, and who thought Of Montreal would be around this long? The audience for these tepidly wonderful love songs would be limited only during a bitter and dissonant Prohibition that forced purveyors of bubblegum to use woodland stills. Naysayers unimpressed with crisp choruses and expert bridges might doom Broom's makers to a subcult-status alongside Western Keys or Home, but something more ambitious is afoot: The songs are fetching ciphers, stowaways on an indie pop mothership, benchwarmers on a charm offense, etc. Their caucasian convenience, their anythingness, expands their range, like how Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines could hide in a mass grave, and then in a crowd, and then in snow. If Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin's local concert hall held a battle-of-the-bands contest with the theme ""Ancestor Worship Done Right"", I wouldn't envy the members of It's a Shame About Vladimir.","Fuzzily engineered indie rock from this dual-vocaled combo.

Paquet Surprise,Greg Davis,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b513d19756521396fc/1:1/w_160/10d64c4a.jpg,2006-02-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2190-paquet-surprise/,Carpark,"Kicking ass quietly, Burlington, Vt.-based Greg Davis and Parisian Sebastian Roux's Paquet Surprise (""Surprise Package"") is an acrobatic electro-acoustic record teeming with whispered field recordings, pretty experimentalism, and sunny pop. From Davis's overflowing Jewelled Antler cover collage to the music's constant ebb and flow, the collaboration is exceedingly well-composed. Wielding a pair of music degrees, Davis is a Carpark vet and a former Keith Fullerton Whitman collaborator, a computer musician with a varied background in classical guitar, jazz, hip-hop, and improv. No slouch himself, Roux works as a programmer at IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique Musique) and excels at ambiant drone. To the credit of these musical eggheads, the collection is a surprisingly loose-limbed, magisterial treat. The first piece, ""Sea Grasses and Blue Sea"", could be the faintest field recording ever. Or not. It's hard to say what's actually making the sound, but what's dribbling out of my speakers feels much like the title suggests-- three minutes of underwater churning. More song-based, ""I Am Waiting (For December)"" is a plateau of icy glitch pop that quickly sprouts acoustic wings. The entire piece seems to be rocking on a boat; at one point, the sound of an aviary swells up and a jag of noise mixes with the humid chirps, creating a sort of feathery feedback-- enter chimes, a thumb piano, and so forth. A standard trope of the album is tumbling, ruckus-filled transitions. Otherwise, it's difficult to pick out tendencies. Ever varied, the instrumental arsenal includes a variety of guitar, voice, gong, farfisa, kalimba, autoharp, glockenspiel, toy instruments, computer, violin, mijwiz (used beautifully by Nick Castro recently), vibraphone, and piano. Pieces such as ""Air Castle"" appear to be made of invisible bricks and magic beneath those gentle acoustic strums. On the other hand, more song-like ""Good Decision"" welcomes a cloud of cicadas, a quickly flapping guitar, and Elephant 6 harmonizing. Generally, I guess the feel is comparable to Tape. The album's sublime centerpiece is the subtle, swirling ""Tidal Pool"", which slowly gathers seaweed and salt over 13 minutes. In some ways it recalls the opener, but cycles more like, well, a tide pool with a lapping, clipped percussion track-- until it bursts into dainty droning vocal choruses and glisteny sonics. This is followed by ""I Never Met Her"", a vocally muted Sea And Cake shake-n-wobble and another semiprecious pop piece, ""Daybreak"", which feels like a cultish magic carpet ride with its shellfish percussion and songing gong. Describing each track makes the album sound like a bestiary, but in some regards, that's exactly what it is. Paquet Surprise is filled with so many textures and ideas it feels like some Edenic tapestry delineating the natural and the digital as one densely populated world.","Carpark issues this acrobatic electro-acoustic record, which teems with whispered field recordings, pretty experimentalism, and sunny pop.

Donuts,J Dilla,by: Will Dukes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb56c0084474cd0c2826/1:1/w_160/8df46677.jpg,2006-02-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/,Stones Throw,"J Dilla's eagerly awaited Donuts, the follow-up to 2001's Welcome 2 Detroit (released as Jay Dee), is, like its predecessor, a stark departure from the cozy-socks-and-Xbox feel of his former group, Slum Village. In fact, Dilla, if anything, is imposing a meta-rap bent on neo-soul, assaulting the senses in ways unseemly for a guy who used to work with Q-Tip. The drums, though remarkably fluid, are lighter, domineered by dense, abrasive samples that are sequenced with a sense of swing. Percussive end pieces are shorn cheese-grater sharp, then appended to sickly spliced moans. The end result is akin to Norman Smith and DJ Shadow sitting in on a RZA-produced session-- spry, voiceless prog-hop by any other name. Opener ""Workinonit"" comes on like a Rubin-produced take on Schoolhouse Rock. Clang-y guitars give way to doubled-up groans and what sounds like a back-masked Zulu chant. The sample, supplied by '60s soulsters Them, is diced with manic precision, and around the 2:00 mark, the melody builds to a climax, fading, with echo-y vocal bits, into bodiless abyss. Equally engaging is ""Anti-American Graffiti"", which combines lighters-up, love-not-war humility with a track both wistful and world-weary: A crazed voice spouts end-of-the-world admonishments like some disenfranchised apparition, colliding with somber guitars. ""Don't Cry"" finds Dilla taking sprightly, blu-lite soul crooning and flipping it counter-cockeyed: ""If Blue Magic or Whoever could see me now!"" First he plays the original, then throws in the ""Now, you play it and I'll show you how my voice would have made it unbelievable!"" bit, before gently lifting its face off. It's chest thumping, to be sure, like the Copa shot in Goodfellas or Bigger and Deffer. And it's courteous. Similarly cordial is ""Time: The Donut of the Heart"", where he turns the Jackson 5's ""All I Do Is Think of You"" into a lucid dream-- the song's intro is now with the chorus it always coveted. Says ?uestlove: ""[J Dilla] time compresses Michael and Jermaine's ad-libs with the uneasy ease of a tightrope-walker, with oil shoes on, crossing one 90-story building to another, after eight shots of [Patrone]."" I'm sayin'. Not that Donuts deals with only obvious sample sources-- ""The Twister (Huh, What)"" is the sound of flu-sick flutes chiming in time to a busted weathervane; ""Waves"", a hiccuping Hare Krishna class. It's Dilla's show-and-tell method, however, that's most effective, because it illustrates how he's, more or less, upgrading soul music-- we get to see how he unpacked its bag, what spots he told it it missed. This approach also allows Dilla to pay homage to the selfsame sounds he's modernized; the drums are light, to reflect the original sound from which he's borrowing. In that sense, Donuts is pure postmodern art-- which was hip-hop's aim in the first place.","Jay Dee continues to update soul music by paying homage to the selfsame sounds he's modernizing.

October Language,Belong,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b0c0084474cd0c054a/1:1/w_160/fc2a19bb.jpg,2006-02-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1196-october-language/,Carpark,"Mark Richardson, in a rare show of hand, once admitted in a review that he had a crippling soft spot for this specific shimmery wet electric sound, as championed by everyone from Jesus and Mary Chain and MBV to Fennesz and Tim Hecker to Wolfgang Voigt and Radian to Yume Bitsu and Polmo Polpo. I'm prone to the same critical shortcircuiting; if you make a record with that sound, I will probably like it; if you do it well, I will abuse it. Recorded in pre-ravaged New Orleans, this processed guitar noise record might get tagged ""Disintegration Loops for Hurricane Katrina."" But the album is much more nuanced emotionally, less conceptual, better edited, and songy in the way Black Dice or Isolée can be songy. Some tracks, like ""Remove the Inside"", sound like Belong may have written them out on staff: simple melodies stretched out so we feel the jumps in tone from note to note, and hear the color changes as those perfect pitch adverts tell us. Glee Club kids, there's a song here called ""Who Told You This Room Exists"" that sounds like Josquin's ""Tu solus"" slowed down, burnt vinyl caught on the lock track, the guitars swelling like bass men right before the progression resolves and breathes in again. The nylon is more audible on ""I'm Too Sleepy...Shall We Swim"", guitar strums blowing over crackly, pitch-black silence like fingers brushing skin-- nerve-wracking, romantic, intense, and hardly there at all. Of course, the second I mention the title track's slide guitar siren or the breathy static, how it drapes waves of rolling white noise that inch closer and closer until it swallows us loud and whole... I mean if October Language isn't about Katrina, it's at least about hardship, big or small or personal, and music's curious power to help us deal.","New Orleans band follows in the shimmery, usually electronics-led footsteps of JAMC, Fennesz, and Tim Hecker.

To: Elliott / From: Portland,Various Artists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4745e6ef9596932089b/1:1/w_160/c1a4650f.gif,2006-02-08 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11831-to-elliottfrom-portland/,Expunged,"Faulting a tribute album for sucking is like faulting a lion for killing a zebra: It's just being true to its nature. Even tributes to the sturdiest music often winds up negligible at best, hamstrung by a combination of unfathomable artist selection criteria, poorly chosen artist-to-song pairings, and tossed-off, demo-ish production work. And that's a shame, because tribute albums have the potential to stimulate that world-colliding excitement some of us recall from the comic book crossovers of our youth, one of the key rules of which is that you don't pair stars with nobodies. When tribute albums fall flat, it's often because they violate this rule. D.C.'s Batman versus Image's Spawn is a surefire box office smash, but can you imagine Batman taking on, say, Marvel's Power Pack? So if it's remarkable that To: Elliott / From: Portland doesn't suck, it's even more remarkable that it doesn't suck while violating this rule. Since all the contributing artists are from the deceased singer's Portland home, the tracklist is rounded out by more than a few-- sorry, guys-- nobodies. Naturally, much of the credit for the tribute's overall success goes to the bands, which, for the most part, have turned in some very considered, fleshed-out renditions of Smith's songs. But a lot also has to go to Smith himself: Whatever qualms some may have with his aesthetic, he was a very fine songwriter, and on the strength of his source material, even the unknown acts come off surprisingly well. I'd have bought a Power Pack comic if Wolverine was in it, you know? The tribute kicks off with its big-name draw, a Decemberists cover of ""Clementine"". With its opening rustle of sheet music, languid count-off, and muzzy harmonicas, it evinces exactly the sense of intimacy that attracted fans to Smith's music in the first place, and Colin Meloy does a good job of imposing his brassy twang without decimating the delicacy of the melody. The Helio Sequence drenches ""Satellite"" in weepy synths, otherwise playing it close to the hip. Swords handles ""I Didn't Understand"" in their usual ""we're not quite Death Cab, but close"" style. Even Eric Matthews holds his own, recasting ""Needle in the Hay"" as a great, fuzzed-out rock creeper. One has to assume that the target demo for an Elliott Smith tribute is Elliott Smith's fanbase, which contains a significant contingent aligned around the belief that any attempt to cover the perfection of an Elliott Smith song is to utterly ruin it. When Stereogum posted Crosstide's cover of ""Angeles"" (which is pretty good-- synths quiver and swell behind the subdued vocal delivery, pushed along by a drum machine that seems like a deliberate slap in the face to indie folk diehards), the initial run of comments read like a more damning parody of the Smith purist than anything I could devise. ""The synth takes away all of the subtle resolve of the original,"" one poster complained. ""I thought most of the song's integrity were [sic] destroyed,"" opined another. This one, fuming: ""It could easily make the lameness that is the O.C. Yuck, how awful."" And my favorite, ""ugh as Elliott's biggest fan, it's really hard to listen to this, mostly cause it's crappy and the electro shit in the background is so cheesy and makes the song way lame. Sorry Elliott."" The value system that emerges is crushingly predictable-- crappy recordings of acoustic instrumentation, good; anything digital, bad; palpable emotion more important than craft. But if to play an Elliott Smith song with even a hint of deviation from its original form is sacrilege, then these Smithies must be approaching the album fully prepared to be appalled, maybe even relishing the opportunity. To their credit, there are a couple of truly galling moments. We Are Telephones bludgeons ""Division Day"" into an overbearing, MOR sledgehammer, and in a move that seems deviously engineered to enrage purists, Lifesavas turns in a rap cover of ""Happiness"" that's less terrible than it has any right to be-- but this is only in relation to its being a rap cover of Elliott Smith; it's still a tad painful. Sometimes, two great tastes do not, in fact, taste great together. But for most of this tribute, they do, and casual listeners who haven't invested Smith with such heavy personal resonance will find plenty to enjoy, even if a lot of his core audience balks. Sorry, Elliott.","Tribute record to the late Elliott Smith features contributions from Oregon-based artists such as the Decemberists, the Thermals, and Eric Matthews.

She Wants Revenge,She Wants Revenge,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cdea9e61561daa5445/1:1/w_160/7255f99e.jpg,2006-02-07 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7843-she-wants-revenge/,Geffen,"Paul Banks, meet your stunt double. It seems every week someone's crying wolf over a new Joy Division-via-Interpol soundalike that's really only a half-hatched post-punk band with a stuffy nosed singer. Yet this L.A. duo practically copies Interpol's DNA with a genre-warping flair that'd crush the Bravery's Skabba the Hutt dude. You see, She Wants Revenge bears more resemblance to Soulwax than, say, the Killers. DJs Adam ""Adam 12"" Bravin and Justin Warfield spawned this indie chameleon after several years of dabbling in the West Coast club scene, most notably Warfield's promising 1993 Prince Paul-produced rap debut and his sophomore slumpy arena rock album released under the moniker The Justin Warfield Supernaut. Rappers turned indie rockers? Heresy! Well, on a fundamental level, probably, but SWR circumvents the genre integrity question with precision and time-tested professionalism. While Warfield and Bravin don't deserve bonus points for actually being teenagers during the 80s as they suggest, they're studio rats who trouble and toil for the exact sounds necessary to propel their mediocre songwriting. Also, they're not making any effort to hide their influences. Titles like ""I Don't Want To Fall In Love"" and ""Tear You Apart"" are lazy permutations of post-punk poetry, and the whole psychotic female protagonist shtick spans from ""She's Lost Control"" to ""Stella Was a Diver And She Was Always Down"". Basically SWR songs come in two breeds-- sprawling drone operas á la ""PDA"" sans catchiness, and clubby goth-stompers that force Madchester scenery on unreceptive American audiences. Single ""Sister"" captains the former category, dropping an overcast surf riff that crashes at the chorus, t-boning an equally menacing synth. Problem is, all the rock tracks have the same melody, so if you didn't like the guitar/vocals interplay on ""Sister"" you'll really hate it on opener ""Red Flags And Long Nights"", and by ""Someone Must Get Hurt"" you'll already have turned your iPod off to watch 24 Hour Party People. Like so many mid-level retro bands, SWR feel most comfortable playing the dance-rock card, though the strategy creates a glass ceiling. Sure, the hooks on ""I Don't Want To Fall In Love"" and ""Monologue"" strike the hardest, but at best they're eerily predictable. The rhythm section doesn't help either, permanently stuck on a default setting somewhere between industrial and Duran Duran. Sadly, the brightest spots burn the shortest, such as the two-and-a-half minute fugue ""Disconnect"" or Pornography offspring ""Us"". Too ugly and inaccessible to suggest some sort of post-punk cash-out, they stick out in a batch of songs too bent on edifying studio wizardry over musicianship.","Modern rock radio-friendly new wave revivalism from Justin Warfield.

Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas,Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf4ea9e61561daa77fe/1:1/w_160/64ce0880.gif,2006-02-07 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5000-lindstrm-prins-thomas/,Eskimo,"At the forefront of a group of dance artists and producers with marked affinities for 70s disco, soft rock, soundtracks, and prog, Norwegian duo Hans-Peter Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas are often thought of as the posterboys for ""space disco"" (aka a lot of other things, the funniest of which I've heard is ""beardo house""). Between the two of them, they've produced some of the best dance music, regardless of genre, over the past few years: ""I Feel Space"", ""Goettsching"", ""There's a Drink In My Bedroom and I Need a Hot Lady"", ""Alien In My Pocket"", and remixes for just about anyone who's been given techno props at Pitchfork. Their sound is a mixture of nostalgia and retro-futuristic sheen, mining similar emotional spacefields as Daft Punk, Avalanches, Air, and LCD Soundsystem, even if they don't necessarily cross the same musical borders. Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas is the duo's first full-length album, and rather than stuff it with previous released singles or B-sides, they've opted for mostly new music. And much like with James Murphy's LCDS record from last year, it could have used a few more ringers: While L&PT; gives a serviceable account of what these guys do, most of the songs aren't exactly their best. Tunes like ""Boney M Down"" or ""Claudia"", with almost identical drum patterns and basslines, pass by without much fanfare or reason to listen to them. They're pleasant, and though hardly ""bad,"" are examples of an already smooth record gone completely passive. Conversely, the slow ballad ""Don O Van Budd"" works passivity to its advantage, leaving empty space in between its sluggish beats and building tension in the process-- even if it's the kind of tension you might hear in a Lionel Richie song. The best stuff on the record seems effortless and breezy by comparison. Opening track ""Foreløpig Bit"" features a masterful arrangement of disco rhythm section (and another variation of what is apparently the pair's favorite bassline), quasi-Arabic synth melody, and one of Lindstrøm's signature chord changes, which transforms the song from good vamp to lovely surprise. The underrated 2005 single ""Turkish Delight"" isn't as extravagant, but features one of many nice guitar leads, and a subtle, Italo-informed synthesizer riff in the background that lends much-needed forward momentum. ""Sykkelsesong"" is heavier, and also features a cool, vaguely Afrobeat guitar riding atop a hard disco pulse, and with a big, pillowy synth cluster punctuating the ends of phrases every now and then. The melody is there, but like many of the pair's best tracks, it's not necessarily as important as the overall effect of perpetual motion and organic performance. Of course, a mixed bag LP hardly dents Lindstrøm & Thomas' reputation for A-list singles and remixes. As of this writing, Lindstrøm has released two singles since this record came out (""Monsteer"", and ""Mighty Girl"" with Thomas) better than most of what you'll find here. I say keep tracking their progress-- and lobby for a comp.","Debut full-length from the influential production team is, unfortunately, not a compilation of their frequently exquisite singles but an album of mostly new material.

Pop Ambient 2006,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a807c0084474cd0c0d29/1:1/w_160/d2616315.jpg,2006-02-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2022-pop-ambient-2006/,Kompakt,"Kompakt's Pop Ambient series, currently in its sixth edition, is a low-key affair all the way around. No one expects these round-ups to be barometers of a sub-genre's health, the way the label's Total comps can be; no ground is broken in terms of form or technology. The Pop Ambients arrive without much of fanfare and are consistently enjoyable if rarely revelatory. The differences from year to year are subtle and have more to do with curatorial whim than any overriding trends. Pop Ambient 2006 gets its particular flavor from artists that seem particularly enamored of the sound of traditional stringed instruments. More than half the tracks make prominent use of guitar or piano, often untreated, which often has an odd dating effect, drawing the mind back to sample-heavy ambient house of the early 90s. At its best, as on Uli Teichmann's opening ""Piano Tec"", the electro-acoustic blend conjures the gloriously adventurous Cluster in their mid-70s heyday. Elsewhere, the choice of sounds seems more formulaic. Markus Guentner & La Grande Illusion's static ""Baghira"", built around a simple loop of a plucked guitar chord, aims for poignancy and doesn't come close. The best moments come when producers step outside established templates. The Orb's ""Edelgrün"", with its guitar strum, piano chord loop, and bouncy rhythm, exits the background zone completely and serves as relaxed (and quite wonderful) instrumental pop. A stranger twist comes from the inclusion of two cover songs, an idea that would have been unthinkable on the vaporous and abstract Pop Ambient 2001. Sebastian Meissner's Klimek confronts one of the giants of the genre as he pairs with a harpist to tackle Satie's ""Gymnopedie #1"". It's a respectful deconstruction, with only a couple stutters and a smidge of digital noise to let us know we're not listening to the soundtrack to a credit card commercial; the melody is as detached and lovely as ever. Far more compelling is Justus Köhncke & Fred Heimermann take on Fleetwood Mac's laidback instrumental ""Albatross"", which brilliantly buries the original guitar refrain original under a sequence of percussive guitar plucks and a thick layer of frosted processing. Pass Into Silence's ""Iceblink"" and Mikkel Metal's ""Decline"" hearken back to Pop Ambient's original sonic inspiration, the percolating organic drone late-period work of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, but these cottony bliss-outs are few. Instead we get a more tuneful Pop Ambient with a slight classicist bent. Tasteful as ever, which cuts both ways.","Sixth edition in Kompakt's annual collection of low-key house features contributions from Justus Köhncke, Markus Guentner, and Mikkel Metal.

Detrola,His Name Is Alive,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0f2abf31b7dc715653f/1:1/w_160/4846cced.jpg,2006-02-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3884-detrola/,Reincarnate,"Warn Defever is the kind of musician who seems to stand in the corner, speaking very quietly, surrounded only by those who most want to listen. His records-- 15 years' worth of them-- feel, above all, private. Some of that privacy comes from genre and style: The music can be dreamy and abstracted, qualities that once made His Name Is Alive a natural fit for the arty English label 4AD. More often, though, it's down to Defever's singular approach to recording, always several degrees off from the conventions of normal pop. The drums hide away, like in pre-rock recordings; they add rhythm but rarely drive the whole. The instruments sound neither glossy nor raw, natural nor artificial; mostly they're just quiet, minimized, almost pious. The air around them-- and there can be plenty of it-- seems strangely empty, the same way winter snow can deaden all noise. And then there's the treatment of voices, almost always those of women, foregrounded above all else, and treated so that they feel like someone is singing softly right in your ear-- in calm, repetitive, uncomplicated chants. The effect is such that it's hard to imagine anyone listening to this music when not alone. Couples, maybe. Crowds, parties-- how? The amazing thing, then, is that Defever's musical world is anything but insular, anything but stuck in that corner. Some of his influences are unsurprising: The slurry, ghostly pop His Name Is Alive made for 4AD has run toward shoegazing and electronics, Beach Boys worship, and dub experiment. Some of the other sources are more remarkable than Defever gets credit for. He grew up in the orbit of Detroit and learned guitar from his grandfather; he has old-time music in him, not as a curiosity but as a presence: folk, country, blues, and gospel, from 1950 backward. The fact that his project is no longer with that arty English label may even have something to do with their last two albums-- on which Defever quietly and unselfconsciously set about making collections of blues and soul music. None of this is pastiche, or dabbling, or borrowing styles-- each of these threads winds its way naturally into that private world. You probably wouldn't hear a His Name Is Alive song and describe it as ""blues""; you'd spend hours with it before realizing how strange it would be to call it anything else. All of this is truer than ever on Detrola, the group's first full-length in four years, and their first since leaving 4AD. Every one of those sounds runs through here, woven together so naturally that the weaving itself is the furthest thing from the listener's mind: This sounds like absolutely nothing but a His Name Is Alive record, and one too shockingly good to go thinking much about constituent parts. Its bookends are dirges, laments-- a fiddled spiritual on ""Introduction"" (""The darkest night I ever saw was the night I left my love"") and folk blues on ""I'll Send My Face to Your Funeral"" (""I've seen too many things I couldn't stand to see""). In between, the most remarkable things happen. There's the same lulling, hypnotic tone that's always made the band an indie affair-- the same soft-spoken beauty as fellow private types like Red House Painters. But there's plenty more. ""After I Leave U"" makes pop from synthesizers that's anything but synth-pop; too brittle and strange, and too natural, so that the eventual appearance of a vocorder still feels fiercely alien. ""Seven Minutes"" is brittle r&b, shot through with free-jazz saxophone runs, as voiced by Lovetta Pippen, one of three women singing on this record. ""Get Your Curse On"", the record's emotional peak, is also its uplift, a swinging piano-pop bounce that feels like Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick in a sexual battle of wills: They defend (""Your ju-ju comes in short supply/ Your curse won't work on me this time"") and they attack (""I could turn you on so fast/ Your heart, your heart, your hands, your hands""). It's a short record-- just under 40 minutes-- and better for it; the second half sweeps you effortlessly along to that final dirge. ""CAT*S"" is electro-pop hypnosis, shuffling along on two chords, mutating drum breaks, and meowing synths. ""You Need a Heart"" shoots back to the sweet, delicate sonic candy of 1996's Stars on ESP, the peak of Defever's Beach Boys fixation. ""I Thought I Saw"", closer to the start, is doing either Memphis soul or Steely Dan southern-California studio action; it hardly seems to matter which. What matters is that Defever is doing exactly what we've always claimed to want from musicians. His world is his own, unique and uniquely stylized, describable less in terms of genre and more in terms of impressions: snow, transistor radios, empty rooms, sepia tones, dreams. More importantly, his world is large: There are wide ranges of the history of American music in here, whether exhibited or just acknowledged. He's cloistered, but he's not a solipsist. On Detrola, the music feels as private as ever; you'll come to this exhibit one at a time, and it's still too particular in its tastes to imagine a large audience for it. But it's fantastic art, full of depth and warmth and creativity. It's probably the best thing Defever's ever done. ","Former 4AD mainstay Warn Defever relocates to Reincarnate and creates a winning record of slurry, ghostly pop.

After all, guitarist Bryce Dessner pulls double duty with both groups, while Clogs leader Padma Newsome has guested on all three National albums. As if there's not enough cross-pollination happening, Bryce's brother Aaron (also a guitarist for the National) is featured on Lantern, Clogs' fourth album. And if this is your first exposure to Clogs, you've picked a fantastic time to become acquainted. Lantern is the most fully realized version of Clogs' aesthetic, seamlessly mixing their musical reference points-- classical, European folk, post-rock-- into a unique sound. Unlike previous Clogs albums, which primarily featured compositions written either solely by Newsome, or in conjunction with Dressner, Lantern is a collaborative effort. Each original track on this disc is credited to the group as a whole, and this joint effort shows in the performances. This collaborative spirit extends beyond the confines of the group. Lantern's first track is performed by a guest, Italian Baroque guitarist Luca Tarantino, who turns in a fine solo interpretation of a piece by 17th Century lute player Johann Hieronymus Kapsberger. On most instrumental albums, both the slow, steady ""Canon"" and the more impatient ""5/4""-- the two cuts that earn the group their post-rock merit badges for 2006-- would be the unassailable high points. On this disc, they're vying for space with lots of worthy candidates. Newsome's lyrical violin plays counterpoint to Rachael Elliot's mournful bassoon on ""2:3:5"", giving way to a elliptical swirl of steel drums; on the title track his plaintive voice asks for a light to bring him home. ""Tides of Washington Bridge"" appears twice on Lantern-- first as a wistful piece centered around ukulele and mandola, punctuated by soft bursts of guitar feedback as it ends, then performed solely on piano, the sad melody circling upon itself. Yes, for the most part, this is a downbeat record, albeit with one notable exception: ""The Song of the Cricket"", which builds to a gentle portentous crescendo. Near the end, however, it deftly switches to a comical jazzy strut that doesn't sound the least bit out of place. A few more moments of levity might be a welcome addition to the group's repertoire, but this is a minor gripe. This album finds an already adventurous group of musicians combining their ambition and skill to create an engaging work.","Strongest record yet from the adventurous post-rock band, which features the National guitarist Bryce Dessner.

Comfort of Strangers,Beth Orton,by: Stephen M.

""I'm your apple-eatin' heathen, any ol' rib-stealin' Eve,"" she sings on the chorus, turning talk of original sin into empowering invective against some unnamed target. It's an odd song with an odd little shuffle to it, and even though it sounds uncannily like Fiona Apple (right down to her rushed cadence at the end of the second verse), the track reminds you how singular Orton seemed on her first two albums and how much she buffed away the rough edges on her third album, Daybreaker, an AOR makeover that aimed for but missed the same listeners who one year later made Norah Jones a sensation. So it's nice to have the old Beth Orton back. It's also nice to have Jim O'Rourke at the helm, particularly because he puts some rhythm back into her songs. Orton needs it, too: Her voice hits your ears at an angle, as if refracted prismatically, and O'Rourke's sturdy beats don't reset that angle to perpendicular so much as make sure it hits its target with a little more force. Comfort of Strangers is strongest when O'Rourke and percussionist Tim Barnes translate Trailer Park's spacey effects into earthier rhythms, especially with the oscillating bassline and tight drum beat on ""Conceived"". They let loose on ""Countenance"" and are joined by what sounds like a full band on ""Shopping Trolley"". The intro to the title track sounds like ""Walk on the Wild Side"", but to their credit, Orton and O'Rourke undercut that seedy strut with handclaps, sparkling piano, and perhaps her most straightforward performance. Orton's vocals-- so arced and mellifluous-- reign over all other sounds on Comfort of Strangers. On Daybreaker, her voice sounded like an empty vessel, beautiful but conveying very little; here it has a very real personality behind it, one that allows itself to be angry, cynical, hopeful, and snide-- a complex and compelling emotional mess. This attitude fits her songwriting well, giving her words added resonance. On ""Heartland Truckstop"" she sings, ""I wanted to love, but I turned 'round and hated it,"" and her strong, glaring delivery of that second line-- as if she's making eye contact through her voice-- reinforces not just the wordplay, but the cheated disappointment of the sentiment. Death of love is the constant, often oppressive theme of Comfort of Strangers, which gives these songs the feel of dark therapy, often so dour as to be claustrophobic. The sense of a lesson learned, however platitudinous, on the closer ""Pieces of the Sky"" finally tempers Orton's clenched emotions: ""When it's over it's over/ I best get busy living/been a long time gone."" But ""A Place Aside"" and ""Safe in Your Arms"" comprise the album's still-worn heart. In ""A Place Aside"" her concrete imagery (""Pull me close and we lay still/ Wrap my toes around your heel"") risks an intimacy that suggests the heartache that ostensibly inspired the other songs, but ""Safe"" undercuts that sentiment as Orton wonders if the past's good memories are worth the present's bleak pain. Torn between the illusion of security and the reality of heartbreak, these songs remain complex and open-ended, her questions unanswered. That's the key to Comfort of Strangers and the source of its impact. Far from perfect-- at times even dull-- these songs balance their heavy despair with genuine, if hesitant, hope. The contrasts in the music mirror her internal struggle, even if Comfort of Strangers is destined always to mean more to its makers than to its listeners.","After MOR disappointment Daybreaker, the English chanteuse teams with Jim O'Rourke on this mellifluously voiced collection of songs.

Phoenician Flu and Ancient Ocean,Residual Echoes,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a325c0084474cd0c01e6/1:1/w_160/f193994f.gif,2006-02-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6953-phoenician-flu-and-ancient-ocean/,Holy Mountain,"My brother resides in Santa Cruz. When I last visited, I heard a Doors cover band playing a house party overlooking the beach. At the time, I was burying myself headfirst in the sand. Okay, the city boasts three homegrown serial killers (thank you, Answer Me) and my brother told me Killer Klowns From Outer Space's finale was filmed on the Santa Cruz boardwalk, but I've yet to figure out how the otherwise mellow enclave inspired Comets On Fire and Residual Echoes to beat the stuffing out of fret boards. Guess I ought to investigate the next time I'm in town: There must be a darker, brackish stream flowing beneath the salted surfers, hippies, coffee shops, and organic markets. Whatever their place of origin, Residual Echoes are a fluctuating troupe led by Adam Payne, who's earned support and endorsements from Comets' Ethan Miller and Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny. At the time of Phoenician Flu and Ancient Ocean's recording, the live band was a sextet; nowadays, I'm unsure where the numbers stand, but judging from how Payne digs into solos and unravels instruments, he could muster a bottle-rocket orchestra without outside assistance. Imagine MacGyver with a fuzz box. Following the boogie-woogie thrust of the eponymous debut, Payne and company spend little time worrying about where songs start or stop: Pieces blend and collide into interwoven guitar, horn, bass, piano, ""voodoo,"" and ""thunder."" It's tighter, relatively speaking, and more downcast than the earlier album. There are seven tracks on the menu-- the first two are strongest. Opener ""Death Comes For the Archbishop"" grafts feedbacking space-psych with deep-sea excavations (seismic drum shifts and bass pulsations). You could fry an egg on some of its licks. The Hendrixian blaze is followed by ""Lorelei"", a stoner rock prom theme with fluid soloing. After that, the restlessness begins to feel increasingly rote. ""{G}-x-nou(gh) Part II"" is a sludge mountain with thundercrack percussion and Monoshock explosives, but it bores. ""Knowe Part I"" reintroduces, then demos Nick Drake's ""Know"", snuffing out the Pink Moon with a 4-track galactic hunt, trumpet overdubs, and the ambience of a hurricane sneaking across an ocean floor. ""Greetings Ancient Ocean"" is an uninspired, incidentally tender ballad. It made me think of Langhorne Slim. Extended closer ""Bleu Eyes"" incorporates the Carter Family into its flubbed satellite notes, ring-tone blues riffs, and jazzy vibes. Only a schlep would deny the mightiness of the riffs, but despite anarchic aims, Phoenician Flu levels into a general flight pattern. In that way, the album (and the band) share a tendency with rockers like Pearls & Brass or maybe Cheeseburger, who understand dynamics and can appear like brilliant firecrackers in small bursts, but over longer hauls have yet to convince me that they'll ever surpass pastiche. Residual Echoes' chaotic debut proved messes are often incredibly gorgeous, with the code cracked, the formula solved, I find it hard to keep listening.","Chaotic release from a band who's earned support and endorsements from Comets on Fire's Ethan Miller and Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny.

Bells For Augustin Lesage,Directing Hand,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbce13d197565213b18c/1:1/w_160/1118ab56.jpg,2006-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2635-bells-for-augustin-lesage/,Secret Eye,"The story goes that French artist Augustin Lesage didn't begin to paint until the age of 36, when he received instruction during a séance from spirit voices advising him, ""Have no fear, follow our advice. One day you will become a painter...We will guide your hand."" So Lesage obediently began to spend his free time painting, believing his work to be fully dictated and channeled through him by unseen forces. And on Bells For Augustin Lesage, the latest recording from Alex Neilson's solo/group project Directing Hand, it appears that the musicians have taken to heart Lesage's creative principles, particularly his overriding doctrine: ""Do not try to understand what you are doing."" Following a couple of limited edition CD-Rs, Bells For Augustin Lesage essentially stands as Directing Hand's debut album, and as such offers the best vantage yet of Neilson's unique talents. A prolific Scottish free percussionist, Neilson has played alongside Will Oldham, Richard Youngs, and Alasdair Roberts-- and his underground credentials are such that in 2004 he was enlisted to play drums for Jandek's first live performance. Although Directing Hand is billed as a solo vehicle, Neilson here receives help from such like-minded compatriots as Christina Carter, Isobel Campbell, and Scatter's Chris Hladowski. Together these gathered musicians resemble a small ceremonial orchestra, their music a tranquil swarm of honeyed drones, fluttering percussion, and unbound, heaven-cast vocals. Despite the presence of two classic British folk ballads, ""Hangman"" and ""Lowlands"", there is little about Bells that translates as traditional folk. Instead, Directing Hand use these ballads as points of entry into their ecstatic, unclassifiable improvisations, much in the manner of experimental Finnish collectives like Avarus or Kemialliset Ystävät. (Enough so, in fact, to suspect that Neilson might perhaps have some Finnish blood in him somewhere.) Behind these ballads' slender vocal melodies, the ensemble uses a spectacle of ragged strings, bowed cymbals, and shepherd's horns to refract the songs' lyrical, melancholic longing into distinctive and uncommonly tactile new forms. Prior to these ballads, Directing Hand walk other medieval avenues, as on the solitary drone of the opening invocation ""Beamsley Beacon"", or the splintered Harry Partch rattle of the extended ""Black Herman"". Another peak is reached on ""Tongue of the Bell"", an 11-minute epic that stands as perhaps the purest distillation of the group's peculiar communal power, incorporating skronky European jazz, shimmering vocal chants, and sky-wide metalwork drones into its motley bedlam. Throughout the album, Neilson and the rest of his ensemble perform with the loose, soft-focused attention of a medium awaiting further instructions from beyond. And while there are obviously certain structural limits to this manner of automatic composition, Bells For Augustin Lesage proves Directing Hand capable of tremendous shamanic heights, whoever its ultimate spiritual author might be.","After a handful of CD-Rs, this is the proper debut from a prolific Scottish free percussionist who has played alongside Will Oldham, Richard Youngs, and Jandek.

The Best of Studio One / Full Up: More Hits From Studio One / Downbeat the Ruler: Killer Instrumentals from Studio One,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a862ea9e61561daa57e5/1:1/w_160/7d413088.jpg,2006-02-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11715-the-best-of-studio-one-full-up-more-hits-from-studio-one-downbeat-the-ruler-killer-instrumentals-from-studio-one/,Heartbeat,"Clement ""Coxsone"" Dodd might be the most important figure in Jamaican music, even if he's not the first name that springs to mind when people think of reggae, dub, ska, rocksteady, dancehall, or any other Jamaican idiom. From his days running one of Kingston's most successful sound systems through the founding of the Studio One label and studio to his relocation to New York in the mid-1980s, Dodd was at or near the forefront of Jamaican music, weathering and helping shape each new trend. Nearly every major name in the island's music scene recorded for him at least once, and such luminaries as Prince Buster, Lee Perry, Dennis Brown, and Peter Tosh (Bob Marley came to Dodd with Tosh & the Wailers after recording just four tracks for Leslie Kong) began their careers working with or for him. Dodd was also one of the original innovators of the signature Jamaican off-beat rhythm. His production of Theophilus Beckford's instrumental ""Easy Snappin'"" is, along with early productions by Edward Seaga and Prince Buster, among the first recordings to hint at the transformation of straight-ahead Jamaican r&b; into ska. Naturally, over the course of three decades, Dodd compiled an imposing back catalog, and approaching it as a newcomer to reggae is daunting, to put it mildly. Given that a collection of ""the best of Studio One"" could easily be a 12-disc box set, it stands to reason that the folks at Heartbeat didn't have much trouble finding 32 killer tracks to spread across The Best of Studio One (this release is a remastered and expanded version of a 1985 compilation with informative, if somewhat partisan, liner notes) and its companion volume, Full Up. Both volumes are excellent and serve nicely as a starting point to Studio One, but they're also likely to appeal to people who've already done a little exploring, as each includes a mixture of big and small names. Bringing together material spanning from rocksteady to the early dancehall years, these discs aren't exactly focused, but even as styles shifted and the studio setup expanded, the Studio One sound remained pretty consistent, with simple, in-the-pocket drumming, phenomenal basslines, great horn arrangements, and plenty of amazing vocal harmonies. The Best of Studio One features three of Jamaica's greatest soul vocalists, John Holt, Alton Ellis, and Ken Boothe, each in superb form. Ellis's ""Can I Change My Mind"" skanks so easy it feels weightless, and Boothe's ""Just Another Girl"" features some backing harmonies for his supple voice to play off. A handful of great rocksteady harmony groups present reggae's sweet side, lead by the Heptones' drifting three-part vocal arrangement on ""Party Time"". Slim Smith's ""Born to Love"" sound like the Impressions in Jamaica, while the Lyrics, later to become famous for the Marcus Garvey tribute ""Black Star Liner"", sound deceptively sugary on the obliquely topical ""Music Like Dirt"". Dancehall star Johnny Osborne's honey voice mingles beautifully with roots harmonies on the transcendent ""Jah Promise"", one of several pointedly Rastafarian songs. The Rasta angle is taken further by the Abyssinians, who get overtly political on 1969's ""Declaration of Rights"", singing ""Get up and fight for your rights, my brothers/ Get up and fight for your rights, my sisters"" in something of a warm-up for the following year's epochal ""Satta Massa Gana"", one of reggae's defining militant tracks. Full Up features a similar balance of the sweet and the heavy, opening with the lilting rocksteady of ""Love Me Forever"", by Carlton & the Shoes and sprinkling soul tracks like Bob Evans and the Paragons' horn-fueled ""Danger in Your Eyes"" and the Royals' harmony-soaked ""Pick Up the Pieces"" around Babylon call-outs from roots icons Burning Spear and Culture. Culture's ""Behold the Land"" is a particularly stunning affirmation of black pride set against the history of slavery. Willie Williams tackles modern iniquity on ""Armagideon Time"", singing ""A lot of people won't get no justice tonight/ So a lot of people going to have to stand up and fight"" over the Sound Dimension's classic ""Real Rock"" riddim. Which brings us to a third Studio One release: Downbeat the Ruler collects instrumentals from the late 60s and early 70s, focusing primarily on the rocksteady era, when the Sound Dimension (originally known as the Soul Vendors) ruled as Studio One's house band. Featuring ex-Skatalites Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo, the Sound Dimension backed dozens of singers on a slew of hits in the late 60s, but they made just as great an impact with their instrumentals, most of which have been versioned and copied many times over. The Sound Dimension's importance to the sound of Studio One from 1967 onward is evidenced by the fact that seven of the 18 tracks on the disc are theirs, with an additional three from the Soul Vendors, and solo tracks from Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo. Mittoo's ""Freak Out"" is a deep groover, grounded by his subtle Hammond organ and a massive bassline, with a great, easy-flowing horn arrangement on top. The Sound Dimension's ""Real Rock"" is a defining track for its stabbing organ hook, immense groove, and drawn-out trombone melody. Dub Specialist's ""Banana Walk"" and the Soul Vendors' 10-minute ""Death in the Arena"" showcase Studio One's early embrace of dub, though Dodd's dub output was always overshadowed by that of Lee Perry, Augustus Pablo, and King Tubby. These three discs offer a look at just a tiny slice of the incredible body of work Dodd oversaw during his lifetime, but it's a good slice, below the radar for most Americans but not so obscure or arcane that newcomers will have trouble getting behind the offbeat. I'd recommend The Best of Studio One and Full Up-- solid introductions to Dodd's inestimable legend-- to just about anybody, while Downbeat the Ruler is a better bet for those already committed to exploring Jamaican music in its various guises.","Trio of compilations-- two new, one a reissue-- mine the vaults of Coxsone Dodd's incomparable Studio One label.

Security Screenings,Prefuse 73,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11a13d197565213854e/1:1/w_160/9806e7c9.jpg,2006-02-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6454-security-screenings/,Warp,"Few albums since Metal Machine Music have been as aptly titled as Security Screenings. As with airports, its moments can snap from pleasant daydream to unnecessary hassle in the time it takes to put your handgun in someone else's bag. In an effort to get into the mind of Guillermo Scott Herren, I took this album to a luggage store in Koreatown (not exactly the airport, but similar), where I suggested to the owner that I would only bag-shop to theme music. He told me to ""go fuck,"" so I went and listened in the alley. First things first: Herren insists that this is not an ""actual"" album. I have no idea what this means, but critical preemptions aside, Security Screenings is a marked improvement over last year's directionless Surrounded by Silence, which missed its mark of collaborative opus. Songs here wander but don't get lost, the subtlety of their direction possibly a result of Herren's humbling tumble from avant garde b-boy to laptop nomad. The shuffling ephemera of his previous work is again evident, as are the melodies that abstained from the bizarre street anthems of Silence. Whether recording under the guise of Prefuse, Savath, Delarosa, or Piano Overlord, Scott Herren is at his most listenable when his influences are tangled, not strewn about. ""Weight Watching"", which begins with a chopped sample of Mobb Deep's Prodigy, unfolds into a kaleidoscope of clanging knives and Herren's signature oil-and-water synth flourishes. It's the one beat on Security Screenings that could support an MC, but Herren smartly keeps the sampled P on announcer status. And that's the difference here: Herren is measured. He may reach at times, but never enough to fall off. Striking another sharp contrast to Surrounded by Silence, Security Screenings' two guests actually contribute the album's two finest moments. Four Tet's appearance on ""Creating Cyclical Headaches"" sounds exactly as you might expect, a rambling FT break and bubbling keyboard scathed by Herren's free-noise, fading out to a plucked acoustic. It's possible that I may simply prefer Kieran Hebden's drums to Herren's, but Hebden can often be too prettily pastoral, which is why Herren's industrial grind makes for a welcome pair-up. TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, meanwhile, is given credit on ""We Leave You in a Cloud of Thick Smoke and Sleep Outro"", but his voice is sampled and layered until it merely becomes ambient drone. Still, this serves as a reminder that Herren is wholly capable of creating modest soundscapes from opportune moments, and an indication that the criticism of Silence's stargazing may have had some effect-- although I suppose we'll have to wait for his actual album to find out if anything has changed.","Latest from Scott Herren features guest appearances by Four Tet, TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, and Mobb Deep's Prodigy, and finds the producer regaining some of the focus he lost on last year's Surrounded by Silence.

3 Dead People After the Performance,Damo Suzuki,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ccb1335d7bf1698eec/1:1/w_160/a0245e7a.gif,2006-02-05 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7842-3-dead-people-after-the-performance/,Ektro,"There are plenty of bands vying for shares of your attention-- bands competing to the be the loudest, the fastest, the boldest, the most visible. Damo Suzuki's Network is not among them. This live recording from Finland's Jyrock Festival in April 2003 prioritizes a dogged persistence above flash, slow immersion above quick accessibility-- its 50-odd minutes of unbroken, thematically repeating music sits dauntingly in one long track. 3 Dead People After the Performance isn't interested in winning you over; instead, it asks for a commitment. This isn't surprising coming from ex-Can frontman Damo Suzuki, whose music has always rewarded the long haul more than the sprint. This seems like a continuation of Can's Krautrock legacy, although it's really more of an attenuation-- while the long and fluidly shifting rhythmic and melodic lines are intact, Suzuki is no longer pushing at the boundaries of sonic acceptability. And while Can incorporated electronic music and dub into their languorous rock deconstructions, Damo Suzuki's Network seems to have nostalgically regressed into the rock idiom-- guitars, drums, bass, and vocals are the entire palette here. The music moves like a pendulum, swinging in an ever-increasing arc; the pendulum spinning hypnotically like a golden pocket-watch the size of a wrecking ball. You have to want to get into it; it's not going to do a little soft-shoe for you. As mentioned above, it rewards commitment. And what does this commitment disgorge? It disgorges gruff, unflashy vocals that mostly stay within the same murky register, reiterating melodic patterns throughout this register like a rudimentary signature. There's a garage-rock warmth to Suzuki's vocals, but their regularity bends them toward the robotic, and when he occasionally drops into a Cookie Monster croak, we're reminded, counterintuitively, of his humanity. It disgorges an athletic rhythm section that seethes and pulses with a minimum of fuss, the compact thrust amplifying the music's sense of inexorability. It disgorges rock guitars that move seamlessly between searing and cooling, between cerebral finagling and rude skronk, but rarely noodle. Indeed, for a record that sounds so excessive on paper, 3 Dead People After the Performance is the model of restraint, conveying its incantatory, slowly-unfolding force with the lightest gestures. If it lacks Can's visionary dishevelment, it bears all the marks of a musician decades at his craft-- quiet confidence and effortless poise.","The former Can member's latest is a live recording from a 2003 festival.

Stay in the Shade EP,José González,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c025eb335119a49ed343/1:1/w_160/b05f2e11.gif,2006-02-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3683-stay-in-the-shade-ep/,Hidden Agenda,"When José González's debut album, Veneer, began to catch on in 2005-- two years after it was first issued-- part of its magic involved the long journey the Swedish/Argentine singer-songwriter's recordings had made. With so much time elapsed between those recordings, it's a little disappointing that the follow-up, five-track EP Stay in the Shade, sounds mostly like more of the same. The tightly double-tracked vocal fjords and sinuous finger-picking remain, as do González's lyrics, which stick mostly to Nick Drake's strangely suggestive universals: ""It's warm in the blood/ Cold in the rain,"" he coos on erstwhile B-side ""Down the Hillside"", an incongruously chipper (for Gonzo) ditty about cemeteries. Another former flip, ""Sensing Owls"", slows the pace for a tralatitious take on mountaintops, coming-outs, and the lack of designated drivers. The biggest changes from Veneer are an increased use of hand percussion and less frequent bossa nova tinges, so hold onto your knitted hats. All along, González has been the rare singer-songwriter known more for a cover than for his, y'know, songwriting. The centerpiece of Veneer was his aching rendition of the Knife's ""Heartbeats"", which has since earned him fame and fortune by appearing in a Sony commercial and, subsequently, the UK top 10. His sequel of sorts, a cover of Kylie Minogue's ""Hand on Your Heart"", deserves credit for its steadfast straight-face, though by the end his earnestness, percussive guitar-playing and the dopey lyrics have him seeming more like a cuddly coffeehouse troubadour along the lines of Matt Wertz or Dave Barnes than a haunted lo-fi auteur. Put in terms of fellow coverman Mark Kozelek, of Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon, if ""Heartbeats"" was What's Next to the Moon then ""Hand on Your Heart"" is closer to Tiny Cities. Thing is, González's records are more aesthetic than songs. Eerie, stripped to the waist, and raining classical guitar; it's a fine style, and perfect for bringing the dance-oriented songs of the Knife and Kylie to audiences that otherwise might be loath to embrace them. But weightless João Gilberto-like singing and delicately plucked Drakeisms will only get González so far until his compositions catch up. A closing, untitled instrumental features remarkably humble, droning guitar-playing and funereal horns. A crowd chatters for its final two minutes, as if still waiting for something to begin.","Up-and-coming singer/songwriter follows his increasingly popular debut with this five-track EP, which features a Kylie Minogue cover.

The Life Pursuit,Belle and Sebastian,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26413d1975652138869/1:1/w_160/3824d08e.jpg,2006-02-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/639-the-life-pursuit/,Matador,"Every religion began as a cult. In their early years, Belle and Sebastian possessed near-totemic powers for their small but impassioned band of disciples, as fervent as the followers of similarly wistful, self-deprecating, and sometimes sexually conflicted artists like the Smiths, Felt, and Orange Juice a decade prior. The common sacrament was pop, with true believers bearing witness in their communal alienation, badges, battered cassettes, and fanclub memberships. The Scottish group only heightened that devotion by shrouding themselves in mystery-- not answering questions, not appearing in proper photographs, not available in stores. On sixth proper album The Life Pursuit, Belle and Sebastian want to teach the world to sing, in however imperfect harmony. Where the recent live re-recording of 1996's If You're Feeling Sinister draped their most appealing songs in apposite finery, the band's latest extends their newfound confidence to content as well as delivery, and stands as the finest full-length by Stuart Murdoch and his shifting collaborators since that distant pinnacle. About his early-90s recovery from chronic fatigue, Murdoch told a recent interviewer, ""Spirituality and songwriting were my crutches."" Spanning glam, soul, country, and 70s AM rock, this record is a deceptively wry, wickedly tuneful testament to the fragile beauty of faith, in deities as well as in pop. Belle and Sebastian seem to have found new life in their evolution from shy bedsit savants to showy pop adepts. The Life Pursuit's lavishness renders the burgeoning bubblegum of 2003's Trevor Horn-produced Dear Catastrophe Waitress merely transitional, rewarding the Job-like righteous after the trials of the band's mid-career disappointments. Recorded in Los Angeles with Tony Hoffer, who oversaw Beck's divisive Midnite Vultures, the album runs over with flute, horns, call-and-response vocals, and even a funky clavinet (on soul survivor ""Song for Sunshine""). The playing, meanwhile, is surprisingly chopsy, down to the breezy guitars and Hammond organs-- a far cry from the days when indie meant never having to say you tried. Faith, after all, takes work, and if in one sense The Life Pursuit is about belief in the redemptive power of music, it's also a manifestation thereof. On opener ""Act of the Apostle, Part One"", a girl with a seriously ill mother imagines an escape, plays the Cat Stevens hymn ""Morning Has Broken"", and contemplates an endless melody before stumbling upon the album's central question: ""What would I do to believe?"" Ostinato bass, splashy piano, and Sarah Martin's gentle harmonies point the way. Toward the end of the album's loose storyline, on ""For the Price of a Cup of Tea"", the heroine seeks solace in ""soul black vinyl,"" as Murdoch channels an irrepressible Bee Gees falsetto. In between the opener and ""Act of the Apostle, Part Two"", nine tracks later, The Life Pursuit sets aside the nascent narrative to offer several of Belle and Sebastian's catchiest pop songs yet. ""The Blues Are Still Blue"" and ""White Collar Boy"" both incorporate glossy T. Rex boogie, Murdoch delivering one of his most indelible hooks on the former and uttering an uncharacteristically soulful ""huh!"" on the latter. Early mp3 preview ""Another Sunny Day"" sounds more like earlier Belle and Sebastian, setting country/western guitar licks to a sunny but sad love song that ambles past soccer, midges, Eskimos, and haunted hearts. First single ""Funny Little Frog"" slyly relates a love that turns out to be from afar, tellingly comparing the feeling to a sound from the narrator's ""thro-at."" Sharing its efficient Motown guitar style is the lone Stevie Jackson contribution, ""To Be Myself Completely"", which happily holds its own, observing, ""To be myself completely/ I've just got to let you down."" Still, there's little to fault about this album's songcraft, and Murdoch is also at his best detailing some of his famously quirky characters. ""Sukie in the Graveyard"" makes room for a pristine guitar solo, organs, and horns in a loose, animated tale of a runaway. On melancholic centerpiece ""Dress Up in You"", Murdoch at first seems to be describing an encounter with a groupie, but ultimately is revealed to be singing from the point of view of a woman to a former rival-turned-star. Of course, the album also wrestles with the struggle to have faith in God. To be sure, Murdoch's Christian beliefs have been central to his songs since long before you could say ""Sufjan."" The religious references here have more in common on their face with the Godspell gab of Waitress's ""If You Find Yourself Caught in Love"" than the sardonically wrought church scenes of ""The State That I Am In"" or ""If You're Feeling Sinister"". Amid atypically fancy guitarwork and Martin's breathless scat on ""We Are the Sleepyheads"", Murdoch recalls, ""We talked about the things we read in Luke and John."" With the feel of Paul McCartney doing Tin Pan Alley, ""Act of the Apostles, Part Two"" finds Murdoch returning to the girl from the introduction. ""The bible's my tool/ There's no mention of school,"" he sighs, then merges the album's twin motifs: ""My Damascan Road's my transistor radio."" Converted to pop, she was converted to Jesus. Though the music may be even shinier and happier than on Waitress, the girl's religious impulses don't resolve themselves nearly so blithely. Midway through ""Part Two"", the album climaxes when she determines to find ""the face behind the voice"": Synths flutter like stomach butterflies as the melody from ""Part One"" returns and the young protagonist attempts to attend a church service, only to be told to ""bugger off."" Next she places her hopes in music alone, spending the night with a man who makes her ""the village joke."" Closer ""Mornington Crescent""-- named for a London Underground stop and a laughably complex strategy game-- sketches a final fall from grace, giving itself to sin and countrified guitars out of ""Wild Horses"". Only a few bands have managed to successfully reinvent themselves a half-dozen or so albums into their careers. Granted, Murdoch's is a very different group today than the one that caught the ears and hearts of pop-music zealots a decade ago, with different members and a newly unrestrained sound. ""Make a new cult every day,"" Murdoch once sang, but of course, Heaven's Gate and Waco compounds aren't for everyone. The Life Pursuit is a baroque pop cathedral, welcoming the faithful and newly converted alike. ","Spanning glam, soul, country, and '70s AM rock, the latest from the indie pop group is a deceptively wry, wickedly tuneful testament to the fragile beauty of faith, in deities as well as in pop.

Tanx / Zip Gun / Futuristic Dragon / Work in Progress,T. Rex,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7125e6ef95969320eb7/1:1/w_160/f9e58bd0.jpg,2006-02-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11846-tanx-zip-gun-futuristic-dragon-work-in-progress/,Wizard,"When Marc Bolan screams on ""Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys"", the closing song on 1973's Tanx, he nearly maxes out his mic's capacity to filter sound. Unlike on Electric Warrior and The Slider, he doesn't punctuate these songs with his constant stream of grunts and yeahs and uh-ahs, so on ""Left Hand Luke"" he sounds as if he's venting it all in one short, supreme outburst. And that's not even the end of the song, which continues for nearly four more minutes as Bolan and his back-up singers milk that gospel refrain for maximum rock grandiosity and project to the ballrooms on Mars. Definitely triumphant, that yelp is also a little unsettling. It sounds drunkenly desperate, perhaps predicting the artistic and commercial dry spell that would follow Tanx for almost four years, nearly through the end of Bolan's life. This stage of the T. Rex story-- which is chronicled by Rhino's set of eight double-disc reissues, of which these four are the second batch-- has a notorious downward trajectory, as if there was no other place to go after the dizzy heights of what is now persistently referred to as T. Rexstacy, that period during the 70s when Bolan seemed to personify every ideal of rock superstardom in England. Because he worked with the same basic elements in all his songs-- glam-psychedelic lyrics, glittery 50s rhythms, momentous riffs, midtempo grooves-- it's pretty obvious when Bolan isn't on, although it's often hard to pinpoint the problems. The best term I've been able to come up with is ""mojo,"" which could be broken further down into a formula of fame, drugs, and ego. Bolan's mojo was definitely working during the Tanx period-- look no further than the singles that preceded the album, which are collected as bonus tracks in this reissue. ""Children of the Revolution"" segues effortlessly from The Slider's cocksure stride into one of Bolan's biggest choruses, and ""20th Century Boy"" is a wallop of glam-punk that remains one of the best singles of the decade. Even so, Tanx proved a difficult album: Bolan was sparring with the other members of T. Rex, his popularity was dwindling, and his narcotic intake was rampant. Furthermore, he wrote all the material essentially in the studio, which wasn't his usual method. As a result, Tanx has a rushed feel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing: ""Mister Mister"" and ""Country Honey"" derive their jittery jump from their impromptu momentum, and the relatively mellow ""Electric Slim and the Factory Hen"" sounds offhandedly arty, its guitar coda swirling into the atmosphere. That song suggests one possible and intriguing direction in which Bolan might have gone with subsequent albums, but instead of subtle and subdued, he opted for the opposite extreme-- blunt American-style funk. 1974's Zinc Alloy was a bomb, and the following year Bolan's Zip Gun was the fallout. A purposeful return to the looser sound of Electric Warrior, Gun fires blanks. For all its directness, the album is mostly perfunctory, working some of the same sounds and ideas, but the results lack movement and liveliness; Bolan's mojo definitely wasn't working. Worse, he really doesn't sound invested in these songs. ""Precious Star"" even borrows its melody from Tommy James and the Shondells' ""Hanky Panky"", and ""Token of My Love"" cribs flagrantly from ""Sea of Love"". The grating ""Think Zinc"" is little more than a billboard from Bolan's previous album. Rougher and rawer, the alternate takes on the second disc vastly improve on these songs, bringing out a charmingly stiff boogie piano on ""Precious Star"" and the popping bass line on ""Light of Love"". If Zinc Alloy and Zip Gun are Bolan's creative nadir and reportedly the peak of his drug use, then 1976's Futuristic Dragon has enough winning moments to suggest an upturn (confirmed by his underrated final album, Dandy in the Underworld, in 1977). Ostensibly some sort of concept album on par with Ziggy Stardust, Dragon begins with a goofy-ass introduction/invocation that actually uses the word raiment unironically, and the instrumental ""Theme for a Dragon"" revives the concept briefly, albeit in title alone. With its canned crowd roar and anthemic riff, the song sounds like Bolan's failed attempt to write his own ""Rock and Roll Part 2"". Ultimately-- and thank god-- the dragon is nothing more than a red herring. Bolan is much more interested in jamming on songs like ""All Alone"", ""New York City"", and especially ""Calling All Destroyers"", and the songs' open-ended grooves rejuvenate the band, even on the bonus-disc alternate takes. Futuristic Dragon blows smoke on its second half, with songs like ""Sensation Boulevard"" and the schlock-disco ""Ride My Wheels"" derailing the first half's chugging momentum. Nevertheless, the album wins your sympathies: It's good enough to make you wish it were better. Rhino's reissues set concludes with Work in Progress, a two-disk collection of home recordings and studio outtakes. Unlike the bonus tracks on the album disks, these 55 songs, which span Bolan's post-Warrior career, were never released in any form (although ""Bolan's Zip Gun"" would lose its vocals to become ""Theme for a Dragon""). The first disk contains solo performances, mostly Bolan alone strumming his guitar and often adlibbing lyrics; the second and better disk contains studio tracks featuring a full band and back-up singers. Some of the songs are just Bolan screwing around with a riff or a phrase (""Reelin' & A-wheelin' & A-boppin' & A-Bolan"" is nothing but the title repeated over and over, which is more than enough), but most of these tracks are finished songs that reveal a voracious artist enamored with African American music, from blues (""Alligator Man"") and gospel (""Sky Church Music"") to r&b; (""Metropolis Incarnate"") and funk (""Lock into Your Love""), while nodding to his former folksiness (""Is It True?""). The overall tone is one of exuberant experimentation, and songs like ""Bust My Ball"" and ""Savage Beethoven"" have an unguarded glee missing from later albums. Conversely, Bolan's lack of self-seriousness, especially on the studio tracks, makes Work in Progress sound much more substantial than Zinc, Zip, or even Dragon. Ostensibly, these recordings weren't meant for public consumption, but I like to think Bolan knew in the back of his mind that these songs would come out eventually, that his stardom would demand it. At times Work in Progress sounds sly and secretive, as if he's using these songs to subvert his prevailing reputation as a glam Icarus, a rockstar cautionary tale. That fall from grace, however, is only part of the story. Representing roughly half of Bolan's entire output, these six albums and two comps collectively portray an incredibly complex and deeply flawed artist, but they completely omit his early career as half of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Until Rhino or some other label reissues that group's four albums-- hopefully in this same double-disk format, a reissue gold standard-- this story will lack the rise to balance Bolan's fall.",,8.3,
Fahrenheit 1/15 / Pt. II / Pt. III,Lupe Fiasco,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec75e6ef959693232d2/1:1/w_160/8d489d65.jpg,2006-02-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11749-fahrenheit-115-pt-ii-pt-iii/,self-released,"Seasons can be defined by micro-genres. In hip-hop, especially. In the wake of Summer '05's Houston gurgle and the Winter's critical crack-hop resurgence, there are many people hoping for a return to brighter, looser days this Spring. A rebirth of sorts, where something old is something new again. There's a palpable unrest on the Okayplayer Message Boards and elsewhere, blindly searching for a Native Tongues revival or at least something approximating Rawkus' dazzlingly brief resurrection of it half a decade later. There's probably only three ways you'd know much about next-of-Native-kin Lupe Fiasco: His exuberant guest spot on Kanye West's ""Touch the Sky"", the Chicago MC's regional skateboarder-seducing smash ""Kick, Push"", or the internet. But the pitch on him is as exhausting as it is cliché: Clever, conscious kid to save hip-hop from the perils of bling kings and criminal-minded malcontents. If you approach this multi-layered, Shawn Carter-approved young artist's music with that kind of withering outlook on hip-hop, you're liable to be disappointed. There aren't enough Q-Tips in the world to clear that crevice. What Lupe does offer is a canny array of wordplay and an ear for snappish production. This group of mixtapes is a collection of freestyles and originals that comprise Fahrenheit 1/15, named for a corner in his neighborhood, and read like a trek through his life: Islam, geekdom, resistance to sinning, local turbulence, political unrest. One of Lupe's gifts is his malleability; he sounds as comfortable spitting hard, metaphysical poetics over Nas' ""Thief's Theme"" as doing acrobatics over chipmunked ""Revenge of the Nerds"" theme music. On Part 1 Fiasco samples his Chicago forebear's ""Jesus Walks"" for an extended treatise, which opens with a traditional prayer and includes some shots at Ignorant America's perceptions of his muslim beliefs. (""Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader."") In an act of aggrandizement he places two roughneck freestyles after his faith-based initiative. On the first he chirps, ""You far from the hood like limousine trunks."" On the second, over J-Kwon's ""Hood Hop"", he sums up the writing and recording process in 72 seconds, while also cleaning up some local melodrama. ""Knockin at the Door"" is the sort of full-bodied production Lupe excels with; it allows him to wrap his Chi-Ali-style syllable construction around it. In all, Part 1 is chockablock with revelatory verses, but it's also limited by the boundaries mixtapes create. He doesn't always spread his wings. Part II shows a marked improvement in his rubbery flow and storytelling abilities, but is again dragged down by obvious ""Still Tippin""/""Dear Summer""/""Sittin Sidewayz"" freestyle-flips. Part III is kind of a gag, an EP-style goof wherein Lupe rocks over beats from Gorillaz's Demon Days. It's basically a lark, but amplifies Danger Mouse's sometimes derided stylings into something more fruitful. At nearly two-and-a-half hours of music, the Fahrenheit series is a breezy introduction to the Chicago emcee. But with Lupe's debut full-length, Food and Liquor, due this summer it seems obvious he's holding out on us. Can he write an ""Electric Relaxation"" or a ""Ms. Fat Booty""? ""Kick, Push"" is a start, but it's still unclear how capable he is of converting good will into good songs.","Rising Chicago emcee and could-be disciple of Rawkus primes for his debut LP with a series of sharp mixtapes, including an EP that only uses beats from Gorillaz's Demon Days.

Last Night Becomes This Morning,Swearing at Motorists,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f8ea9e61561daa5271/1:1/w_160/97864ae6.jpg,2006-02-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7651-last-night-becomes-this-morning/,Secretly Canadian,"It was at least four years ago when I first caught Dave Doughman's two-man operation Swearing at Motorists, the first of three bands on the bill, playing to a mostly empty London club. Doughman's wiry enthusiasm and exaggerated crooning was met with indifference, and as a last-ditch effort, he pulled out a song that he ""wrote during his boyhood days in Manchester."" His languid, skeletal cover of ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" just...bombed, spectacularly, worse than any supposed crowd concession I'd seen before. A few two-minute tracks, half-hearted yowls, and overcompensating heel-clicking leaps later, Doughman and his drummer receded from the stage to little fanfare. I admired Doughman's chutzpah enough to pick up the band's surprisingly consistent This Flag Signals Goodbye, to stick with it through to the solipsistic slow numbers to blare its scrappy, unadorned anthems. The follow-up is Last Night Becomes This Morning, and it's armed with a bevy of clever song titles and an intertextual suggestion from Doughman likening the record to a struggling indie musician's Running on Empty, songs about maintaining the touring-band lifestyle in the face of apathy. While I'd love to say this is the album that breaks the holding pattern, Last Night holds a palm full of surprises and otherwise stretches the underdog charm a little thin. The only atmosphere Last Night conjures is isolation; the only emotional setting is defeat. Hell, it opens with a song called ""Losing the Battle, Losing the War"". Even numbers that run up the party flag, such as ""Waterloo Crescent"", sound deflated somehow. If you're gonna set yourself up to love this record, you'll have to bring considerable patience and savor every small detail Doughman tosses out as lifelines to his songs. Dig the vintage organ tones, the sneaky 10-second pre-chorus on ""Timing Is Everything"", that song's trumpets and piano-- always one at a time, however, as if he's sprinting across the studio to finish each part. Still, ""Timing"" is the closest to a full band sound that Last Night gets. Most songs are spiced up through either carefully applied double-tracked vocals (""Slave to the Kettle"" and the brief but near-perfect lullaby ""Done in a Hurry""), or with overbearing empty-studio echo that recall a sparsely attended performance and reinforce the crushing loneliness of life on the road, maaaaaan (""This is Not How Forever Begins"", ""Time Zones and Area Codes"", and ""Ten Dollars""). Which is fine; I couldn't think of an approach that suits Swearing at Motorists better. This Flag Signals Goodbye had songs, though, with arrangements and melodies that lived and breathed on their own regardless of lyrics. The tracks on Last Night serve the theme before all else and, barring a few bold highlights, skimp on the rest.","Clever song titles and intertextuality color the latest from this Secretly Canadian indie band.

Plastic Explosives,The Caribbean,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a528b1335d7bf1698b2a/1:1/w_160/68a24821.jpg,2006-02-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1310-plastic-explosives/,Hometapes,"""Americana"" is a word frequently applied to music that somehow feels connected to traditional Appalachian folk, blues, and country, genres we tend to think of as quintessentially American. It seems, though, that in the past half-century, the essence of American-ness has changed-- or rather, expanded-- to the point where the word Americana only captures a tiny part of what makes American life and culture distinctive. I'm not suggesting that we redefine a semi-useful critical tag, but I'd like to posit that the Caribbean's music is a sort of Americana, albeit a different sort than we're used to. The simple fact is that in 50 years, the stuff that this band sings about-- office supplies, airport security, long-distance correspondence, and dayjob malaise-- will likely be more central to American life than coal mining, farming, and church. That's if they're not already. Songs about crime, another staple of Americana, will probably still resonate far and wide, and the Caribbean simply updates that, from murder ballads to small-time drug production and white-collar dishonesty. The D.C. band wraps its tales of modern life in a musical cocktail that arranges piles of instruments into a constantly shifting mix. Guitars, marimbas, beatboxes, banjos, drums, violins, and accordions share air with turntables, radios and samplers, which add a touch of modern glitch to the otherwise smooth, spacious arrangements. Producer Chad Clark keeps all these elements from stepping on each other, giving the band a roomy sound that comes across like an alternate-universe Death Cab. Michael Kentoff's soft, Ira Kaplan-ish vocals wander through these elements like one person through a towering city, as if awed by everything they see and hoping not to get lost. This fact and the band's singularly odd way with lyrics make Plastic Explosives nearly impossible to sing along to-- none of the songs are arranged in convenient verse-chorus-verse packages, instead flowing from thought to thought in mostly complete sentences. It can get awkward at times-- try putting a melody to ""As we ripped out our networks, I kept it in mind: Save the mirror or else pretty soon you'll find you can't see/ You can't hear"" and see how far you get. Kentoff's lyrics are at their best on ""The Truth Hurts Jamie Green"", which that tells the story of a girl adrift with just a few fractured images, the best being the last: ""A voice assumed buried rang on another line."" The songs here have an uncanny flow from one to the next, to the point where they feel indelibly joined, a feeling heightened by the little sketchy instrumentals that cushion them from each other like sonic packing peanuts. After three albums and a couple of EPs, the Caribbean sound at home in this strange little white-collar rock place they've built for themselves. It's the folk music of the new American service economy.","This D.C. band wraps its tales of modern life-- office supplies, airport security, long-distance correspondence, and dayjob malaise-- in constantly shifting arrangements.

Eccentric Soul: The Deep City Label,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84113d19756521395eb/1:1/w_160/9cf23e5b.jpg,2006-02-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2079-eccentric-soul-the-deep-city-label/,Numero Group,"During the 1960s, it was difficult to find a moderate-sized American city that didn't have an independent soul label pumping out singles destined for thrift-store obscurity. Numero Group's incomparable Eccentric Soul series has already documented two such labels, Chicago's Bandit and Columbus, Ohio's Capsoul; with the third volume, the label shines a light on Miami's Deep City imprint. What distinguishes Deep City from most of its mid-60s peers is that, while its own output fell on deaf ears outside of Miami, several people involved with the enterprise eventually found success in the music history. Deep City essentially laid the groundwork for Henry Stone's T.K. imprint, honed Willie Clarke's production skills, and discovered Betty Wright, Paul Kelly, and Clarence ""Blowfly"" Reid. The label's Criteria Studio also played host to giants like Wilson Pickett, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin-- closer brushes with fame than most shoestring-budget soul labels enjoyed. Many of the musicians who played on these recordings cut their teeth in Florida A&M; University's ""Incomparable Marching 100"" band, and you can hear that discipline in the comp's solid backing tracks, wicked horn arrangements, and complex drumming. For their parts, Clarke and label co-founder Johnny Pearsall were moonlighters, working at a local middle school (Clarke taught art, Pearsall was an administrator), while arranger Arnold Albury was a music teacher and Incomparable Marching 100 alum. From the beginning, Deep City had the potential for national success, hitching its wagon to should-have-been-a-star Helene Smith. Smith had a sweet, rangey voice not dissimilar to Mary Wells, and her five songs here reveal a remarkably developed talent. In particular, ""You Got to Do Your Share"" and the spacey ""I Am Controlled By Your Love"", with its chinking guitars, deliciously nuanced lead, and heavenly backing vocals, deserved a much-larger audience. Those backing vocals were provided by the Moovers, an amazing harmony soul combo who crop up several times on the compilation, most notably on ""One Little Dance"" and ""Someone to Fulfill My Needs"", the latter a spooky crawler full of great harmonies and sumptuously deep bass. The previously unreleased Moovers track ""Darling I'll Go"", lifted by Numero Group from acetate, kicks off with an intro that sounds like a cousin to the Skatalites' ""Addis Ababa"", offering the starkest indication of the label's proximity to Jamaica. Though the occasional Latin influence does pop up in the rhythm section, Motown and the then-burgeoning sound of Southern soul are far more dominant touchstones. The Southern soul influence is most apparent on Johnny K. Killens & The Dynamites' driving proto-funk cut ""I Don't Need Help"", which features drier production than most of what surrounds it. More difficult to classify is the opening cut, Them Two's ""Am I a Good Man"". The song is a smoky masterpiece of tortured soul, with a huge bassline pulling it through its various movements while Smith's ghostly backing vocals coax the dual lead vocalists to a cold sweat. The song also makes it clear how superb Numero Group's remastering job is-- the production is traceable to its time, but the sound quality and depth of field is thoroughly modern. Coupled with the extensive liners and photographs, this is what sets Numero apart from other reissue labels. The final chapter of the brief Deep City story-- the label only lasted from 1964 to 1968-- is a classic music industry falling-out tale. By 1967, Pearsall was married to Smith, who was enjoying her status as Miami's queen of soul, and the introduction of Betty Wright to the label's roster, such as it was, did not go over well. The tracks Wright waxed for Deep City are uniformly astounding, her voice brimming with passion, and had personal politics not interfered, she and Smith would have made a formidable pair. The result of a prospective competition between the two for supremacy at the label is another tantalizing what-if. As it happened, Pearsall refused to work with Wright, and Reid (who wrote, produced, and played sessions for Deep City) exited with Clarke and Wright, leaving Pearsall to finish the label's run with a Helene Smith LP that collected all of her sides. For Pearsall and Smith, it was the end of their involvement in music, while many of the other players in the Deep City story went on to success in the disco era or remained active as session players in Miami. Though their paths ultimately diverged, the music they were responsible for at Deep City was truly among the best small-label soul of the 60s, and here it's well-preserved, presented in beautiful packaging with remastered sound, and for once, receiving national distribution.","Another tremendous reissue from Chicago's Numero Group, this is the third in the Eccentric Soul series, this time collecting the best from Miami's Deep City label.

Everything Ecstatic 2,Four Tet,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0ceb335119a49ecfde/1:1/w_160/1ef616d6.gif,2006-02-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3169-everything-ecstatic-2/,Domino,"By most accounts, Blondie's 1979 Eat to the Beat was the first album to be released with an accompanying music video for every song. Over the next two decades, scattered vanguards like Sonic Youth tried the same ploy, but the last few years have seen a boom in the audio/multi-media realm. Vying to offer consumers bigger bangs in an effort to compete with the all-powerful interweb, ambitious acts-- from the Super Furry Animals (Rings Around the World) to 50 Cent (The Massacre) to Death Cab and their planned web-only video bonanza for Plans-- are utilizing sound and vision to hook listeners' ADD-addled ears and eyes. Attractive in theory, these ""video albums"" usually don't connect thanks to a dearth of great short-film ideas and/or puny funding. They can also be artistically tyrannical, taking power away from the listener by forcing cemented images upon their psyche instead of allowing them to draw individual visual conclusions. This latter drawback is especially consequential for a lyric-less artist like Four Tet, whose flighty electrorganic hybrids lend themselves to an even greater amount of consumer interpretation. To wit, this unnecessary addendum to last year's lukewarm Everything Ecstatic LP, a set featuring a DVD album along with a five-song, half-hour bonus CD of remixes and newbies. Both discs dilute their source material, often dimming its dense musical magnetism with annoying, artsy pretensions. Kieran Hebden's previous videos span from haunting and brilliant (the ghostly, animated ""My Angel Rocks Back and Forth"") to barely watchable (marching band-a-thon ""As Serious As Your Life""), so it's unsurprising that the quality of the clips on Films fluctuate wildly. The album's best song, ""Smile Around the Face"", is graciously coupled with the DVD's best video. One of Hebden's warmest moments to date is affectionately brought to the screen via a bravura performance by British actor Mark Heap. The entirety of the day-in-the-life short focuses on Heaps' head as he falls down bus stairs, see-saws with his toddler daughter, and finally sinks into a soothing bath. Ostensibly wearing a camera harnessed to his person (the same magnetizing technique recently employed to great effect by Pi director Darren Aronofsky), the whole thing is a fascinating face study with the middle-aged thespian's worn creases and bluish bruises giving the camera gobs to work with. Heap manages to convey the heartbreak of a divorced dad, the workman's daily grind, and, lastly, the song's titular relieved expression with startling believability, making his nameless centerpiece a rare music video character worth caring about. Yet most of the DVD's other pieces don't tap into the sparkling melancholy prevalent in Hebden's calculated compositions, instead vying for silly art-house tomfuckery. ""Sleep, Eat Food, Have Visions"" is an eight-minute slog filled with escalating mind-melt noize and parsed pandemonium. It does not rank among Four Tet's best moments. Couple it with a video starring orange-faced dunces dressed as insects and a pink-painted Hebden crazily licking a lollipop in the shape of a panda head and, well, it's really just a miracle I watched it straight through once. Confoundingly directed by the same man, Woof Wan-Bau, behind the striking ""My Angel Rock Back And Forth"" clip, ""Visions"" stinks like a how-to for art-school assholes. Poorly filmed and oblique beyond the slightest comprehension, it's an ugly piece of wannabe high-art filmmaking. The better-looking ""High Fives"" short also relies too much on seemingly random symbolism to draw out the song's twinkling mystery, with a magical droplet of water causing onlookers to develop a second set of eyes directly under their usual pair. Worst of all, these failed stabs devalue their accompanying music by locking them in with inferior visuals that are tough to shake. The package's Part 2 is no better than your typical after-the-fact album add-on. Featuring a bottom-feeding melody straight out of Frogger, Ecstatic's two-minute ""Turtle Turtle Up"" never seemed worthy of a 16-minute stretch-out but that's what we get anyway. The EP's one keeper, ""Watching Wavelength"", pumps sonar-blip sound science slowly building into a floating piece of Fennesz-esque distilled distortion. With the song's mechanized core naturally flowing out of a thick murk, it's the type of Four Tet song that forces you to follow him. On record, Ecstatic closer ""You Were There With Me"" is a sparse exercise in chiming minimalism that hints at a quaint optimism, which is beatifically defined in its video counterpart. Directed by Hebden and filmed with a hand-held camera, the simplistic work finds his significant other spinning and jumping-- arms flailing like streamers-- in various locations. That's it. From a waterfall to the beach to a forest to a busy New York City street to a record store to the middle of the crowd at last year's Pitchfork-curated Festival, she twirls. It's loose, joyous, and ecstatic while its sly splendor still offers airs of in-between inexplicability. And, for those same reasons, it's a noticeable anomaly.","This companion piece to Kieran Hebden's 2005 album features film shorts commissioned for each of that album's 10 tracks as well as a 35-minute bonus CD of new material.

There's a fucking piano on this album, just saying. In fairness Delay's on the powerbook so we're talking slick beyond slick here, which helps the Dolls' smooth jazz schlock go down easier than (for example) a bag of snakes. Never has Delay's Finnishness been his only selling point, as coffeeshop assholes round the world will surely feel the record's cold blistery tundrascopic soundscapthropic vibeism thingie thang, and most will enjoy sharing that revelation with the rest of us. To be honest though I can only take so much of the scattershot drums + fractured melodies=rhythmic complexity party before I start feeling the cold too-- chills, pneumonia. To say nothing of AGF's spoken word riffs and humorless insights re pop stars (she actually says ""pop stars"") and the ""New York City lights"" (which she rhymes with ""New York City life"")-- these count among the inanities here, which are countless. As for Delay's four-track full-length, it's 65 straight minutes of ice-blue longtones and stainless steel clinks, but it definitely clears the air when you need it to. Infinite to no fault, the quarters see Delay blowing out his typically nervous drum programming till the track movements are glacial, but never letting too many moments go by without some sort of surprise to prick us awake. Closer to Mutilia and Anima at the beginning, by the end Delay has given up on the rigor and settles just below Uusitalo dub. ""The Third Quarter"" sports vaguely hip-hop beats and handclaps on the ups, then ""The Four Quarter"" finally gives way to the LP's only hot dance passage, though nobody's supposed to dance-dance to it.

Grumpy people call it the worst sort of recycling (last night's Cheez Whiz, microwaved), as if dance music hasn't been pulling gems from that mine since forever. But the track works, stomping beautifully through the commercial universe: Friday-night megamixes on the top-40 station, stereo demo discs at Best Buy, end-of-night hugs between the older guys at the less-cool gay bar. A few months later: We get mix after mix of other people's hi-NRG takes on squishy 80s ballads, right down to Cutting Crew. Moral of story: Drunk people like to do a lot of things, but ""dance"" and ""emote along with familiar songs"" are both near the top of the list. Stuff like this takes shortcuts to both, and grumps who imagine the phenomenon is limited to shopping malls have another think coming. Diplo and Hollertronix have been known to do indie versions of the same thing, bulking up the beats behind hip staples from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Talking Heads, the Cure, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Rock bands release full-length remix albums. Interpol hook up with Arthur Baker. People have been pointing this out since 2001: Folks nowadays want to dance and listen to indie at the same time, and low-budget mashups and endless spins of ""Blue Monday"" don't seem to be cutting it. Yeah, well: Whether it's DJ Sammy action or dancing-to-indie, there are better ways to fill the gap than Future Retro, a discful of middling remixes of hip-friendly 80s-ish tracks from the WEA back catalog-- many of which were not exactly in need of reconfiguring. To their credit, these revamps are largely pretty competent, and they're mostly ""deep"" mixes, putting together all-new, all-functional, all-modern backings for the familiar vocals to migrate to. Some people will have professional reasons for needing that kind of translation-- say, commercial DJs who for some reason want a version of Erasure's ""A Little Respect"" they can work into electronic house sets. Some of them are even decent on their own. Elite Force's chunky-funk take on ""White Lines"" is a solid track without too much connection to the original. The Crystal Method take ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and Richard X takes Yaz's ""Situation""; both know well enough to add a little energy and then leave things alone. But for you, the end-user listener: Exactly what was missing from dancing to Erasure in the first place? (Or ""Situation"", or the Cure's ""The Walk"", or ""Bizarre Love Triangle?"") The limited usefulness only points to the problem with the all-function translations here: Hardly any of them do much to bring anything new to the material, anything beyond dressing them up for an ever-so-slightly different social occasion. Some of them can't even manage that very well: Jaded Alliance make a harmonic mess of ""A Little Respect"", Alphaville's ""Forever Young"" gets a cheeseball post-""Heaven"" treatment, and the mix of INXS's ""Need You Tonight"" on here bugs me on levels I'm not even prepared to plumb. The treats at the end-- a big motorik drone over B-Movie's ""Nowhere Girl"", and church-organ cut-up fun with Morrissey's ""Suedehead""-- are way too little, way too late, and may even only sound good by comparison.

Harpoon,Larkin Grimm,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02bea9e61561daa7b8a/1:1/w_160/e28a816a.jpg,2006-02-01 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3689-harpoon/,Secret Eye,"If nothing else, Larkin Grimm's solo debut, Harpoon, stands as quiet testament to how quickly the alien can transform into the familiar. Had this collection appeared just a few short years ago, Grimm's idiosyncratic form of rustic Appalachian folk might've sounded like a garbled transmission from another century, if not another world. As it stands, however, Harpoon is instead at risk of seeming downright commonplace, submerged beneath the onrushing tide of similarly constructed free-folk deviations. Yet it would be a mistake to overlook Grimm's wondrous, exotic creations simply due to the unfortunate timing of her album's arrival, just as it would be to dismiss this transfixing album as the work of a carpetbagger. Based in Providence, R.I., Grimm is a former member of the Dirty Projectors-- information that does little to prepare the listener for the delicate, highly stylized folk of Harpoon. Guiding her way with little more than guitar, dulcimer, and multi-tracked vocals, Grimm here quilts together Born Heller's icy, backwoods songcraft, Jana Hunter's homespun, lo-fi shimmer, and the ecstatic vocal peaks of Christina Carter. Thanks in part to Sophie Dixon's ornate, hand-drawn artwork, Harpoon also bears marked resemblance to the gothic folk of musician and comic artist Dame Darcy. And though the album is comprised entirely of original material, the influence of Grimm's roots in the Georgia foothills frequently creep through, lending the music a deep-set, handed-down fiber that sounds at once staunchly traditional yet still somehow quite unearthly. On ""Pigeon Food"", Grimm puts down a melody as pure and ancient as rainwater; sung in the sweet, artless manner of someone out hanging wash on the line, with only her eccentric multi-tracked chorus to date it as a modern recording. Things soon come decidedly more unraveled on the lengthy ""Future Friend"", when her layered encircling vocals descend like a flock of barn swallows and carry off the back-porch. Stranger still is ""Harpoon Baptism"", a incisive portrait of heartsick longing that eventually culminates with Grimm channeling various animal noises, witch cackles, and spirited inhuman howls. Music this singular and possessed seems to demand lyrics to match, but unfortunately the slim narratives of Grimm's ballads and ill-starred romantic chronicles often fail to meet the mark. Cryptic, out-of-time pieces like the opening ""Entrance"", shudder to a halt behind such earthbound lines as ""I would follow him anywhere he wants me to/ And I would sing for him in a crowd of New York hipsters."" Throughout the album, Grimm's lyrics are too consistently forlorn and lovestruck to doubt their sincerity, and as such she proves able to deliver them with an extraordinary breadth of conflicting passions. One only hopes that next time her themes prove ageless enough to better equal the live-wire magic inherent within her radiant music.","Solo album from former Dirty Projectors member is an idiosyncratic take on rustic Appalachian folk.

Spirit Walk,Steve Reid Ensemble,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30e9d034d5c69bf2d2c/1:1/w_160/2a7c2ef6.gif,2006-02-01 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6931-spirit-walk/,Soul Jazz,"Looking back at where Steve Reid has been is just as intriguing as looking ahead to where he's going. A visionary drummer with a CV dating back to the early 1960s, Reid has an epic backstory that would make crate diggers swoon: Self-taught Motown session player. In-house drummer at the Apollo Theater. Jailed during Vietnam as a conscientious objector. Member of Sun Ra's Arkestra. A teenaged sojourn through Africa resulting in a stint with Fela. Four roiling, passionate records-- limited to just 1,000 pressings each, filed under the loosely-defined kosmigroov genre-- released on his own Bronx-based Mustevic Sound label from 1975 -79. After Reid's 20-plus years off the map, it's a minor miracle that the spelunkers at Soul Jazz unearthed his Rhythmatism and Nova albums for reissue in 2004. And it's nothing short of divine intervention that Reid, who now makes his home in Switzerland, recently found a kindred spirit in Four Tet's Kieren Hebden. The two have been collaborating since a series of European performances in early 2005. Hebden plays a minor yet important role in Reid's latest, Spirit Walk: As part of an eight-man ensemble that includes Reid's propulsive drums, tenor, soprano, and bass saxophones, a vast array of keyboards, and upright bass, Hebden's interjections add luminous filigree to a sound galvanized by bottom-end groove. It's a next-gen enrichment of Reid's earlier work, much of which was marked by acoustic instrumentation and less ornate, more syncopated spaciousness. That kind of digital detailing renders Spirit Walk at once timeless and totally in the moment, stretching out towards jazz's greatest potential. Take the steamrolling ""Lions of Juda""-- a track Reid revisits from Nova. Where the previous version was played with hectic urgency, this one rumbles along with a commanding, marshal steadiness. Hebden stitches a glitchy silver lining around the rest of the band, his minimal electronic deviance emphasizing rather than obscuring the music's sanguine, organic heart. ""Bridget"" and ""Which One?"" are likewise illuminated, while bellicose bass sax argues with bubbly electric organ or righteous soprano horn, landing somewhere between Afrobeat's dark march, Bitches Brew-style incantation, and Yesterday's New Quintet's streetwise shuffle. Melody occasionally takes the reigns, even as Reid's percussive cantor and bassist John Edward's hearty upright bass stay the course. Album opener ""Lugano"", with its reverent alto line, or the gurgling, tumbling staggers of 23-year-old Russian keysman Boris Netsvetaev on the apt-named ""For Coltrane"", both highlight sweet, yearning progressions. These are songs that could've come from Pharaoh Sanders' Karma period, minus the discord, or Trane's Crescent-era recordings, but Reid tethers these spiritual flights with a rhythmic root that's both supple and strong. Spirit Walk's one misstep is ""Drum Story"", an overlong, spoken-word ode to the history of percussion recited by Reid himself. There's no need for hindsight here-- thanks to its coy foreplay with Four Tet, Reid's music is going nowhere but forward.","Soul Jazz release features the first studio collaborations between the veteran jazz drummer and Four Tet.

Achso,Ricardo Villalobos,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a982c0084474cd0c104e/1:1/w_160/23a1bf1d.gif,2006-02-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8508-achso/,Cadenza,"Here's a little fact to ponder: Google tells me the words ""Ricardo Villalobos"" appear in six out of the eight ""Month in Techno"" features Big Phil Sherburne penned for this site in the year 2005. I can't find anyone else who approaches that. Not Dominik ""K-hole"" Eulberg. Not Michael ""International DJ Superstar"" Mayer. Not Hans-Peter ""Space Disconaut"" Lindstrom. Apparently in 2005, the geist of techno swung to Mr. Villalobos, brittle zeit. As the person most responsible for ""ketamine house,"" sweet Ricardo has been chasing his personal white rabbit down any number of holes for the last few years now. (On record, of course.) Alcachofa redrew ""jazzy house"" with a broken piece of charcoal. Thè au Harem d'Archiméde approached drooling stasis through geologic repetitions. And in 2005 he seemed to have given up on the album format entirely, producing a series of singles that stretch right to the lip of the vinyl, unafraid of what goes on over the edge. Mssr. Sherburne has already commented that if you could get more than 15 minutes of decent sound on a vinyl single, Villalobos would just keep going and going and going. Slipping out in the last weeks of December and at just a hair under 50 minutes, Achso is not an EP. The only thing that has kept it from receiving the same attention as Villalobos' two albums is form: a vinyl double-pack in an era where many music hipsters have given up even CDs. This is a shame because it might be his best work. ""Ichso"" opens as a rustle of hi-hats, clipped male grunts, and a snaking, almost Native American melody. Less than a minute in, a more sure-footed and jacking rhythm drops. The melody becomes a chiming guitar pricking a handful of nylon notes, and back again. Then, after two minutes, he does the wholly unexpected and throws in a breakbeat-like kick, turning this swirl of tiny things nearly club-ready. A distorted chord clangs around five minutes in as the drums become more agitated and the guitar peals. Everything drops out at around seven minutes for a stretch of bass and drum that sounds like desiccated UK garage strafed by intermittent Death Star fire. By minute nine it's a sea of percussive onomatopoeia as the melody reappears. Then the whole thing slows to half time until fade out, a Timbaland rhythm pattern happily chewed on by Perlon grubs and mites. That's just the first track. And so it goes. ""Duso"" strings Orientalist guitar runs (that sound like they were recorded with an underwater microphone) through a now trademark Villalobos percolating groove, heavy on the hollow kick drum and gurgling off-beats. Halfway through he treats us to elephants stomping bubble wrap in an empty warehouse. Rusty screen doors shudder in the wind and dot matrix printers crank. ""Erso"" is a chiming sea of fizzy chirps and ISDN line noise like breakers against a shoreline. (Or, if I wanted to be reductive, a dancefloor Autechre.) At the four-minute mark, everything gets farty and it's the most cheerful thing the man has put his name to. ""Sieso"" is a percussive monster: Sizzles like grease popping from a frying pan, big ugly hammering klangs, contact mic'd dragonfly flutter, all held together by the thinnest Aphexian lunar melody that gorgeously modulates throughout. Patterns are constantly reshuffled, new ticks and tocks and tsssh's. More beats (or beat sounds) per bar than some dance producers manage in an entire career. Achso is minimal because it doesn't announce itself with big riffs or overt melodies, and it's ""minimal"" because that's where it gets slotted in stores. But there's more going on in these four sides than the entire Get Physical catalog. I have no idea if these records would work in any club context; my instincts tell me no. But in a genre that often holds up anonymity as an aesthetic virtue, Villalobos records are as immediately recognizable as a Stereolab single, as considered as Morton Feldman, and as expansive as John Coltrane. Say whatever you will: He's the first true genius 21st century techno has produced.","Latest from the Chilean producer, one of the central figures in minimal techno, is technically an EP, but its four percolating tracks stretch to nearly 50 minutes.

Africa Unite: The Singles Collection,Bob Marley & the Wailers,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c374eb335119a49ed6f2/1:1/w_160/73afa938.jpg,2006-02-01 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5673-africa-unite-the-singles-collection/,Island,"Bob Marley's Legend is probably the one album most likely to be found in the collections of people who only own 10 CDs. It's time-honored and universal, spanning almost all backgrounds, professions, and upbringings, and those who gave up on following music before the compact disc era are as likely to have a copy lying around as those who just got into the Velvets at school last year. Legend, for many, is reggae; the genre begins with ""Could You Be Loved"" and ends with ""Jamming"". But as weathered and worn-out as this compilation has become-- and man, am I tired of it-- it didn't attain its stature by force of marketing. Marley wrote accessible, all-embracing songs, had a radiant voice, and backed himself with great bands. The problem with Legend is not that people love it, but what that love means to Island Records, and how it translates to Africa Unite, their recent repackaging of the compilation. Eleven of Legend's 14 songs appear here, meaning those whom this collection is directly aimed at already own most of it. Granted, beyond those 11 are nine new cuts for the casual fan, but then two of these are simply slight remixes that few will find enticing. Black-Eyed Peas' will.i.am, for example, was given the nod to update the compilation's title song, but his clumsy programmed drums are mixed much too high and fail to deliver the intended effect of bringing the track up to date. ""Stand Up Jamrock"" finds Ashley Beedle mashing up ""Get Up Stand Up"" with brief snippets of Damian Marley's ""Welcome to Jamrock"", which may make some sense thematically but drains life from both tunes. If anything, it's a reminder that, yeah, ""Jamrock"" would sound pretty good right about now. Africa Unite's biggest draw-- and likely the only real incentive for its release-- is the new song ""Slogans"", which was pieced together ""Free as a Bird""-style by adding a full band to an acoustic demo Marley cut in a hotel room in 1979. ""Slogans"" is a nice song, and its backing arrangements, assembled under the direction of Stephen and David Marley, integrates it well into the catalog. The production faithfully replicates the careful (some would say overly slick) studio sound of his late-70s years at Island, with Eric Clapton adding some restrained fills that threaten to get in the way but never quite do. But even if this material tacked onto Africa Unite's second half serves as the compilation's impetus, the disc's first track points toward the real area of exploration for Marley neophytes. This compilation is the first ever to combine pre-Island recordings with the material that made Marley a household name. And the opening ""Soul Rebel"", which Bob and the Wailers cut with Lee ""Scratch"" Perry at the boards, hasn't lost a bit of its earthy appeal. The Complete Upsetter Singles is the place those made curious by familiar Marley hits should look next. Download ""Slogans"" somewhere-- it's worth the 99 cents-- and then set your sights for Scratch-produced sides like ""Small Axe"" and ""Mister Brown"".","Twenty-track compilation repeats most of frathouse standard Legend and includes a new track cobbled together from 1979 acoustic recordings as well as remixes from Ashley Beedle and will.i.am.

Oasis of Whispers,Glen HallLee RanaldoWilliam Hooker,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c18fea9e61561daa7dd4/1:1/w_160/ddcef6da.gif,2006-01-31 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4032-oasis-of-whispers/,Alien8,"Sometimes it's hard to drag yourself out of bed for records like these. Another muttering, banging, squealing five-year-old live jazz album from Buffalo, NY, played by the pros, Oasis of Whispers is a September 2001 performance that finds Canadian multi-instrumentalist Glen Hall blowing through an assortment of saxes, flutes, and clarinets in collaboration with ""loft scene"" free-jazz OG William Hooker, and Lee Ranaldo, founding member of Sonic Youth and former guitar-tuner for Glenn Branca. The hook, if it's there: A single moment, probably spontaneous, but fully formed. And if not, then something so wild it briefly lunges out of the clattering background. From the jazz end, Sonny Rollins' ""Blue Seven"" bop gets sauced up on loose Hooker drums, and flexes with Ranaldo guitar skronk, but hey, Rollins did it for 10 minutes at least, and these guys only make it for five-plus. Tradition is unquestionably the back door of this stuff, so besides flashing cred, the results are best when the players slide off to the side: Check out the marathon ""Conference Call"", which weaves answering machine messages, Pauline Oliveros-like vocalizing, and beat poetry into a schizophrenic, saxophone-led charge into the subconscious. The trio earns its keep here, wrestling drama from some truly mundane shit. (""I'm checking the schedule""... ""we just pulled into Seattle""... ""a man lies on the beach."") But the flipside applies, too. Free jazz, as it's played on ""The Mechanism"", is three guys going to war with each other-- ""my sax,"" ""my fucking drum fill,"" ""fuck it, I'm shouting""-- and it flattens every dimension. This was a live set: ""Mechanism"" was the warm up. No way to feel the ghost but to try, but the id doesn't arrive until ""Eyemote"", expressed as insect sounds and mouthpiece muttering: ""It's not my fault I'm Catholic. I was born this way."" Now there's an idea. Oasis of Whispers might be all fighting in the trenches if not for its monster title track. The sex jam on an otherwise boy's club afternoon, ""Oasis of Whispers"" withholds, prolongs, and growls. Hall purrs; a kazoo sounds; Ranaldo does sub-audible mood electronics and delay; Hooker hits and backs off; they simultaneously give space and get right up in the face of the thing. Restraint compels, and this track owns because they own every second. Longing for the hard core is what haunts the rest of the record. Getting worked up is hot for the players and hot for the played to, but rarely at the same time: When Hall/Ranaldo/Hooker hit the gas pedal, the backseat nods off; only when they get quiet do the kids wake up and notice.","Alien8 collaboration between these Downtown-approved artists: Canadian everything guy Glen Hall, ""loft scene"" free jazz'er William Hooker, and Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo.

Perfect Pitch Black,Cave In,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a560b1335d7bf1698bab/1:1/w_160/01227297.jpg,2006-01-31 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1364-perfect-pitch-black/,Hydra Head,"Cave In's 2003 major-label debut garnered comparisons to Radiohead, Foo Fighters, and, in at least one review, Blue Öyster Cult. The new direction caused throngs of longtime fans to turn their backs on the band, and the cash-in, resulting in a slick but sickly commercial hardcore sound, ultimately bombed. Two years later, the band is back on Hydra Head, and while there are a few nods to the Cave In of days past, Perfect Pitch Black is nonetheless a melodic rock album at heart. Strikingly, Perfect Pitch Black succeeds because of-- not in spite of-- its catchy melodies, infectious riffing, and silk-smooth vocals. The tempos, generally in the mid-to-slow range, give the songs time to develop, allowing them to sink in gradually. Additionally, bassist Caleb Scofield's guttural hardcore barking, once such a signature element of Cave In's sound, only shows up here on occasion, as an accent to Stephen Brodsky's clear, gliding vocal style that more closely resembles the hard-rock singers of the 70s. Fresh off manning the decks for the Red Chord and Victory at Sea, producer Andrew Schneider lends these songs a heady atmosphere, ripe with booming drums, glistening guitars, and twisted reverb effects. Following a brief intro, ""The World Is in Your Way"" rolls in on a slow, jerky rhythm, but begins to hint at something more sinister as the guitars shift into a slightly atonal style, and Scofield's bestial holler breaks through-- a blend of melody and slow-burning fury that sets the tone for much of the disc's runtime. ""Trepanning"", however, applies a different formula, spinning a guitar-groove boogie as Scofield snarls through the verses. The song leads into ""Paranormal"", a seven-minute atmospheric piece which weaves elements of psychedelia into the band's heavy riffage. Another surprising moment comes with ""Ataraxia"", a math-metal instrumental that blends layers of fuzzy, twisting guitars and distant, nebulous vocals. Each of Cave In's albums to date has marked a distinct shift and change of approach, and Perfect Pitch Black's strength lies with their ability to seamlessly intertwine their past and present, experimenting with a diverse array of progressive genres and styles while remaining true to their metalcore roots. Granted, this is a far cry from the band's earlier work, and five years on from Jupiter, their creative apex does seem to have come and gone. On the other hand, few bands are capable of weathering so much change while remaining so consistent. Given the obstacles and challenges of their decade-long career, Perfect Pitch Black is a far more rewarding album than Cave In should rightly be capable of producing this late in the game.","The once-abrasive Hydra Head band continues to work with catchy melodies, infectious riffing, and smooth vocals.

What Else Is There? EP,Röyksopp,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c99d034d5c69bf2c9c/1:1/w_160/61dcb90b.gif,2006-01-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6862-what-else-is-there-ep/,Astralwerks,"When Röyksopp announced plans to issue an EP consisting almost entirely of ""What Else Is There?"" remixes, fans couldn't have been blamed for assuming the disc would be better suited to a club enviroment than home listening. As it turns out, this ain't another Romance Bloody Romance-style money grab, or feckless quest for some intangible fountain-of-youth a la Guerolito. The disc's cadre of first-tier producers-- including Vitalic, Anders Trentemøller, and Jacques Lu Cont-- send the original track, already an album highlight, through their own signature portals, and the fun lies in each transformation's unique results. Anders Trentemøller's jagged slice of psychosis earns flagship status here. The Knife's Karin Dreijer pulls an impressive faux-Björk on vocals, and Trentemøller's mercilessly mechanical rhythm section leaves her forsaken in a dehumanized world. Even during the bridge, during which all accompaniment drops out-- save a viscous, meaty bassline-- Dreijer's voice rings metallic, eventually scraping up against a gnashing string section. Psychologically, the song rings true to Röyksopp's more organic, soft-edged original, greatly contrasting more bubblegum renderings by Jacques Lu Cont and the Emperor Machine. Lu Cont basically foists a disco edit on us, with the nerve to toss in a ""Waiting for Tonight"" bassline and J-Lo oh-oh's. Karin's ""flashlights and explosions"" line works surprisingly well as a bubbly, lithium-induced club credo, though an overall weak beat and disappointing build prematurely pull the plug on the party. The Emperor Machine packs more goodies in his bag, burying Karin's wrenching lyrics under photon zaps and floating space disco debris. A bit insensitive, perhaps, but she sounds cool with it, cooing over the song's swanky, palm-muted cool-down. Vitalic rounds out the mix nicely, countering Lu Cont's fluffy pillow-talk gem with a bilious high-register drone. While the track finds him flexing a little too muscle in wake of his own incredible debut album, it gives the EP a coked-up freakout edge and a rigid framework trapping Karin with the repeated phrase, ""I don't know what more to ask for/ I was given just one wish."" Together, the remixes make for one exciting version of the dating game, each hotshot DJ making their efforts to win Karin for themselves. Final count: one stud, one cocksure dude, and three pretty boys. Not too shabby, especially considering it's all for an above-average track on an average album.","Astralwerks EP features remixes from first-tier producers such as Vitalic, Anders Trentemøller, and Jacques Lu Cont.

"Too Old, Too Cold EP",Darkthrone,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcdc0084474cd0c2942/1:1/w_160/f6e86812.gif,2006-01-31 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2634-too-old-too-cold-ep/,Peaceville,"Darkthrone, one of black metal's longest running anti-ambassadors, have one hell of a history: Known for actively disregarding usual music biz tropes, they formed in Norway in 1986 as generic death metal quartet Black Death. Their debut as Darkthrone, Soulside Journey, was released in 1990, but it wasn't until they fell under the thrall of Mayhem, Bathory, and Celtic Frost-- and busted out the corpsepaint-- that they found their own path. Second album A Blaze in the Northern Sky (1991) is therefore considered to be the group's first true statement, and along with Under a Funeral Moon (1993) and Transilvanian Hunger (1994), one-third of the band's classic trio of records. (To get a sense of the early sound, neophytes should check out A Blaze's ""Kathaarian Life Code"", Transilvanian Hunger's title track, and ""The Dance of Eternal Shadows"" from Funeral Moon.) During this period, the band recorded songs with lyrics by Burzum's Varg Vikernes, who was famously found guilty of three counts of arson for burning churches and is currently incarcerated for the murder of Mayhem bandmate Euronymous. Now an Odalist, Vikernes was once an outspoken proponent of neo-Nazism and fascism. Although Darkthrone never openly shared his violent tendencies, they did include the following statement in a Transilvanian Hunger press release: ""We would like to state that Transilvanian Hunger stands beyond any criticism. If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior."" They later retracted it at the label's urging and today purport to take an apolitical stance, but the cloud remains. A duo since Transilvanian Hunger, drummer/vocalist/main lyricist Fenriz and guitarist/bassist/vocalist Nocturno Culto are still ruffling feathers, albeit in a less alarming fashion. ""Too Old Too Cold"", the single for Darkthrone's upcoming 12th album, The Cult Is Alive, is a ""death to false metal"" call to arms. Playing punk riffs in the realm of Turbonegro, Culto grumbles, ""Nothing to prove/ Just a hellish rock-n-roll freak/ You call your metal black/ It's just spastic, lame, and weak."" It's their catchiest song to date, though it completely lacks the evil ambiance of earlier classics. Okay, let the black metal webboards argue about whether or not Motörhead, Crass, and Exploited-like Darkthrone is still the real deal; the band's own site is ambiguous about the whole thing: ""We are still performing metal. Blackmetal you say? well, yeah, maybe, depends on who is listening."" Ah, Stanley Fish would be proud. It's interesting to ponder where the band's going with this newer, more accessible sound. There are a few issues that may concern diehards: Too Old, Too Cold is their first ever single, and they're also releasing their first ever video for it. The four songs included here, recorded in the band's home studio, are crisper than anything they've done. In the past, Darkthrone intentionally deconstructed their technical skills and recorded on lo-fi equipment, questing for a certain purity in their approach-- and this? These tracks are less technically interesting than past efforts, but they offer more oomph than 2004's middling Sardonic Wrath. We're also treated to the band's first cover, a Danzig-esque remake of Siouxsie and the Banshees' ""Love In a Void"". It's fun to hear Siouxsie's haunting ""too many bigots for my liking/ Too many critics... too few writing/ Rabid dogs that just ain't biting"" transformed into something both violent and dorkily Viking-esque, but the reworking pales in comparison to the original. The best track is ""High on Cold War"", largely because of the shredding guest vocals by Enslaved's Grutle Kjellson, who tackles the first two verses with Culto taking over after that. The EP closes with the Celtic Frost-ish ""Graveyard Slut"" with Culto on vocals. There are moments to savor, but all in all, the four tracks are largely unremarkable. Still, I'm inordinately excited about The Cult Is Alive for one reason: Darkthrone recorded its best material for Peaceville then left the label in 1994; ever the romantic, their return to the label strikes me as an almost symbolic move. (Either that, or smart marketing: Peaceville also reissued the 2001 best-of compilation, Preparing for War, as a box set complete with a bonus CD of extra demos and a DVD of live performances and interviews.) So, unless you're a diehard, then, it may be wise to steer clear of this single and sleep with one eye open until the release of The Cult Is Alive.","Teaser for the The Cult Is Alive finds the black metal group covering Siouxsie & the Banshees and creating the most crisp music of their career.

Tropicália: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7eb9d034d5c69bf38fb/1:1/w_160/4f981594.gif,2006-01-31 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1997-tropicalia-a-brazilian-revolution-in-sound/,Soul Jazz,"The flame of Tropicália didn't burn long, but it burned brightly, and in just a few short years during the late 60s, the movement sparked a revolution that drastically altered the landscape of Brazilian art and popular culture. While history tends to place the strongest significance on the musical achievements of the Tropicálistas, the movement bridged all mediums-- poetry, film, and theater all felt its influence. Tropicália was fraught with political tension as well, embodying the anger, anxieties, and desires of the Brazilian left, which was then struggling under the Brazilian military's oppressive rule, a junta that lasted from 1964 to 1985. Tom Zé, a major figure within the movement, put it bluntly: ""I don't make art; I make spoken and sung journalism."" Naturally, this overt radicalism greatly limited the movement's lifetime: In 1969, two of Tropicália's most admired personalities, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, were jailed for their dissension. Remarkably, this circumstance prevented neither from releasing albums that year; they simply recorded vocal tracks in their cells and sent the tapes to their associates for embellishment. Upon their release from government custody, however, both artists left the country for England, and by the early 1970s, Tropicália had more or less run its course, giving way to the less extreme but similarly striking sounds of Musica Popular Brasileiro. Soul Jazz's new Tropicália: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound compilation takes an extremely focused look at six of the most important and influential Tropicália artists, bringing together material from the movement's 1968-70 heyday for a superb 20-song anthology of one of the 20th century's most unique musical moments. Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé, and Jorge Ben are responsible for some of the most bracing records Brazil ever produced-- and though omissions are certain to be an issue for cratedigging obsessives, this collection is as flawless a primer as has ever been made available on a single disc. The compilers made an interesting decision when they opted to bookend the compilation with two different versions of ""Bat Macumba""-- one by Os Mutantes, the other a collaboration between that band and Gilberto Gil. The two versions do go a long way toward illustrating the extremes of the movement-- Gil's is a sleek, propulsive groove machine topped with a wicked sitar lead, while the Mutantes transform the song into a sloppy psychedelic pile-up of Bahian drumming and spasmodic fuzz guitar-- but this also means that Veloso's literally genre-defining ""Tropicália"", from his 1968 self-titled album, winds up at track 13, which doesn't really feel right. As the opener of Veloso's first self-titled album, ""Tropicália"" was a blast across the bow of complacency in Brazilian popular music, which by then had already been inching toward explosive change for a few years. The song opens with a flutter of scraped violin strings, ringing bells, congas, and spoken narration before congealing into a swelling, stop/start verse, which is balanced by a charging, sing-song chorus. Veloso's other tracks here were all conceived and recorded behind prison walls: ""Irene"" is deceptively placid, with acoustic guitar and shaker backed by genius arranger Rogério Duprat's deftly scored horns and flutes. Of course, the seemingly innocent line ""I want to hear Irene laughing"" is much darker: Irene was the nickname for criminal and leftist icon TexF3rio Cavalcanti's machine gun. Radical politics are replaced by radical production techniques on Os Mutantes' ingenious ""Panis et Circenses"", a wild tape collage littered with horn fanfares that finds the band repeatedly fading in and out, and even slows the end of one verse to an abstract smear. They play it straighter on the outstanding ""Quem Tem Medo de Brincar de Amor"", which has a chorus that could vie with any French pop of the period for sheer sophistication, Rita Lee's breathy croon blending effortlessly with the harmonies of the Baptista brothers. Meanwhile, Gal Costa's ""Tuareg"", drawn from her outrageously strange second self-titled album, mixes Brazilian rhythms with Saharan harmonies and instrumentation, using pentatonic oboe figures and oud licks to anchor the melody. On ""Sebastiana"", she switches gears from breathy to bizarre, breaking into a weird throat rattle near the end of the first verse. A number of moments here simply rock: The opening of Gil's ""Procissao"" features an incredible guitar solo over a chord sequence that foreshadows Paul Simon's ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" by two years, while Zé's ""Jimmy, Renda Se"" rides a killer descending guitar riff and strutting funk beat, sounding like a blueprint for Jorge Ben's 1970 classic ""Ponta de Lanca Africano"". Solid as Tropicália's tracklist is, though, it's hard not to miss anthems like ""Baby"", ""Parque Industrial"", ""Alegria, Alegria!!!"", and ""Pais Tropical"", calling into question whether this compilation would have been better served with the inclusion of an additional disc. But then, that may also have been too ambitious an undertaking for newcomers, and of course, each is available for tracking down in its own right for anyone interested in further exploring this music. And if you do want to seek out an additional introductory disc, you can always pick up the landmark 1968 compilation Tropicália: Ou Panis et Circenses, with which the Soul Jazz set only shares in common two tracks. There are artists whom one could argue deserve inclusion on this kind of Tropicália overview-- Chico Buarque, Maria Bethânia, Lo Borges, and MPB4 come to mind-- as does the solo work of Rita Lee and Rogério Duprat, and also Wilson Simonal, whose ""pilantragem"" (roughly, ""piracy"") style and four-volume Alegria, Alegria!!! series laid some important musical groundwork for the movement. Still, Soul Jazz's decision to hone its focus actually results in an overall sharper, more unified collection than such cobbling together could provide. As such, Tropicália: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound seems the obvious starting point for anyone who's ever been curious about the movement, but found the array of difficult-to-find and often expensive albums too bewildering to approach.","Soul Jazz comp presents a superb introduction to one of the 20th century's most singular musical moments by focusing only on the movement's leading lights: Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé, and Jorge Ben.

Levitation,Mark O’LearyTomasz StańkoBilly Hart,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c465eb335119a49ed933/1:1/w_160/185cce67.jpg,2006-01-30 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6121-levitation/,Leo,"As off-the-mainstream jazz sinks deeper into a niche, it's more difficult to track down all of the great improvisers in America-- let alone the rest of the world, where a glance at the hatArt or Leo Records catalogs turns up dozens of new and unfamiliar names. So I was pleased to discover the work of Mark O'Leary, a guitarist based in Cork, Ireland-- and was even more surprised to learn he'd worked with so many big names of improv here and abroad, from touring in Paul Bley's group, to collaborating with downtown New Yorkers like Joey Baron and Matthew Shipp. O'Leary plays with a clean, unpretentious tone, spinning inventive solos that he can ratchet up to breathless speeds with no sign of showiness. He echoes the rigorously unadorned style of Joe Morris, and his technique of switching (sometimes mid-piece) between a distorted tone and a gentle, sustained one resembles Bill Frisell's style without cloning it. But as a rule, O'Leary shies away from easy imitations: You can guess who he's listened to, but his style is his own. Just last year, O'Leary released four strong albums on Leo. Each one puts him in a trio with a risky, adventurous sideman, a drummer or a pianist for the rhythm section, and no bassist-- a gap that leaves each band challengingly unanchored. I recommend the pensive Chamber Trio album with Matthew Shipp and Mat Maneri, or his latest record with Uri Caine and Ben Perowsky, Closure, a rambunctious date where O'Leary pushes his knuckles as fast as they can bend in a John McLaughlin-like wrestling match with his fretboard. But the best place to start would be Levitation, a session from five years ago with distinguished Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko and veteran jazz and fusion drummer Billy Hart. Throughout this one-day session you can hear the chemistry develop between Stanko and O'Leary: Both men are serious and measured, but also curious. The mostly languorous tempos make them pace like animals checking out their turf, while Hart-- ducking away from a time-keeping role-- keeps the ground shifting and shaking beneath them. This is the kind of slow but taut improvisation that few people do well, and it's almost always engrossing. And when they heat up, they can knock the wind out of you-- especially on the 16-minute title cut, where O'Leary gradually turns up the distortion as he and Stanko trade one feverish solo after another. This is patient music, but it sure knows how to pounce.","Best of four albums released last year from Irish jazz guitarist O'Leary documents a five-year-old session with trumpeter Tomasz Stanko and veteran drummer Billy Hart.

The Garden of Brokenness,William Basinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2285e6ef95969320358/1:1/w_160/47e72a5f.gif,2006-01-30 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/580-the-garden-of-brokenness/,2062,"The sustain pedal was one of the greatest discoveries of my life. I still remember the first few times I ever sat at a piano, holding it down and letting the notes vibrate against each other until they faded to imperceptibility. And then doing it again. Incredibly, the sound of felt hammers on metal strings can be used to express almost any emotion you could name. In 1979, when he first recorded the piano loops used on The Garden of Brokenness, William Basinski says he was attempting capture ""mono no aware,"" a Japanese concept whose closest English translation is ""the sadness of things."" ""Things"" could be taken two ways, of course-- it may refer to the general state of being alive, or to literal, physical objects. Either way, these sad, slow piano loops are the kind of sounds that poke around in your guts looking for sensitive spots to nestle into. The sound of The Garden of Brokenness should be familiar to anyone who's dipped into Basinski's well of recently reconstituted old tapes before-- it shares more than a passing affinity with Variations: A Movement in Chrome Primitive, A Red Score in Tile, or December 2004's Silent Night, being drawn from the same well. The record consists of one 50-minute pianoscape, really no more than a couple of chords wandering in their own reverb. As the loop persists, Basinski mixes it with soft drones and the sounds of amplitude modulation. The piece is punctuated by two lengthy passages of near-silence, where the sound that builds up over the preceding minutes is allowed to die away to nothing, clearing the air completely for the next build-up. As beautiful as it is, there is a certain sense on The Garden of Brokenness that Basinski has been here before, and that his supply of old tapes may be running out. He's proven his ability to work outside of his aging archives with his Watermusic series, and I suspect that his rewarding series of records built around these decaying sound sources may soon come to an end. Should that be the case, no worries: Basinski has injected more than his share of beauty into the world through these recordings.","More sad, slow yet beautiful piano loops built from recently reconstituted old tapes.

Keys to the World,Richard Ashcroft,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11a9d034d5c69bf28a6/1:1/w_160/9079ec97.jpg,2006-01-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/313-keys-to-the-world/,Parlophone,"Anyone with ample knowledge of Jim Morrison and proper distance from adolescent fandom recognizes the Lizard King's gift for comedy. Forget poetry, dude brought the laffs, from quasi-poetically stringing together the words ""mute nostril agony"" to regaling us with tales of ""Indians scattered on dawn's highway."" Priceless! Our ex-hippie gym teachers were right: The Doors frontman died way too young. Because, had the Shaman of Shtick made it through the 1970s, he might have realized his now-obvious comedic ambitions as fully as Richard Ashcroft, who used to catch Mojo Risin' comparisons back when his former band, the Verve, were actually psychedelic. Now, I slapped an 8.3 rating on a compilation of the Verve's singles as recently as 2004, and didn't hate Ashcroft's last two solo albums as much you all did, so my expectations were wide-open approaching Keys to the World, which the man self-hyped with Gallagher-brother aplomb as ""hot shit."" Riffing on John Lennon, he clearly meant ""flaming pile."" See, Ashcroft's latest takes the over-seriousness of 2002's Human Conditions-- which he has personally likened to Marvin Gaye's best work-- and turns it still seriouser, into inimitable omg-wtf farce. Swept up in maudlin strings and chintzy brass, Ashcroft blurs his anguished syllables like Tom Petty doing Bob Dylan, embraces U2-jerkoff bombast, and follows his idiosyncratically generic muse into uncharted depths. Keys to the World is as hilariously indulgent as ""Trapped in the Closet"", if vastly less self-aware; it's also a more laughable satire of contemporary music than Bang Bang Rock 'n' Roll, though less durable and totally accidental. Before Keys to the World, I never knew Coldplay's ""Fix You"" was subtle. Then I heard ""The Words Just Get in the Way"" (inevitably inferior to the similarly titled Gloria Estefan power ballad), on which, over colorless midtempo acoustic guitars, Ashcroft offers Chris Martin-like assistance: ""When your back's against the wall/ There's no one left to call/ Then call me."" And right on cue come the handclaps, the twangy guitar licks, dripping strings, and endless ""Hey Jude"" ad libs. ""Sing it to me now!"" Ashcroft instructs to a chanting chorus that, appropriately, consists only of himself. Before Keys to the World, I never knew Bono was humble. The title track loops a C+C Music Factory-esque vocal sample amid canned MOR rhythms and melodramatic synths as Ashcroft jumps into a tragic, awkwardly worded tale: ""Institutions, you went through them, ah/ From the age of five/ And no one loves you, cared/ If you lived or you died."" But, like Africa's great white Time Person-of-the-Year hope with money-solves-everything ambitions, Ashcroft has another hubristic fix: ""Perhaps I could make it better."" How, Richard? ""I've got the keys to the world, yeah, aw/ Mixed-up world/ I've got the keys to the world, yeah."" For good measure, we also get an Everlast-style megaphone almost-rap. I promise. Before Keys to the World, I never knew our world's problems could be presented so laughably by anyone not named Stephen Colbert. On fast-paced opener ""Why Not Nothing"", Ashcroft takes shots at the religious right (""the god squad""). But his slurred barbs soon fizzle into non-sequiturs: ""Who the fuck are you when you take that mask away?/ Friend, I don't know/ Oh, where do we go?"" Again Ashcroft has a keen suggestion for our betterment: ""Take my advice, don't let 'em treat you like a fool."" Then he emits porcine grunts for the last 30 seconds. On brightly adorned showstopper ""World Keeps Turning"", he mentions the U.S. president in suddenly apolitical fashion, and informs us of the Earth's movements with all the self-destructive solemnity of Copernicus: ""The world keeps turning/ Everybody's learning/ Keep your head up."" Before Keys to the World, I agreed with the general consensus that music reviews should be relatively concise. But I still haven't told you about how ""Cry to the Morning"" reinterprets those three ominous ""All Along the Watchtower"" chords on music-box keyboard, how mechanically depressive single ""Break the Night With Colours"" bizarrely hints at Mr. Big's ""To Be With You"", or how the sprightly Cat Stevens folksiness that opens ""Why Do Lovers?"" transmogrifies into a fierce affirmation of a deity's existence, the stupefying one-liner, ""The demons I've got they are amazing,"" and the stupefyinger, ""Life is tough and life can be hard."" On Jim Morrison's sprawling, nipple-eyed ""Celebration of the Lizard"", chronicled on the 1970 double-disc Absolutely Live album, he captured psychotropic absurdity Ashcroft hasn't matched in years. He does this on the neighbor-loving (""until his wife gets home"") title track from 1969's The Soft Parade, too. And also on the posthumous An American Prayer poetry disc, with impossibly kitschy blues-funk overdubbed by his surviving bandmates, money-grubbers even then. The drugs really worked for Morrison. Ashcroft, too, could leave audiences howling with that record's finest rib-tickler: ""I will always be a word man, better than a bird man.""","Another collection of maudlin strings, chintzy brass, and anguished, bombastic vocals from the once-charismatic Verve singer.

Breakupdown / Bounce Le Remix,Ghislain Poirier,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1acc0084474cd0bfe75/1:1/w_160/337def4c.jpg,2006-01-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11809-breakupdown-bounce-le-remix/,Chocolate Ind.,"Here's where I finally tell you about my 8th grade geography teacher, Brother Frederick*, who always told me to think of the Americas as the silhouette of a voluptuous woman, her tailbone sitting on Rio, the heft of her bosom curving toward the Pacific (fly-ass weave shaking out the Eastern seaboard). Did wonders when I got older and wasn't appalled by the Peru protruding below the waistline, but it didn't really give proper attention to the nape of her neck arching through Ghis' Montreal. With every DJ up and down that spine dedicated to the lady's Rio, the neck has been neck-lected (yep), but Poirier is certain to take care of all that. While bloggers stack paper blending J-Kwon's and Franz at bars, Ghis grinds up north on heartless bass to snap your neck and jack your body. Breakupdown, Ghis' proper album has no sweet nothings or sing-alongs: Frivolities have been ground to dust by Poirier's heavy fingers on what sounds to be three or four pads, at most, on his console. His apparent disdain for superfluous synth flourishes or multi-tracked instrumentation makes it seem as if he'd only ever heard music through a wall of man-sized monitors. In his hands, Baltimore club becomes only its redlined drums. Hip-hop is a muffled snare and rumbling bass. Crunk is a tempo. Dancehall and ragga, an overwhelming riddim. If a synth or sample appears-- whether it be buzzing strings or a hollow flute-- it is percussive, adding more depth to the cavernous beats. It's great for anyone who's listened to those genres and wondered why nerds (like me) fret over samples or parse lyrics. That's not to say Poirier is joyless, only that he's a minimalist. Instead of interpreting different styles, he distills them to their common elements, bass and drums, and avoids glitching them into intelligent dance music. As smart as his music is, Poirier seems most concerned with neckboning his listeners, giving the coke-rap opponents something to rock in the whip. When he does allow room for a guest vocal, it's a Francophone (Omnikron, Seba), a Chicagoan toaster (DJ Collage of many a Klein record), London non-grime (Lotek Hi-Fi), or Beans, none of whom steal the show from young Ghis. For those of us who rank major-label rap in our year-ends, Ghislain has remixed a handful of recent favorites on his self-released Bounce le Remix (available for purchased download at http://www.ghislainpoirier.com). Here he applies his theory to them Ying-Yang characters, Missy, M.I.A., Snoop, Dizzee, and Busta, among others, but it's really more about breaking down recent groundbreakers. Whether it's the Neptunes' ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" or Timbaland's ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"", Poirier strips the body breaks to bare kick and snare. Even Mr. Collipark's ""Wait (The Whisper Song)"", an exercise in austerity, sounds naked in comparison. And I'll be damned if Ghis' version of Roots Manuva's ""Witness (1 Hope)"" isn't the best Roots Manuva song I've heard since the ""Walworth Road Rockers Dub"" remix of the same track. But the coup de grace on an album of graces has to be the unofficial Ghislain Poirier remix of ""Ice Ice Baby"". Now, I know time has turned this song and its creator into a joke, but this version, minus the infamous Queen sample, will hopefully convince many of the lyrical genius of Vanilla Ice. He was no gimmick! Stop snitchin'! *Bro-Fred ended up quitting the cloth to sell vibrators, probably to smart girls who dance to Ying-Yang but hate oppression.",,7.9,
One,Matthew Shipp,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b2b1335d7bf169830d/1:1/w_160/17a67ea9.jpg,2006-01-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7121-one/,Thirsty Ear,"Ever the prudent iconoclast, pianist Matthew Shipp has used his past contributions to Thirsty Ear's ongoing Blue Series to cross-pollinate jazz with active electronic and DJ-cultures, adding innovators like Antipop Consortium and Chris Flam to his impressive register of collaborators. For his latest addition to the series, however, Shipp has cleared the gallery to unveil his first solo piano album since 2002's Songs-- an album of jazz standards-- and his first collection of original solo material in nearly a decade. As such, One simultaneously serves as both a meditative re-centering and as a further departure, with Shipp quietly redirecting his familiar post-Cecil Taylor vocabulary towards a singular form of numinous chamber music. With their compact, elegant architecture and measured elocution, One's 12 songs often resemble the early 20th century piano studies of Ravel or Debussy as closely as they do modern jazz. On recent albums like Equilibrium or Harmony and Abyss, Shipp masked similar neo-classical touches beneath surface samples and programmed beats. But in this uncluttered format, Shipp has patiently afforded himself the space necessary to cultivate his sketches in full. On these tracks he plays with an expectant relish, an audible curiosity about where his compositions might next lead him. And while One will surely disappoint those who've come in hopes of fiery, atom-splitting improvisation, Shipp delivers these refined performances with such authority and sheer inquisitive force that his undisguised enthusiasm for this material can prove easily persuasive. ""Arc"" opens the album with a full-bodied, ascendent sequence of chords that confidently pave the way for the splashy ""Patmos"", which cascades into a dazzling series of single-note runs that pop away like flashbulbs. ""Gamma Ray"" finds Shipp at his most devoutly Monk-like, chipping away at the song's turbulent rhythms until settling into a loopy, satisfying Jelly Roll Morton rumble. Conversely, on the brief ""A Rose Is a Rose"" or the sumptiously melodic ""Zero"", he plays with such a willowy, art-nouveau grace that he seems at points to abandon forward momentum altogether, content to luxuriate in his own sun-splashed idyll. Unfortunately, Shipp's protracted sense of contentment can also work against him, as over the course of the album there are several instances when he lingers too long in his swirling, watercolored eddies. One is at its most effective when Shipp is at his most demanding, as on the dense tremors of ""Electro Magnetism"", where his furious, low-end tones threaten to shake the song loose from its floorboards. On such pieces Shipp creates an enthralling, unstable dynamic that he'll ideally build upon in his future work.","Latest Thirsty Ear release often resembles the early 20th century piano studies of Ravel or Debussy as closely as it does modern jazz.

But for a band that trades in that kind of ambiguity with no easy emotional answers, their balancing act is on a much higher wire-- the more melodrama they mine from their unique brand of restraint, the further they get from any kind of release. Albatross starts strong: ""Red Drop"" has a confident guitar strum and unpredictable breakdowns, and ""Closed Drum"" is a spirited Pinback nick with swinging acoustic arpeggios and simmering electric guitars creating white noise just below its surface. Unfortunately, the lengthy center of this record is a brick of brooding, mid-tempo dullness. The formula may not have changed much between records, but Albatross at its best suffers from an atmosphere so stale it chokes the songs, and at worse sounds like the soundtrack to Rain Man, given the booming percussion and hanging organ tones on songs like ""Play the Part"" and ""Not Asleep"". The Standard never get cartoonishly morose, but their plundering of the same gray middle ground becomes exhausting from a lack dynamics or pacing. The moments of brightness are fleeting, like the notes of Jay Clarke's piano in ""Not Asleep"" that flutter above the ponderousness of the track like a feather on a gust of wind. Other breaths of fresh air come late in the record: The factory-line pounding of the penultimate track ""In Waves"" provides a much-needed shot in the arm, and the bubbling organ in the intro ""Little Green"" neatly incorporates post-rock sounds and textures, but it stumbles into a wall of guitars that's more like a knee-high ledge and a coda that strains to reach poignancy. ""You Will"" is less dynamic, but Putnam's calm monotone shows an ease and confidence that brings a sigh of relief, though no less weary than the rest of the album. You'd think that for keeping the mood so static and the focus so narrow, more of the songs on Albatross would hit their mark.","Melodramatic Yep Roc band builds a quiet tension between guitars, pianos, and Tim Putnam's terse yelp.

The Very Heart of the World,Burning Star Core,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4af9d034d5c69bf311a/1:1/w_160/2168c93c.gif,2006-01-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1195-the-very-heart-of-the-world/,Thin Wrist,"On my turntable, pre-Burning Star Core, was Songs of the Humpback Whale, part of Capitol's brief foray into selling the sounds of the natural world. On a different label (say Eclipse, or Important), the whale might have made it big: Underwater anyway, humpbacks run a huge sound game. Like some above sea level, humpbacks perform by circling for hours around groups of repetitive phrases sung together, incorporating individual whale improvs as they arise; from gradual changes, they evolve new songs. On land, or without a sonograph, background noise is more prosaic: Screaming florescent lights, gurgling computers, ambient traffic noise, wind, floorboard creaks. What's heard, vs. what's meant to be heard, well, who knows, but for sound as Sound, Burning Star Core's gurgle is positively baleen. C. Spencer Yeh's Burning Star Core has been around in one form or another since 1993, though The Very Heart of the World is only their second widely available release, after 2002's Brighter Summer Day. This album finds Yeh joined by Midwestern noise notables Robert Beatty, Mike Connelly, and Trevor Tremaine of Hair Police (Connelly now performs with Wolf Eyes as well); the full cast of KY's Eyes and Arms of Smoke; and others, among them players from Noumena and Apples in Stereo, taking turns on percussion, ""presence,"" electronics, guitar, and strings. Yeh's Drone Disco imprint is also alive and well, as is his impossibly prolific solo and collab career: A duo with Magik Markers' Pete Nolan late last year, a trio with John Olson and Jessica Rylan, BxC splits with Comets on Fire, plus infinite stacks of CD-Rs and tapes. Yeh's dictum, like Mark E. Smith's: If he's in the building, it's a Burning Star Core gig, cassette release, limited-edition silkscreened print, and, probably, forgotten the next day. Though Yeh runs with the circuit breakers and benders, he rolls chronic and sheet music with the same ease: Tony Conrad's the obvious touchstone, and Yeh can play, but he also doesn't mind mucking up the works with the wet noise, gibberish talk, and free percussion that gives The Very Heart of the World its elevation-of-everyday-life punch. ""Benjamin"" layers late night, outside-the-bedroom-window ambient music-- a car-crash violin drone toys with a cricket chirp, while branches tap glass. ""Catapults"" marches over windy keys and wake-up snares for zone-outs leisurely and eerie. Tremaine's hits move Yeh's violin drone past minimalism to a less formal, cluttered quiet. While most BxC subliminals work up low-key disruptions into aural legibility, Yeh & co. are more than capable of lowering the brow. ""Come Back Through Me"" rediscovers an inclination toward hitting big, tapping sticks, loosing guitar chords, and violining lines in and out of phase. This is their most whale song of whale songs: One short phrase worked over through time, built big and long-range with key improvs, string scrapes, and a low-grade electronic wash. The frenzy's nice, but it begs another record flip. Back to the beginning.","C.

Sunbomber EP,Excepter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfcea9e61561daa75e6/1:1/w_160/effefbd2.jpg,2006-01-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2915-sunbomber-ep/,5RC,"Since their inception, Excepter have been the slipperiest of NYC's free/noise/improv acts, their murky evolutions making even the irregular careers arcs of such contemporaries as Black Dice or Liars seem comparatively linear. Throughout their work Excepter have shown a decided preference for the glancing blow, addressing their musical subjects from the most indirect angles possible, and rarely striking from the same direction twice. On the band's latest, the five-song EP Sunbomber, they demonstrate their most overt minimalist pop gestures yet. But in typical Excepter fashion, these tracks often seem less full-fledged songs than simply the bones and shadow of song, remnants left behind by their authors' cryptic scavenging. Sunbomber is the first record by Excepter in their current incarnation as a quartet, with versatile noisemaker Jon Nicholson added to the fold. Gone are husband and wife duo Calder Martin and Caitlin Cook, and with them many of the more dilated, impenetrable fusions of 2004's KA or last year's Throne. This EP was reportedly recorded in one hour during the quartet's first performance together, and these slack, disorderly tracks make it easy to take such claims at face value. Although similar in construction to portions of their recent Self Destruction, here at least Excepter haven't the cheek to identify Sunbomber as house music. Scaffolded with fragile programmed beats and numberless blips and plinks, on Sunbomber the group use their spectral electronics to ferret out stubborn avant-pop melodies that aren't fully accustomed to this manner of rough treatment. On opener ""One More Try"", ripples of synth and winds supply the birdcalls for Excepter's lo-fi, sun-stroked approximation of Martin Denny's exotica, before John Fell Ryan's unintelligible vocals stumble in like a derelict beachcomber and upset the tiki torches. Further garbled instructions are delivered on ""Bridge Traffic"", a track that combines twerpy atomized funk and jittery Eyewitness News keyboards to surprisingly attractive effect. The following ""Dawn Patrol"" maintains the set's steadiest rhythm-- laced through with a potent, whistling melody-- before opening into an impressive thicket of static and low-resolution drumbeats. Despite its melodic flourishes, however, in many respects Sunbomber stands as Excepter's noisiest outing to date. The supple, reverberant figures of past triumphs like ""Vacation"" have here been replaced by textures considerably more ragged and jarring, particularly on the set closing mini-epic ""The Sun Bomber"". On this track and elsewhere, the listener might wish that more attention had been paid to the drum programming, as their limpid beats too often feel flabby and perfunctory. (Who knows, maybe they could spend two hours recording next time.) Yet as ""The Sun Bomber"" is quietly chewed to gristle between Excepter's slow-grinding jaws, one can't help but marvel at the group's inability to create commonplace music, and be drawn again into their well-camouflaged snares.","Five-song EP displays the NYC free/noise/improv band's most overt minimalist pop gestures yet.

Last year, an early, incompleted version of his new album fell into the nefarious clutches of internet file-traders, effectively KILLING MUSIC. Undaunted, the nonjudgmental 28-year-old father of two soldiered ahead to finish work on these stark, essentially acoustic songs, adding a couple of new ones and jettisoning others, while erstwhile Pedro the Lion multi-instrumentalist Casey Foubert provided understated production. Now seeing official release on Barsuk, the completed Makers strains against time's passage, as rural Texas native Votolato alternately whispers and rasps stories about boxcars, train tracks, mining towns, dirt roads, and ""Frisco,"" accompanied by little more than a dusty harmonica. Unfortunately, bare-bones arrangements, train songs, and good intentions are no shortcut to supposed authenticity, and still less are they a guarantor of overall quality. The rootsy route isn't new to Votolato, whose former band Waxwing traversed wider pastures than their emo peers (even if I used to confuse them with Knapsack). 2003's Chris Walla-produced Suicide Medicine had more rocking moments, but Votolato's first solo songs, like 2001's ""Crabtree and Evelyn"", already foretold his current unplugged direction-- even if they were more Dashboard Confessional than railroad hymn. Still, innumerable nostalgists have hammered this spike in recent years, from the likes of Iron & Wine, Josh Ritter, and Kings of Convenience to Hayden, Damien Jurado, and Damien Rice-- not to mention the entire alt-country movement. Given the competition, mere earnestness isn't enough. With his fingerpicking low and percussion scarce, Votolato cedes the spotlight to his songwriting. However, a penchant for copywriter wordplay stacks Makers with a freight train full of awkwardness. ""The bones inside your mind were all broken"" sits clumsily atop the title track's steel guitar, while Votolato's narrator is ""a punchline who's punchdrunk"" on catchier, harmonica-soaked ""Portland Is Leaving"", in ""the kind of comedy where no one's laughing, because it's hard to."" Um, in this case it doesn't take a lot to laugh. A deft metaphor comparing clouds to ""stilts or crutches, I don't know which one"" on ""The Night's Disguise"" and death cleverly claiming ""anything that life didn't already take"" on ""Wait Out the Days"" can't reestablish Votolato's troubadour credentials after a few too many such doozies. Another trouble is that Votolato's songs sometimes sound less like their presumed rustic inspirations than the middle-of-the-road 1990s bands they influenced. To be sure, ""She Was Only in It for the Rain"" (moronically credited to ""Piss Pissedoffherson"" but notable for its ghostly Southern gothic verses), non-leaked addition ""White Daisy Passing"", and especially placid pastoral ""The Uppers Aren't Necessary Anymore"" reek of Sam Beamish hush and Garfunkadelic harmonies. Cool, the intricate guitar coda of ""Streetlights"" alights near ""Blackbird"". But frankly, Votolato's clear, all-American vocals amid the acoustic-pop backdrop of ""Goldfield"" brings to mind fellow Texans and one-time college-circuit idols Jackopierce; the way he intermittently goes hoarse for emphasis reminds me of another Southwestern band with that tendency, and by the time the maudlin ""I'm really leaving"" conclusion kicks in I'm wishing the track sounded more like the Gin Blossoms (don't hate). Oh yeah, SPOILER ALERT, the closing song reveals that the title of Makers refers to the whiskey. A deeper, more philosophical meaning is doubtless implied secondarily, but then again Votolato does ask us to pass him a ""bottle"" of the stuff. Either way it would require some stiff swigs indeed to deny that musical Ludditism is sometimes just atavism, and that a super-slo-mo HDTV close-up, far from being an end in itself, only ends up benefiting those with the fewest warts. ""Sounds too simple, but love is the only answer,"" Votolato insists. Fair enough, but I bought that record already-- what part of another simple maxim, ""make it new,"" don't you understand?","Seattle singer-songwriter retools and finally issues this Barsuk release a year after his rough draft started making the file-sharing rounds.

From a Compound Eye,Robert Pollard,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d4c0084474cd0bfc78/1:1/w_160/c67251a6.jpg,2006-01-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6386-from-a-compound-eye/,Merge,"GBV librarians can be meticulously taxonomical about Robert Pollard's work so far, splitting his legendary band's run into distinct eras of basement hobby, indie stardom, and mainstream whiffs, but never was there so distinct a demarcation point as 2004's New Year's Eve burial of the Guided by Voices banner. Surely Pollard's decision to retire the name was more than mere paperwork; after all, for at least the past decade, Pollard and GBV were practically synonymous. What message, then, was Bob trying to send with this continuity reset: a signal of impending stylistic change, a shift away from hand-me-down rock theatrics towards intimate introspection? Or perhaps just fatigue with having his new work constantly measured against the GBV yardstick? Whatever the reason, the retired Pollard is barely distinguishable from the pathologically prolific mic-swinging frontman we know and love-- at least in terms of work ethic. Having spent 2005 in what must have been an extremely painful ""hiatus"" (in Pollard terms, defined as only two EPs and a couple of side projects), the first month of 2006 brings the official release of his long-since-finished double-disc opus From a Compound Eye, declaring the club officially re-opened. While the album is hardly Pollard's first Christian-name release-- Fading Captain subscribers know of at least nine others-- most of his previous solo projects seemed to be little more than songbook dumps for completists. Packed with 26 stylistically and lyrically sprawling songs, it's difficult to excavate any simple proclamations from FaCE's considerable girth. The record's fidelity falls into the mid-fi range of early and late GBV: clean and balanced one minute, needle-in-the-red the next. Some tracks retain the hit-and-run unfinished snippet form of the band's peak; others stretch out past the rarely-reached five-minute barrier. Thematically, From a Compound Eye is an even more frustrating tangle, spirituality rubbing shoulders with boozy hedonism, ruminations on middle-age interrupted by youthful boasting, and self-examination pitted against extra-terrestrial fantasies. Perhaps it's always been this way; like many of his mid-90s indie hall-of-fame peers, Pollard has often obfuscated his inner thoughts with non-sequiturs and abstract language. Casting off his bandname and fast approaching his 50th birthday hasn't changed Pollard's approach on this point, though the tone of FaCE exudes a general sense of melancholy he's previously kept mostly hidden, such as when he diluted the divorce laments of Isolation Drills in arena-rock trappings. Even the moments of perfect pop one comes to expect from a Pollard album contain unavoidable tinges of sadness: Armchair-psychoanalyze the age difference inherent in ""Dancing Girls and Dancing Men"", or the creepy old man sex-boast ""I'm a Widow"". (Chorus: ""I'm a widow and I'm hot to do you."") All this soul-searching-- buried, accidental, or otherwise-- is a welcome respite from the increasingly cartoonish persona Pollard had come to inhabit; I welcomed the end of GBV's run not only for the sake of Bob's liver, but for the sake of his psyche, forced to deal with living up to his super-lush image at every performance. So while any musical evolution is nil, save maybe a marginally increased keyboard presence, FaCE still remains the most fascinating Bob-project in years, his approach thankfully free of desires for the radio acceptance and/or underground re-acceptance that have marred recent work. Cumbersome as it may be, From a Compound Eye launches a new journey for indie-rock's pre-eminent song-dispenser, an early indication that Pollard has directed his prolific flow inward.","Former Guided by Voices leader starts the next phase of his voluminous career with this, his debut solo album for Merge.

House Arrest,Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18413d197565213865a/1:1/w_160/0eed6308.jpg,2006-01-26 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6555-house-arrest/,Paw Tracks,"Let's pretend that Ariel Pink isn't Animal Collective's pet artist. That he's not unabashedly L.A. and doesn't get off on tickling our FM culture pleasure areas. That he doesn't deliberately sculpt his Brian Wilson/California weirdo-songwriter mythology to a T. That he doesn't pretend he invented genre-bending lo-fi. Got all that? Good, here's the kicker-- House Arrest is just another slightly above average album from Pink; controversy and fanfare be damned. It's a shame there's so much baggage with Pink's albums, but he hasn't exactly shied away from self-aware self-promotion. Opener ""Hardcore Pops Are Fun"" contains the line ""Pop music is good/ It sounds like it should/ Pop music is mine/ It tastes so divine."" Next song has Pink ""getting interesting results"" whenever he ""thinks of a band"" and ""sits down and tries,"" further pondering in the second verse whether he'll write a good song today. The track ends with a half-assed attempt at self-deprecation (""I'm not going to try anymore""), but further reinforces the fundamental beef surrounding Pink-- the dude tries too hard to be pop's puppet master, possessing the last 50 years of tuneful feel-goodness at his fingertips. I never thought I'd be saying this in an age of Coldplay and reality TV melodrama, but Pink's slapdash compositions could actually use some sentimentality, or at least gravitas, amidst the rapid-fire nostalgia. Some say Pink's expansiveness-for-emotiveness tradeoff works, but it feels like hors d'oeuvres in place of a scrumptious dessert. No doubt about it, Pink demonstrates a knack for hooks, however, and House Arrest comes as close to bare bones pop rock as Pink gets. So many of these tracks start strong, flashing GBV or Olivia Tremor Control-sized melodies only to botch them with three-plus minutes of ""experimental"" noise fodder. For 90 seconds ""The People I'm Not"" is the catchiest, tightest fake Elvis Costello track I'v heard, but it quickly disintegrates into a boring bridge and three-minute outro sounding nothing like the song's beginning. Despite its hokey meta, ""Interesting Results"" taps one of Robert Pollard's sing-along choruses and bite-sized AOR-via-8-track swagger. Pink's bankrupt Beck act ultimately bleeds through the majority of House Arrest ; his poor use of samples and rhythm sections make for one very unfunky white boy. Two kooky breakdowns bookend ""Almost Waiting"", but the soulless Bee Gees imitation in the middle unjustly separates them. The title track cracks up over its own joke, playing an answering machine message chastising Pink for failing to pay parking tickets before launching into a highly ADHD-affected mishmash. Unable to congeal for 10 coherent seconds, the track sheds new light on the Ariel Pink debate: It's not that he's too pretentious with his work, he's obviously too insecure to show his songwriting at face value.","Latest record from Paw Tracks' lo-fi, nostalgia-obsessed singer-songwriter.

Spectacular of Passages,Samara Lubelski,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf45e6ef9596932318d/1:1/w_160/9ebe73d4.jpg,2006-01-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4999-spectacular-of-passages/,Social Registry,"Can music get any gentler than this? Spectacular of Passages isn't ""soft"" in the sense of ""soft rock"" or ""the quiet is the new loud""; carving her own niche of idyllic bedroom psychedelia, Samara Lubelski's newest takes pop orchestrations to levels of insulation previously unimagined-- it's as though she recorded her murmured symphony inside a down pillow and comforter. Unlike de rigueur solo folkies, Lubelski isn't afraid to surround herself with an airy ""teenage symphony to god"" army. According to the liner notes, there are 15 participants here, not including the multi-instrumental, knob-turning Lubelski. Donning headphones, it's fascinating to try charting the ingenious ways she tucks and repositions the players into such a precise sound. The album was recorded between Germany and Brooklyn with a cast that includes some of her ex-Tower Recordings chums: P.G. Six on baroque flute and 12-string and Tim Barnes on drums/percussion. Among the other guests are Matt Heyner of No Neck Blues Band on upright bass and Espers' cellist Helena Espvall. Of course, Lubelski comes armed with everything from guitar and violin to poppi shakers, mellotron, and her lovely voice. For those who don't recognize Samara's name-- well, shame on you. Actually, no, she's such an understated, ethereal figure (think 4AD taken down a notch) that her relative anonymity makes sense. Still, she's been doing great things for a long time, whether fronting the trio Hall of Fame, playing internationally with Metabolismus, or working as an engineer at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room where she recorded the Fiery Furnaces and Magik Markers, among others. Her history with Tower Recordings was mentioned above, and she's also collaborated with everyone from Tara Jane O'Neil and White Magic to Jackie-O Motherfucker and Tony Conrad. Lubelski's 2004 solo album, The Fleeting Skies, was a favorite of mine when it was released. It's unfortunate to report that besides Spectacular of Passage's opener, ""Lick 'n Leap"", its neighbor ""Sister Silver"", and ""Broken Links"", this collection doesn't provide the same Technicolor chills and crushed velvet hooks as its predecessor. Judging from its luster, The Fleeting Skies aligned itself more with sunrises, whereas Spectacular evokes a powdered duskiness. There's plenty of beauty, but last time around the hooks were sharper, more defined. There's less temptation to sing along now; but then, perhaps these are mumbled good nights. (Images are often kinda blurred when you turn out the lights.) The gorgeous ""Orion""'s syrupy whispers could very well be an eventide offering to the constellation that gave it a name-- but eventually Mr. Sandman hits you upside the head with his goods. Don't misunderstand sleepiness as boredom. Spectacular of Passages can be a rich experience, and there are a number of strong moments. The album's so tight it has a tendency to close in on itself, but when you do duck your head inside there are plenty of, well, spectacular passages. Let me equivocate a bit more: I'd be curious to see what'd happen if Lubelski's magisterial sonic precision was taken for a more arresting ride-- more cracked, splintered, or rusted-- because what we have now is a beautiful, precious music box or curio that you won't be compelled to open that often.","Idyllic bedroom psychedelia takes pop orchestrations to previously unimagined levels of insulation.

The Departures EP,Meredith Bragg and The Terminals,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48fc0084474cd0c0500/1:1/w_160/6b9dba17.gif,2006-01-26 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1168-the-departures-ep/,Kora,"Not surprisingly, that title is literal. The five songs on D.C.-based Meredith Bragg and the Terminals' Departures EP all recount romantic break-ups and partings, but Bragg is much less concerned with messy heartbreak and recrimination than with holding off the inevitable departure and the daunting logistics of finally moving on-- what to do, where to go, and how to get there. On ""Empty Beds"", the EP's lead track, he asks, ""What will I do for Christmas?"" as a means of evoking the banal complications of a broken relationship. ""Postcard From Boston"" presumably picks up some time later, as Bragg tries to make peace with an ex over the phone. He's not shooting for immediate emotional impact on any of these songs, but for a particular resonance that will build with each listen. This musical and emotional pragmatism keeps Bragg from sounding whiny, maudlin, or precious-- although he occasionally veers close to all three. He tends to be a little self-absorbed, but such is the province of every white guy with an acoustic guitar. Bragg's songwriting has grown more acute since his debut, but more impressive is the development of his sound. His transparent emulation of Elliott Smith and Ben Gibbard on the group's 2005 debut, Volume 1, gave that album the feel of a rehearsal, and on Departures, which was recorded at famed Inner Ear Studios, that influence is definitely present. But Bragg relies on it much less, having apparently absorbed it and others into a more individual approach. As a result, Departures is a stronger, more assured statement, one that sounds much less imitative or tentative. Bragg's vocals, guitar playing, and songwriting remain squarely at the forefront, but the Terminals tease out the songs' moods expertly, creating and sustaining the EP's darkly intimate atmosphere. Elizabeth Olson's cello and Brian Minter's keyboards add gravity to the songs, and the two occasionally break out of their sideman roles: Olson slices her way through ""Let's Start Over"", neatly undercutting Bragg's softly assured melody with a more aggressive, almost percussive rhythm. And Jonathan Roth's perfectly mic'd drums drive ""Talk Me Down"" and ""Postcard from Boston"", allowing the songs to change form and tone mercurially. Departures ends with a cover of Songs:Ohia's ""Two Blue Lights"". It's not a very adventurous interpretation-- it doesn't take much to make a Jason Molina tune sound murky and mournful-- but it's still a fitting choice to end the EP, nicely echoing the theme of Bragg's songs while slyly realigning his stylistic roots, making Departures a bit of a departure itself.","Appropriately titled EP deals with holding off the heartbreak and daunting logistics of moving on after a breakup.

Amber,Clearlake,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ee9d034d5c69bf33fa/1:1/w_160/3e62182f.jpg,2006-01-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1496-amber/,Domino,"One can practically hear the crickets chirping in Clearlake's songs, so sylvan is their dreamy brit-rock. Amber, the band's third album, pits ostentatious instrumentation against a druthers for fiery guitar squall, elements they've never meshed this harmoniously before. Frequently gorgeous but over-lubed, the album forges soundscapes so lush they're almost narcotic. In a British rock scene suddenly governed by sexually frustrated Sheffield kids with a Lavigne-shallow understanding of the anvils on which they stand, Amber's yawns are a nice respite from the geeky frissons now being purveyed. The Hove foursome (bummer no Carters among them) come off mellow and sure-footed, maybe a little paternal. The band remembers life before Oasis, even before industrialization: Amber's best songs imagine atavistic, Tolkien-esque habitats, happily ignorant of history's looming smogsets. Even the title invites eco-friendly readings. You'd expect any album with such profligate nods to nature, and how cool it is, and how the modern world is scary, of packing an ideological strain. But frontman Jason Pegg spouts lover's vitriol as diligently as he casts granola melancholy. Risking sounding like a crybaby on Christmas, ""I Hate It That I Got What I Wanted"" details a strange affliction: remorse over getting what one wants. Pegg's reasoning? ""I don't want it anymore."" Fair 'nuff. Yet the words don't bother so much as the way they're delivered, Pegg essaying uptempo snarl, getting smothered by those ""whoa, dude, let it ring!"" Road Rash guitars. Better is the topsy-turvy ""It's Getting Light Outside"", whose pistoning, tympani-heavy rhythm provides a good context for Pegg's nasally, overearnest sing-song. ""You Can't Have Me"", even softer-hued, plays fuzzy gegenschein to the more importunate yowlers; the Fennesz-wet upbeat guitar pulses can't not encourage nostalgic reverie. Another way Amber foils expectations: For a band with such imaginative whimsy, Clearlake have a disappointingly staid invasion jones. ""Finally Free"" does its scuzziest nth-wave stomp, complete with tactical tambourine jiggles, aloof vox harmonies, and an insultingly simple guitar lick; cowbell's a continental aberration, probably a Pixies reference. Even worse is single ""Neon"", whose booming drum-and-harmonica rig wants to be Big & Rich, not fey British indie rockers. The album really shines when it's at its quietest, like when Pegg quavers trying to bridge the wide gap between ""Dreamt That You Died""'s baggy guitar chords. Never mind the song recycles Cedars standout ""Trees in the City"", only this time on some macabre quasi-personal folderol, not the original's unambiguous anti-concrete screed. Plugged-in but still drowsy, ""It's Getting Light Outside"" is the real gem, though, mainly because it understands that volume does not equate to energy in recorded music: post-chorus guitar spikes provide a twist-of-lime kick without rising above library volume. A word to British rock in '06: The frissons are great, but let's have more yawns.","English band unveils its third album of sleepy, sylvan pop, which harmoniously meshes fiery guitars and ostentatious instrumentation.

Omnibus,Tarkio,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b65e6ef9596932128c/1:1/w_160/a0c9d065.jpg,2006-01-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8312-omnibus/,Kill Rock Stars,"You would have lived the rest of your years completely and perhaps blissfully unaware of Tarkio if it weren't for the fact that the band's singer and primary songwriter was Colin Meloy, now president-for-life of the Decemberists. And honestly you wouldn't have been missing very much. Omnibus, Tarkio's two-disk catch-all wrap-up from Kill Rock Stars (now the Decemberists' former home), is full of the kind of well-meaning, basically bland acoustic rock that all college towns seem to produce in bulk. In fact, the music is so rooted in a very particular strain of college rock that it could conceivably have been recorded ten years earlier with ambitions to sit on student playlists alongside Guadalcanal Diary, the Ocean Blue, and Bread and Circus-era Toad the Wet Sprocket. Tarkio formed in Missoula, Montana, in 1996, after Meloy returned from a few semesters at the University of Oregon with a mind to change his major to English. Once settled, he recruited banjo player Gibson Hartwell, bassist Louis Stein, and drummer Brian Collins, and the band took its name from a nearby ghost town. Over just a few years, Tarkio recorded a few EPs-- most self-released, but one via Barcelona Records-- all of which are collected on Omnibus, along with a few previously unreleased tracks. Predictably, there's a lot of institutional guitar jangle in every song, along with some polite strumming, decent drumming, and Meloy's studious wordplay and lit-class allusions to Camus and The Sheltering Sky. Then as now, Meloy stands out. His now-familiar vocals and brainy lyrics elevate the group above the mass of uncelebrated college bands past and present, even if he sounds like an impressionable student just out of a stimulating lit class. There are intimations of the scamp he would become with the Decemberists; Omnibus even contains an early, less animated version of ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the latter band's 5 Songs EP. But this is definitely Meloy in his formative years, before all the sea shanties and chimbley sweeps and military homoeroticism, when he was just getting control of his humor and intelligence. In the liner notes, he dismisses these songs with a half-interested ""feh,"" preferring to think of them as a soundtrack to memories of camaraderie and teeth cutting. Meloy's greatest flaw was his apparent inability to self-edit. The 27 songs on Omnibus are uniformly overlong, most approaching or surpassing the five-minute mark when barely a handful have cause to exceed three minutes. You have to wash the dishes and put on your pajamas before these songs take the hint. This may seem like a minor gripe, but it seriously compromises the individual and cumulative effect of these songs. ""Caroline Avenue"", for instance, has a catchy chorus saddled to Hartwell's galloping as well as some of the band's cleverest lyrics (although I don't believe Meloy when he claims he's ""chasing shots of whiskey with everclear""), but drawn out to nearly six minutes, these elements lose their power and ultimately test your patience. Hartwell even admits as much in the liner notes that ""on some level maybe what works about these recordings is not what they are but, what they could have been."" They could have been shorter. Some songs, mostly from the 1998 release I Guess I Was Hoping for Something More, hint strongly at what the band could have become with a few more years to refine their chops. ""Helena Won't Get Stoned"" is a buoyant sing-along that must have been a blast at their live shows (especially in, ahem, Helena), but ""Candle"" was probably the closer, with its ambitious and dour guitar coda. ""Your Own Kind"" is a tongue-in-cheek, yet suspiciously persuasive, approximation of easy listening, and ""Standing Still"" cribs shamelessly but fairly successfully from R.E.M. Omnibus isn't arranged chronologically, which is a big check in the minus column. Presenting these tracks out of order severely skews the true story of the band, which seems like it should be a priority for such an artifact. This decision also means the second disc is weighed down with molasses-slow demos and live tracks like ""Tristan and Isolde"", which bears comparison to Dire Straits' much more piquant ""Romeo and Juliet"". The disc continues its dirge-like pace with tracks like ""Never Will Marry"" and ""Following Camden Down"", which seem to be sequenced to stop any momentum dead. On the other hand, these songs weren't recorded for this type of release, and bands like Tarkio aren't mean for widespread scrutiny. There's a reason every college town has their own acoustic rock group: They don't export well. Their appeal is entirely local-- not so much the music itself, which is easily reproducible, but the unique thrill of seeing people you know or could know up there on stage playing music. I'm not knocking it. For many budding musicians, writers, lovers, fans, and students, that connection can be just as inspiring as any motivational speaker or activist theatre troupe. As such, Tarkio fulfilled a specifically local function, and if you weren't enrolled at the University of Montana seven or eight years ago, listening to Omnibus may be disappointing, perhaps even a little intrusive. You may not get it, but it wasn't meant for you.","Early work from the Decemberists' Colin Meloy, this record collects the best from an indie-folk band he fronted during his days as an undergraduate in Montana.

"If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry",Marah,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3acea9e61561daa7f94/1:1/w_160/7426b6a7.jpg,2006-01-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5103-if-you-didnt-laugh-youd-cry/,Yep Roc,"Can you really blame boomer fud-duds like Nick Hornby and Stephen King for fawning over these Philly-bred dad-rock roustabouts? After all, brothers Dave and Serge Bielanko have made a semi-career out of tapping into the same classic rock mainlines-- ramshackle glory, me-against-whatever loner rebellion-- that defined such aging pundits' youth. ""There is still a part of me that persists in thinking that rock music, and indeed all art, has an occasional role to play in the increasingly tricky art of making us glad we're alive,"" wrote Hornby in a sycophantic Marah-boosting 2004 New York Times editorial. For him, these unshowered schmucks are the benevolent ghosts of rock & roll past, nudging his mind back to a time when his heart pumped more diligently. When ""alive"" meant living-- not looking back with nostalgia clouding the frame. So If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry isn't a bad album in the same way a '70s homeless-beard Bruce recreation at Madam Tussaud's isn't a bad work of wax sculpture. Marah may be fun to take silly pictures with but their fifth album continues to prove they're hardly interested in expanding upon the genuine articles they so lovingly revere. After a failed attempt to toy with their formula-- 2002's Britpop-a-go-go disaster Float Away With the Friday Night Gods-- the Bielankos and their rotating cast of shaggy placeholders again returned to the 70s with 20,000 Streets Under the Sky. IYDLYC, made of off-the-cuff live takes, is noticeably spunkier than its return-to-form predecessor, and the closest Marah have come to capturing the spontaneous energy of 2000's Kids in Philly. Like their Asbury idol, over time these boys have grown more reliant on traditional song structure rather than endless rambles. But when Springsteen condensed his free-wielding local tangents, he did so with an ambition and gusto that made every song distinct. There's no such striving here. Alongside ready-made Miller beer jingles (""The Closer"", ""Sooner or Later"") doleful, dumbed-down Dylan larceny (""The Dishwasher's Dream""), and the requisite tiresome underclass anthem (""Poor People""), Marah manage only two moments of transcendence. ""Walt Whitman Bridge"" recalls about 357 other memorable acoustic guitar/harmonica ditties but trumps most of them. You know what's up-- a lonely walk across a storied Philadelphia passageway, wind whipping, nicotine and caffeine warming insides, restless, loveless. The track indulges in the group's best kept secret: carefully calibrated vocal harmonies that make slight lines like ""Fall away from these winter streets/ On a cloudless day/ Your memory blows away from me"" sound newly discovered and poignant. Meanwhile, winsome ballad ""So What If We're Outta Tune (w/ The Rest Of The World)"" recalls Extreme's ""More Than Words"" in the best way possible. Of course, the it's-just-you-and-me-honey outlook is overwrought, but its naivety is becoming. Many of the song's lines also double as a bittersweet acknowledgement of Marah's endearing underdog status (""Strainin' our voices to no consequence...Dreaming out our choruses and slow sad middle eights""). Both songs beg to be centerpieces for future pivotal scenes in Cameron Crowe films. In a way, when Springsteen lent his guitar and vocal talents to Marah's ""Float Away"" four years ago, he fucked them. For a band whose existence is an exalted form of Boss worship, the guest spot seemed like a tribute band's final triumphant coup. Yet Marah go on singing sung songs while lifelong rock fans pretend not to remember them.","Latest from the Springsteen-aping Philly band.

Far Away Trains Passing By,Ulrich Schnauss,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37513d1975652138ac3/1:1/w_160/eb2556a3.jpg,2006-01-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7026-far-away-trains-passing-by/,City Centre OfficesCity Centre Offices,"For some reason Berlin's Ulrich Schnauss hasn't attained a level of recognition to match the easy likeability of his music. Maybe it's his pokey output-- two full-lengths in five years, and nothing since 2003. Maybe it's his name, which isn't as pleasing to the ear or as catchy as, say, M83. But Schnauss' two very different albums are obvious go-tos for someone looking for melodic IDM working within the framework of pop. We remember Schnauss last from 2003's A Strangely Isolated Place, a record that found him enveloped in a neo-shoegaze glow, allowing a reverence for Slowdive, first explored on his cover of ""Crazy for You"" from the Morr tribute album, to run wild. Relative to that widescreen odyssey of layered guitar, Schnauss started more simply. On his 2001 debut album, recently issued in the States for the first time with a bonus disc, he was practicing the sort of bubbly instrumental electro-pop Morr has made famous. Boards of Canada usually comes up when discussing this sound, but Schnauss' music is really too sunny and upbeat to warrant the comparison. There's no undercurrent of darkness or dread to be found on Far Away Trains Passing By; while the music might be described as ""cinematic,"" it would be a soundtrack to some bittersweet, but nonetheless uplifting, scene. Something about the texture of the synths and ascending chords suggests the dénouement of an 80s teen film, where the geek, while failing to get the girl, walks proudly into the distance with his self-esteem intact. Though there is some variety in the beats-- the ""popcorn"" electro percussion on ""Blumenwiese Neben Autobahn"", the loping groove of ""Nobody's Home"", whose warmth suggests a debt to Ultramarine-- the record as a whole is unified and consistent, moving steadily from one thoughtful little tune to the next. The bonus disc of B-sides, comp tracks, and the like is very much of a piece, suggesting that Schnauss was during this period working to master a very specific parcel of sonic real estate. He pretty much got there, but as the cover of ""Crazy For You"" included on the bonus disc makes plain, he had better things in store. For while Far Away Trains Passing By is a nice listen, this music begs for a riskier approach, something with bolder strokes and an infusion of drama that risks cheesiness.","First issued on City Centre, this ambient techno LP is expanded to a 2xCD set for its U.S. bow.

Boduf Songs,Boduf Songs,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4adea9e61561daa4f6e/1:1/w_160/708a7a60.jpg,2006-01-25 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1193-boduf-songs/,Blue BabyBlue Baby,"Fortifying the acoustic guitar market, solitary folkies continue their downer parade. One of the more alluring soloists is English bard Mat Sweet, who records as Boduf Songs. On his self-titled debut he shares a similar one-sheet with fellow countryman Duncan Sumpner, aka Songs of Green Pheasant, but where the latter plots a course through shimmering Simon & Garfunkel psychedelia, Boduf Songs wanders into gloomier terrain. Sweet resides in Southampton and runs the small imprint, Blue Baby Recordings, on which he first issued this LP as a CD-R. As such, he's self-released a number of his own projects, including Map of Hell's doom sludge, the ambient drone of Pistol At Dawn With Afterglow, and Four Man Ghost's fuzzed Mogwai post-rock. Other Sweet offshoots include Randolph Carter (yo, H.P. Lovecraft), Heavy Manufacturing Concern, and History of Electricity. As Boduf Songs, Sweet strums gently, darkening the sound with discreet bits of noise and desolate Current 93-style lyrics-- the opener, ""Puke a Pitch Black Rainbow to the Sun"", presents a good example of both inclinations (i.e. the death of summer lyrically; backward guitar smashed against dainty arpeggios). Standing in contrast to the album's Victorian cover art, these nine austere pieces drift by in less than 30 minutes. (Where Sweet does link with the ornamentation is his antiquarian language á la ""fallow fields"" and ""august fortunes""). Like Samara Lubelski, Sweet adds almost imperceptible touches-- more noticeably, there are the piercing feedback peals of what sounds like a bent saw on ""Claimant Reclaimed"" and bells woven into guitar rattles on ""Our Canon of Transportation"". Whatever the apparent similitude, piano, cymbals, bowed everything, and sheets of computer peals materialize over time. As with David Thomas Broughton, the slight gradations create a space for hypnosis; but while Sweet and Broughton share the downhearted William Blake thing, there's less rawness and pastoralism, more craven, craggy, and brooding meditation in Boduf Songs' whisper. His talent as an arranger offers various shades of black. The instrumental ""Our Canon of Transposition"" finds castanets or censors clanging against an ominous woodblock and reversed sound sheets. At one point, a murkier sound sinks the tone of the piece, introducing a more frantic edge to the construction. ""Lost in Forests"" pairs chirpy field recordings and Oren Ambarchi-style gleams (kind of like skipping dusty fractals across a brook). ""Vapour Steals the Glow"" lodges an underwater mallet into a drone scape and then broadcasts it over AM radio. These miscellaneous accents are beyond restrained, existing not so much as separate flourishes, but rather accrued, integrated details. This know-how is occasionally his undoing: Sweet enlarges his general sound here/there, but the sad sack whisper and brushwood guitar remain the same. The tempo's boosted with the raga instrumental, ""Ape Thanks Lamb""-- think Six Organs and the Sun City Girls-- but his preferred pace is encapsulated in the opening sigh and 1-2-3 of ""Oh Celebrate Your Vague Words and Coquettish Sovereignty"". It's that soporific Iron & Wine hemisphere. So while the album's a well-composed suite, the Catch-22 remains: Certain pieces suffer from too much uniformity. As mentioned above, the material's a couple of years old. From what I hear, there will be a new collection in the fall, and at that point-- two Boduf albums in hand-- it'll be interesting to assess Sweet's understated poetics, to uncover what connections bridge the final track of this collection and the dawn of his next chapter. For now, search out some opium and a black light and commence nodding.","Kranky reissues the debut LP from English bard Mat Sweet, originally released as a CD-R in 2004.

The Indian Tower,Pearls and Brass,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ab5e6ef9596932023b/1:1/w_160/4a23fe1f.jpg,2006-01-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6591-the-indian-tower/,Drag City,"It's difficult-- even for assiduous scholars of classic rock history (a breed that emphatically does not include yr correspondent)-- to write about unreconstructed modern versions of classic rock with any depth. Writers on classic rock tend to possess an abundance of trivia that can fill up word counts, and if these detailed minutiae often seem to convey more about the writer than about the music in question, due diligence can find fertile analytical territory in historical context and cultural memory. But if Cream and their ilk were a resonant moment, then modern facsimiles of same-- power trio Pearls and Brass, for instance-- are memories of resonance rather than resonance itself. But let's not talk about postmodernism for once. So we're left to name-check the appropriate touchstones and to devise new ways of describing the same thing-- power, weight, speed. ""No Stone"" crackles with thunderous tattoos of percussion, lacquered bolts of guitar that ladder vertiginously, and mannish blues-rock emoting. ""Black Rock Man"" sets woozy string bends pitching over plodding drums in a sort of darkly coursing, gritty sludge. ""I Learn the Hard Way"" is twangy, undistorted blues, authentically spacious, and ""Beneath the Earth"" is stoner rock, albeit not the kind that interacts with being stoned in a more interesting way than any other sonic stimulus, but the kind that's stoner rock because people who listen to it tend to be stoners. Such tautologies are endemic to modern classic rock. It's self-defining, a recursive circuit-- you can tell good rock from bad rock because the former rocks and the latter doesn't. I want music to interact with the moment we inhabit now, and the most frustrating thing to me about modern classic rock is how closed and final it seems, how unavailable to the living, breathing moment. Serious Rock Dude would argue that I'm over-thinking it, and he would be right. The correct response to The Indian Tower is to give one's limbic system over to it, blank-brained, but for me it's like watching a favorite movie I've seen too many times for its rehearsed drama to produce anything more than the mildest euphoria. Regardless, The Indian Tower rocks in the most literal sense of the word; if that means anything to you, it's really all you need to know.","Drag City power trio are another in a line of indie bands re-discovering the joys of classic rock.

The Brave and the Bold,Bonnie “Prince” BillyTortoise,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ab5e6ef9596932047f/1:1/w_160/58ada4d5.jpg,2006-01-25 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/705-the-brave-and-the-bold/,Overcoat,"A quick scan of Will Oldham's discography reveals a nasty penchant for perverting rules of identity, fiddling with listener expectations, and flipping shit upside down (check out 2004's Bonnie Prince Billy Sings Greatest Palace Music, where two of Oldham's many alter-egos battle for stylistic supremacy, pitting smooth pedal steel against scrappy acoustics). Oldham's latest effort, a collaboration with Chicago stalwarts Tortoise, is an equally unflinching testament to his shape-shifting jones: The Brave and the Bold collects covers of disparate artists, including Devo, Elton John, Richard Thompson, the Minutemen, Melanie, Bruce Springsteen, Lungfish, Don Williams, Milton Nascimento, and Quixotic, howled by Oldham while Tortoise churns incessantly in the background. Tortoise's long-acclaimed math-rock stylings remain intact throughout, and Oldham's voice is still all elbows and knees, dry and rangy, but The Brave and the Bold isn't necessarily predictable. Both artists maintain their signature sounds here, yet the pairing yields few particularly fiery or compelling results. Instead, classic songs are rearranged and reconsidered, stripped down and rebuilt-- theoretically, the results should be intriguing, but instead, The Brave and the Bold is mostly mediocre, benefiting from neither Oldham's expert songwriting nor Tortoise's experimental clash. The Brave and the Bold's version of ""Thunder Road"" is crushing and ominous, unapologetically divorced from Springsteen's fist-pumping highway anthem, and less a call to action than a proclamation of defeat, broken and sad, punctuated by plodding guitar and weird hisses. No matter how hard the band tries to distill its essence, the awesome, screaming glory of ""Thunder Road"" can't be culled from languished pronouncements like, ""Well I got this guitar/ And I learned how to make it talk."" All that charm is buried deep in Springsteen's undeniable, gorgeously adolescent cockiness, the promise of escape, the momentum of flight, the big moment, two minutes in, where the drums kick up and the backing vocals swell and Springsteen hollers ""Roll down the window!"" Rip that away, and ""Thunder Road"" becomes limp and awkward. The weird, feel-good thumps and scale-crawling of Devo's ""That's Pep"" are translated into fart-feedback and sped-up honks, with Oldham's vocals periodically seeped in thick, uncomfortable echo (although there's still something excellent about the way Oldham yells ""pep!,"" presumably with his eyebrows raised and hands in the air). Lungfish's menacing ""Love Is Love"" keeps much of its original shape, while the dancefloor smarm of Elton John's ""Daniel"" is traded-in for trademark Tortoise twitters, with Oldham's voice layered in effects and near-indecipherable; although Oldham's pipes could be a little less heavily treated (all that fuzz obscures classic Oldham nuance), ""Daniel"" is still the album's most successful rendition, somehow retaining all the grinning heart of the original, and giving Oldham a chance to dust-off his crazy falsetto. Ultimately, The Brave and the Bold is a collection of not-particularly-compelling cover songs, rolled out by two of contemporary indie's most uncompromising and rewarding forces. Or, in short: We all really wish this was better-- less tiring, less dour, less sluggish-- than it actually is.","Indie greats team for a covers album, which features interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, the Minutemen, Devo, and Elton John, among others.

Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case,BARR,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ae9d034d5c69bf3116/1:1/w_160/b2602853.jpg,2006-01-24 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1194-beyond-reinforced-jewel-case/,5RC,"BARR's Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case is one of the more bizarre discs I've come across recently. Brendan Fowler, the man behind the project, has been referred to as a motivational rapper, a comedian, even a performance artist. Not quite a beat poet, not quite a storyteller, he speak-sings strange little abstracts over simple drumbeats, low-mixed bass, and the occasional piano. Some tracks are funny, some sad; others are annoying or downright puzzling. Many of the songs here are conversational and personal. I'm reminded of Manhattan tour guide Timothy ""Speed"" Levitch in Bennett Miller's documentary The Cruise, who seems to speak to everyone and no one at once. Much like Levitch's pointed commentaries and criticisms, Fowler's words may leave the speaker and enter your ear, but often it is clear that he's really talking to someone very specific, possibly even himself. You're left listening to one side of a conversation about situations you're unfamiliar with and people you don't know. In ""Like, I Used to Like"" he complains, ""It made sense that she was stressed, the way that motherfuck-face gave her the runaround about her mortgage on her place. It really made me mad!"" This sort of random conversation is par for the course. At times, his lyrics are pseudo-philosophical. ""Anx-Worth It"" is a 48-second musing on recurring negativity, and how putting bad feelings on tape can at least make him feel less lonely the next time the feeling rolls around. Elsewhere the words are nostalgic, as if Fowler is reminiscing, recording memories before they slip away. ""Us"" is a sad, frustrated explanation of how his father's death relates to the BARR concept. He voices his concern about exploiting personal pain for music. ""He died and he's dead and what does that mean? What if it wasn't that way? It is what it is,"" he philosophizes. In a different setting, it may come off as pretentious or hokey, but in this stripped down, personal setting, it's more like your own inner dialogue than some dude trying to be poignant. It's difficult to look at Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case on the same terms as a CD of traditional music. The first time I gave it a spin, I groaned, wondering how painful it would be to get through. But by the second song I was engrossed, and I listened intently until it ended. So on the surface, it is an incredibly enjoyable listen. But when it comes to replay, I can't say I'm often moved to pop this in. It's not driving music, working music, party music, or background music of any kind. So, while it does offer a rich, unique listening experience, it unfortunately lacks staying power.","Odd yet striking work from Brendan Fowler, who has been referred to as a motivational rapper, a comedian, and a performance artist.

Beautiful Seizure,volcano!,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a89d034d5c69bf3cbf/1:1/w_160/d0b21cbf.jpg,2006-01-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8544-beautiful-seizure/,Leaf,"Beautiful Seizure is the debut album from Chicago art-rock trio volcano!, and it's full of unpredictable, volatile compositions that sweep varying styles and moods together like dry leaves before setting them ablaze. Singer and guitarist Aaron With yanks and pops at the strings while showing off his versatile voice, veering between gently lulling and operatic from song to song. While their many detours might have you thinking volcano! are freeform-- or worse, improvisational-- they're not out to destroy their songs. The melody underneath is always discrete, and the singer's croon is always grounded. After some tentative plucking and plinking in the opener, the cacophonous pummeling and wailing of ""Easy Does It"" slips in and out of time, making sudden stops for unhinged caterwauling replete with accordion. ""Fire Fire"" has a more fluid rhythm, beginning with a gorgeous anticipatory stall before the drums fade in and resuscitate a slippery post-rock specter, though not without a percussion break where With asks in a sinister whisper, ""What's in gonna take to get your freak on?"" before shredding the strings of his guitar. Over the floating chimes of ""40,000 plus interest,"" With gently wails about his broken-down minivan and the massive debt gathered from college, switches to Spanish for the unaccompanied vocal solo of ""La Lluvia"", and pulls out slam-poet inflection for ""Apple and a Gun"". The band doesn't just skirt pretension; Beautiful Seizure is a full-on wrestling match with it. But out of it all comes a stunning and consistently melodic middle ground that never teases or withholds anything, always sputtering towards catharsis without losing grip of the listener's hand. Even if With shows indulgence in the lyrics (or by reprinting them in fucking IPA on the band's Web site), it's forgiven and forgotten after hearing how sharp Volcano! are as a trio, yanking With up from ""$40,000"" by the scruff of his neck and tossing him into the marching chaos of ""Red and White Bells"", anchoring ""Apple and a Gun"" with an infectious two-chord stomp, and elevating the leaden title of ""Pulling My Face In and Out of Distortion, I Blink Too Much"" with a woozy horn section, almost inaudible above the arresting wreck of the finale.","Debut album from the Chicago art-rock trio is full of unpredictable, volatile compositions.

Singles & Sessions 1979-81,Delta 5,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbccea9e61561daa730c/1:1/w_160/56d1bd37.jpg,2006-01-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2633-singles-sessions-1979-81/,Kill Rock Stars,"As the sound of British new wave began to brighten the industrial North during the late 1970s, the city of Leeds earned a reputation as a salient point of response to the country's chronic economic recession. Tightly knit groups such as Gang of Four, the Mekons, and Delta 5 rose out of the realms of Leeds' universities and provided a social platform for its particularly politicized students. Ros Allen and Bethan Peters, both on bass and vocals, originally formed Delta 5 because they ""felt left out"" of the city's burgeoning music scene, although this apparent caprice quickly developed into reality with the addition of deadpan vocalist Julz Sale, guitarist Alan Riggs, and one-time Gang of Four drummer Kelvin Knight. Gang of Four received considerable recognition during this period, and they were name-checked throughout the recent post-punk revival. Despite Delta 5's musical similarity, the group remained on the sidelines, without much commercial success. This assortment of early Rough Trade singles, Peel sessions, and live recordings, shows just how effective the group's tense, barbed breed of dark pop was-- and it's a shame that this is only being fully recognized in hindsight. The disc opens with their first single and best known track, ""Mind Your Own Business"", and runs in chronological order through A and B sides, ending on an atypically visceral plea for individuality on ""Colour"". With their unusual, dub-heavy rhythmic section and acerbic stagger of triple female vocals, Delta 5 articulated a variety of textures and approaches to song structure. Riggs' guitar is particularly striking, providing an expressive attack of tones that cut through the sharp social commentary with stingingly sweet precision. And while the vocals have a distinctly monochromatic and disdainful edge, they are never devoid of character and the dialogue between the women is carried by their assertively sarcastic wit. This paradox of astringency and humor provides rich yet unsentimental facets for topics ranging from infidelity and feminism to suspicion. Most importantly, though, this is music you can really dance to-- tracks such as ""You"" and ""Triangle"" practically command movement from the listener from the first insistent beat. The purpose of Singles & Sessions is to document Delta 5's short existence in a coherent format, since most of their early vinyl is out of print. But the strength and vitality of this collection of songs is also a point of frustration. Had this been released as the group's album in 1981, instead of the over produced and comparatively weak See The Whirl?, Delta 5 would have created a debut as impressive and culturally resonant as Entertainment!. As it is however, this excellent compilation has given new life to a brief, great band almost lost within the fug of post-punk's prolific heyday.","Kill Rock Stars collects striking examples of the Leeds post-punk band's tense, barbed dark pop.

Crusades,The Plastic Constellations,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17ac0084474cd0bfdf7/1:1/w_160/3628449c.jpg,2006-01-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6543-crusades/,Frenchkiss,"Thought I needed a q-tip when I first heard Crusades-- record sounded muddy. Bad rip? Speakers fucking with me? Nah. The perennially ahead-of-the-curve Plastic Constellations' third album is just their first on a cushy budget, so it's easy to confuse the beefy high-fidelity for some Frenchkiss engineer's mistake. Anyone who listened carefully to Mazatlan and Let's War-- living wage gigs for minor-league labels-- caught making-do vibrations; between guitars chugged thin, drums played loud but hit weak, parts got buried or stood out bull's-eye obvious. But here the band made like architects and turned its limitations into resources, fattening with volume and part-doubling in lieu of reverb and filters. Their effort amounts to a convincing facsimile of a high school punk show for the ages. So cut the ""they only know one dynamic!"" guff and relish the hugeness of ""Phoenix and the Faultline""'s chordal introduction. Can we take a minute to acknowledge the big stupid gloriousness of standalone guitar chords? The Constys give us only six seconds before launching into a Manute Bol of a hook-- a lanky, impossibly long eighth-note riff that shouldn't be half as catchy, considering its length. The song paces Crusades, which hammers track upon track of staunchly guitar-centric riff-rock. ""The guitars will make the Earth shake,"" boasts ""Quixote"". Hardly-- Sunn O))) these guys ain't-- but that track's piano-dripping trapeze act of a chorus might raise a few dead, while ""Iron City Jungles"" aims its jackknifing guitars with riot-inciting intent. Here's a band that lives and dies by anthemic riffs, yet understands perfectly the hollowness of their gestures. Even (or especially) Crusades' best licks have difficulty connecting with their rank-and-file underpinnings. ""Sancho Panza""'s Big Harmony chorus refuses resolution, alienating itself from the verse, but in a winning way. Swinging ""Men in Dark Times""'s triumphant outro is like taking guacamole on your turkey-and-swiss-- terrible idea, hard to refuse. But conviction and technical certainty enable Plastic Constellations to play off, as a kind of no-regrets transient indulgence, the chiffon rapture of even their most blustery lines. Anyway, rarely do albums come this taut anymore-- 35 minutes, no acoustic pussyfooting or tortoise-tempo sensitive moments. Yes, Crusades is a consistent album, staggeringly so. Ha, no see that's not an inherently good thing! I'll shy from ""heard it once, heard it all"" derision, but Crusades corrects some of Mazatlan's most compelling failings, like its done-on-the-cheap warmth or its penchant for sloppy genre-hopping. Instead we get expertness in place of exuberance, a trade off even green-faced basement-rehearsing post-punk wunderkinds must make eventually. So how to subsume the 20-something set without estranging the kids? Learn some dynamics I guess.","Anthemic indie band goes for expertness in place of pure exuberance on its Frenchkiss debut.

"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not",Arctic Monkeys,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d8ea9e61561daa48c7/1:1/w_160/fac45880.jpg,2006-01-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/497-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not/,Domino,"On Monday, the Arctic Monkeys sold 118,501 copies of their debut album in the UK, more than the rest of the top 20 combined. It's a startingly high figure not just because they're set to be the Biggest New Band Since Oasis but because of the speed with which they've gatecrashed their nation's public consciousness, going from unknown indie band to No. 1 on the singles charts in roughly six months. Much of the credit for that quick rise is rightly given to the power of the internet: The then-unsigned band first caught the public ear when its demos circulated last year. The Sheffield quartet eventually signed with Domino and the label wisely hosted the buzzmaking tracks, a move that allowed anticipation for the group's studio recordings to spread rather than stall. Two No. 1 singles, a few breathless reviews, and a load of thinkpieces about how The Internet Will Change Music Forever later and in the UK the Arctic Monkeys are suddenly the biggest band of the decade. It would be nice to think that a democratized music industry would mean the kids are tossing up alternatives to what they're already getting, but the Arctic Monkeys are, at their heart, the same sort of meat'n'potatoes guitar rock that has dominated the UK since the emergence of the Strokes, if not Oasis. They're a band that neatly sums up what's already selling, and in a relatively condensed media market the group was always going to be a hit; what's changed is that they were pegged quickly, mainlined to their target market and the UK mainstream press and radio for six months, then called an organic success story. (America, don't get smug: Your biggest download success to date is ""My Humps"".) And context still matters: When Oasis or the Strokes rolled into town, they were breaths of fresh air, antidotes to a lack of swagger or hooks or artists who wanted and deserved to be rock stars; Arctic Monkeys are yet another in a string of buzzsaw guitar bands with Northern accents. What's meant to be different about them are sometimes keenly expressive lyrics and that irresistible backstory. The band's more starry-eyed backers compare their hardscrabble tales to those of predecessors such as the Specials, Smiths, Pulp, and the Streets. But wringing lyrics from the everyday or articulating the dissatisfaction of many is risky and difficult business and, unlike those listed above, the Monkeys aren't so much spinning deft tales of quotidian anxiety as just complaining about their first steps into nightlife, run-ins with bouncers, cops, and schoolmates. So they're the UK's emo, painting diaristic portraits of small-town and suburban life for teens in a country where fundamentalism is allegiance to a soccer club rather than religion. Hey, fair play to them-- first steps into nightlife, run-ins with bouncers, cops, and schoolmates, these should be the worries in their lives, and of their peers they're among the best at addressing them. Almost everything that's appealing about Arctic Monkeys is down to singer Alex Turner, who possesses a gritty voice that gets increasingly appealing the more he allows it to stretch and wander. On sharp, observational, and detail-heavy Saturday Night and Sunday Morning tracks like the ""Red Lights Indicate Doors Are Secure"", ""Mardy Bum"", and ""Riot Van"" the band justifies taking their album name from the kitchen-sink drama. (Though it's still terrible-- alas, Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down was already taken). Outside of naming their record, when the band stumbles it's typically when they're fumbling around with women (""Dancing Shoes"", ""Still Take You Home"") or complaining about the onset of fame (the dreadful ""Perhaps Vampires Is a Bit Strong But...""). The singles are a mixed bag. The Five Minutes With... EP's ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" is a witty call to arms, a plea for bands that say something about their lives, but ""From the Ritz to the Rubble""'s whining almost makes you want to side with the bouncers. Of the Monkeys' starmaking tracks, neither sounds like a No. 1, let alone the first sounds from a burgeoning sensation: ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" grates every other time I listen to it; better is the offbeat ""When the Sun Goes Down"", the only track here that's three-dimensional structurally as well as lyrically. Should the band release album closer ""A Certain Romance"" as its next single, the hit/miss ratio will be greatly improved. A long sigh about living among chavs, ""Romance"" finds the Monkeys moving between bloody-knuckled and wistful as they paint a picture of boredom breeding violence, of being aware of the faults and faultlines in their environment but feeling too powerless or hemmed in by loyalty to raise a fuss. It's a neat summation of both the band's m.o. and a teenage life characterized by existential drift and geographic claustrophobia. And in the end then this is about teenage life-- and a pretty specific type of teenage life at that. NME editor Conor McNicholas told The Guardian last year that ""there's a big sofa supermarket by Doncaster train station. I always look at it and think someone's got a Saturday job there, they're 17, they're stuck in Doncaster and they fucking hate it-- that's the person we're publishing for."" I'd guess that to a disaffected, chavbaiting 17-year-old from Doncaster (or Rotherham, or Hull...) this is the perfect soundtrack to moving loveseats around a stock room. Fittingly then the NME awarded this album a 10/10. To the rest of us, however, the album is at times charming, oddly affecting, and certainly promising but understandably something less than life changing.","Their LP was only released two days ago but these Sheffield teens are already considered the UK's biggest new band since Oasis.

The Tour"" trotted Providence heroes Lightning Bolt and Arab on Radar around the country, sparking a wave of jaw-gaping press coverage. But if that was The Year Noise Broke, it was also the year Arab on Radar Broke-- squabbling, disbanding, and eventually dispersing into two neighboring camps sharing only the old 'Graft home. The Chinese Stars, which combined AOR vocalist Eric Paul and drummer Craig Kureck with former Six Finger Satellite guy Richard Ivan Pelletier, dropped first with Turbo Mattress in 2003, and struck again over the summer with another EP, T.V. Grows Arms; now Made in Mexico, featuring Radar refugee guitarist Jeff Schneider, get their crack at the post-post-rock spoils. In their heyday, Arab on Radar looked a strong Devo influence in the eye and said, ""Yes, but we are still men."" A semen-obsession followed, detouring only for sodomy (and hard-ons). While they irked some with misogyny and scatology, worse was nihilism so thick it denied ""Satisfaction"" no matter where it came from. Undoing what Devo had already undone, they ended in a gimmick bind so thick that their constricted and jerky on-stage shtick read as metaphor. The Chinese Stars, last checked, were digging deeper into this kind of nothingness; on Zodiac Zoo, Made in Mexico have only begun to U-turn out of the dirt. Arab on Radar walked the walk but backed down like schoolyard bullies; their website, circa 9/12, read, ""In light of the events now taking place at this point in history Arab on Radar feel that it is important that we address the issues surrounding our band's name."" Made in Mexico, another nominal provocation, here stuck to its guns. ""Clockwork"" deadpans on Erase Errata basslines, but brakes for the breakdown: ""We're keeping the rich and fat/ Rich and fat/ And the ones more meek/ And the ones misused/ Are the trash."" Singer Rebecca Mitchell stutters halfway between the raw enunciation of Lydia Lunch and something more sweet-- maybe 'cause she knows it helps. ""Farewell Myth"" puts it like, ""They don't need words/ They have voice/ Through their terms they organised/ By their terms they rise so high;"" this is why she screams one half and sings the other. But the other three dudes (in true Radar fashion) still shuck and jive in and out of Schneider's trademark aluminum-necked, metal on metal on metal screech. The chaos, with its ping-ponging bass and snare doubling every guitar hit, wears out what's worn out: ""Infrared Eye"" rips on a low-chugged bass, ""Occams Razor"" rides shotgun on the same idea, ""Solanas"" buries it. Only once do they lose the straightjacket for solos and free association, on ""Face of the Earth"", which unchains the high-end from the poor carthorse 1 2 3 4 repetition it's been stuck to since Schneider learned guitar from whatever factory machine taught him. Big up noise that remains loyal to rock's two- or three-minute mark. But constantly just fucking sound jeopardizes what they look to save (songs, about stuff, I think). ""Black Rabbit"", according to Schneider, means to be ""the 21st Century answer to 'White Rabbit' now that we are sure the world is not going to survive much longer"": Dudes, stop trashing what taught you to trash.","Former Arab on Radar guitarist Jeff Schneider leads this noise-rock combo.

What Are You On?,East River Pipe,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbebabf31b7dc7155bd7/1:1/w_160/6c8cc8b7.jpg,2006-01-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2660-what-are-you-on/,Merge,"On 1999's The Gasoline Age, F. M. Cornog-- the man behind East River Pipe-- caught his reflection in a shiny pimpmobile paint-job and the glare of store windows lit by garish neon signs. He focused his withdrawal-fueled desires and fears on the gleaming surfaces around him, vividly evoking a rootless urban lifestyle and creating an impossibly absorbing and accidentally amazing album, the kind that springs more from luck than from intention. Adding to its mystique, The Gasoline Age seemed to extend directly from Cornog's backstory: He had been homeless and drug-addled for years, until a friend took him in, cleaned him up, encouraged his songwriting, bought him his signature Tascam 388, and eventually married him. It's a well-deserved happy ending to a once-sad tale, even if Cornog continues to live in the shadow of The Gasoline Age. Two albums and nearly six years later, he's presumably cleaned up and more stable but still conflicted on the subject of drugs. What Are You On?, his sixth album, lives up to its title: It's full of drug songs, cruel kiss-offs, and oddball robot odes, all awash in his signature synth-heavy sound. That relatively lo-fi aesthetic remains surprisingly durable and idiosyncratic, especially on the doo-wop space anthems ""Crystal Queen"" and ""I'll Walk My Robot Home"". Compared to these more whimsical songs, drug ballads like the title track, ""Druglife"", and ""Some Dreams Can Kill You"" sound dour and defensive. Cornog's old life obviously still haunts and inspires him, but What Are You On? nevertheless lacks a real subject. Unlike The Gasoline Age, this album has nothing for him to fixate on, no intermediary to connect all of his notions and needs. These songs are more direct-- and that isn't necessarily a good thing. What Are You On? bristles with unchecked bitterness that often curdles into condescension. Like to read The Wasteland? Well, Cornog thinks you're a tool: On ""What Does T. S. Eliot Know About You?"" he answers his own question by declaring, ""He knows absolutely nothing/ But you talk and talk as if he do."" Never mind that such a sentiment seems to miss a larger point about making and experiencing art (including his own), but that curmudgeonliness infects nearly all these songs, especially ""The Ultrabright Bitch"" and ""You Got Played, Little Girl"", which bridle with hostility. Without something to catch Cornog's reflection and refract his frustrations-- to make him seem human-- What Are You On? is a deeply unfriendly album.","Merge issues the latest from singer/songwriter F.M.

"Sun, Sun, Sun",The Elected,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcee13d197565213b41d/1:1/w_160/d140b34e.jpg,2006-01-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2902-sun-sun-sun/,Sub Pop,"If Bright Eyes has, at times, been the Hank Williams of indie-country-- sonically hardscrabble, unadorned, and resolutely traditional-- then Blake Sennett must be its Kenny Chesney. His music with the Elected is just that affable, outrageously fun in a schmaltzy way, spit-polished, and trouser-creased. Sun, Sun, Sun is a modern pop simulacrum of traditional country, devoid of the electro accents that pocked the last Elected record, pretty delectable as long as you've a strong taste for ham. If Sun can even be called Country & Western, the emphasis should be firmly planted on the dextral side of the ampersand, given the songs' bright and spotless Califormica surfaces. As Sennett dreamily contemplates getting away from something or other, the jolly melancholy of ""Would You Come with Me"" is telegraphed by silvery string-bends gliding through its gentle twang; ""It was Love"" glints with moony lap-steel courtesy of Mike...Bloom (thought I was going to say ""Mogis"", didn't you?). If the emotions are earnest, the glitzy presentation makes them seem fake in the same way that Las Vegas plasticizes desire. But the swoony pop frissons come fast and often enough that you don't really have to dwell on it. By combining the penetrating wussiness and mincing prosody of Elliott Smith with the emo theatrics and big sappy choruses of Conor Oberst (check out the sculpted, harmony-drenched surges of ""Not Going Home""), Sennett has turned out an album of sparkly country slow-dances that sound at once utterly artificial and genuinely beguiling. ""Did Me Good"" is genre exercise in charming kitsch, with its barrelhouse pianos, jaunty organs, and saxophone-flourishes answering Sennett's titular refrain. It's winning in a way that seems canned, an emotional laugh-track, and it's hard to not feel a little violated by its relentless pageantry. Sennett's aesthetic is less problematic when he sticks to maudlin anglicanisms: ""But man I loved/ Yeah I loved/ When I loved/ It was love."" Simple and credible, endearingly obvious and courageously scoffable. This is country music that mythologizes the affluent 'burbs and their attendant heartaches more than those of impoverished backwater outposts, and when Sennett sings faux-soulful lines like ""That's all right, Jack"", it scans as equal parts young-white-dude-irony and young-white-dude-longing-for-authentic-experience, which isn't necessarily an attractive combination. But for what it's worth, while it seems as if the former child-actor has only outgrown half of the hyphenation, the aforementioned conflict is probably the realest thing to be found on Sun, Sun, Sun.","Blake Sennett creates a modern pop simulacrum of traditional country, devoid of the electro accents that pocked his most recent record.

IAO Chant From the Cosmic Inferno / Cosmic Funeral Route 666,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff55e6ef9596931fe4b/1:1/w_160/86ba4cea.jpg,2006-01-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11623-iao-chant-from-the-cosmic-inferno-cosmic-funeral-route-666/,Ace Fu,"Whatever changes have occurred in the galaxy of Acid Mothers Temple, the group has remained perpetually active. So in 2005, when various departures and line-up changes finally prompted group leader Kawabata Makoto to put the project Acid Mothers Temple and the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. on indefinite hiatus, the last thing to expect from him was prolonged silence. And true to form, Makoto quickly reloaded his supporting cast and unleashed his new ""hellchild,"" the Cosmic Inferno, and continued to build upon what is already one of the most unruly catalogs in existence. Even with AMT's hell-bent release schedule, however, Makoto has always seen the wisdom in making the occasional grand statement. And by all earmarks, the massive IAO Chant From the Cosmic Inferno would appear to be just such a momentous occasion. Recorded as a tribute to the late Pierre Moerlen of the hippie art-rock collective Gong, IAO Chant consists of a single 51-minute track, the monumental ""Om Riff From the Cosmic Inferno"". Part Vision Creation Newsun trance and part Hawkwind celestial blast furnace, this piece provides a perfect showcase for the Cosmic Inferno's ferocious revamped rhythm section of bassist Tabata Mitsuru (formerly of Zeni Geva) and dual drummers Shimura Koji (White Heaven) and Okano Futoshi. As with any epic work, the question isn't how long this song is but how long it feels-- and the further the listener can last before starting to glance impatiently at the clock, the better. In that regard IAO Chant is a smashing success-- every time I've listened, the track has been well into its second half before I'm tempted to sneak a peek at the stopwatch. Following a brief droning intro, the streamlined quintet lock their teeth intractably into the ""Om Riff"" and thrash it with a potent, single-minded focus not seen on an AMT release since their mesmeric 2002 take on Terry Riley's In C. Formidable as the rhythm section is, Makoto and electronics chief Higashi Hiroshi are still able to cover every available surface, their head-melting distortion suspended overhead like white-hot stalactites. Like many previous AMT studio offerings, one wishes that the bottom end was given a bit more authority in the mix, but there are few problems in the production that can't be corrected by liberally increasing the volume. Even grainier is the recording quality of Cosmic Funeral Route 666, a limited edition studio album released to coincide with the Cosmic Inferno's 2005 European tour. This album again finds AMT taking the longview on the pixilated 38-minute title track, but unlike the vibrant unity of ""Om Riff"", here each member of the collective seems eager to stretch the free-form music in an opposing direction. As such it covers a wider variety of terrain, layered heavily with the group's familiar Roger Corman sci-fi sound effects, and featuring a lengthy folkish drone interlude supplied by Makoto's bouzouki and tambura. As counterbalance to this extended interstellar ramble, the album also includes the brief, raging ""Phantom Fire Ball"", a Blue Cheer-inspired roar that seemingly intends to beat Boris or Comets on Fire at their own noisy game. It's on this full-throttled outburst that the distance between the Cosmic Inferno and past Acid Mothers Temple incarnations seems the widest. And amid reports that Makoto plans to return The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. to full operation later in 2006, one can only hope that he'll also find time to fit further sessions with the rowdier, more propulsive Cosmic Inferno into his already overbooked schedule.","Kawabata Makoto's group, now backed by the Cosmic Inferno, continues to be as prolific and awe-inspiring as ever.

Rabbit Fur Coat,Jenny Lewis With the Watson Twins,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf2eb335119a49ecfb4/1:1/w_160/6406e354.jpg,2006-01-23 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4998-rabbit-fur-coat/,Team Love,"Linda Ronstadt never got hung up on writing her own material. When she found a song she liked, she sang it, and nobody complained that her biggest hits were covers. Jenny Lewis, armed with a lovely voice and too little material, should have taken the same route. On her solo debut and her most soul/country record to date, Lewis' vocals sparkle and the intimate performances make a great first impression, but ultimately, the material grounds her. The production is arresting: The engineers-- primarily Bright Eyes guy Mike Mogis-- are always ready for Jenny Lewis' close-ups, from the soaring a cappella opening track to the acoustic ballads, where they adoringly catch the strengths and nuances of her crisp, clear alto. The Watson Twins also earn their album co-credit with big gospel harmonies. (And the twin thing doesn't hurt: dig their Shining-esque pose on the front cover.) The twins are a winning addition to every song on which they appear, although they sound so good that you start to take them for granted. It's not that they sound good here, so much as they would sound good anywhere; they could back up Khanate and still turn heads. But on repeated listens, the songwriting makes the album lukewarm. The melodies feel textbook, and the lyrics disappoint; they're often unwieldy (like the flurries of multisyllabic words on ""You Are What You Love"") or vaguely nonsensical (the title song seems heartbreaking, but just try to parse it). This material lacks the grace or the wit that could make the songs sizzle: a line like, ""When you're sleeping with someone who doesn't get you/ You're gonna hate yourself in the morning,"" lacks the clean punch of, say, ""I may hate myself in the morning/ But I'm gonna love you tonight."" (It's not even a ""This One's for the Girls"".) While the spare acoustic arrangements suit Lewis' voice, they don't lend themselves to the hooks and idiosyncracies that made Rilo Kiley. Lewis put far more on the line in her band's ""I Never"", and although that song has a bit of kitsch, its ruby red cowboy boots stomp on the toes of most of this album. In fact, more than any indie country album in months, Rabbit Fur Coat makes me question why indie singers put on their cowboy hats in the first place. The classy folk and Americana that Lewis invokes here never goes deeper than an aesthetic decision, and she's better at talking about bad times than bringing them to life-- or making them go away. That's also why the lone cover on the record, of the Traveling Wilburys' ""Handle With Care"", doesn't bug me. Some Fork staffers hate this cut with a burning bile, especially when Lewis invites Conor Oberst, Ben Gibbard, and M. Ward to sit by her campfire and share the vocals. I just think it's cute that the quartet set themselves up as aged Bob Dylans or Roy Orbisons-- even if it's an easier sell to aim a few years younger and call them our generation's Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Stephen Stills, and, of course, Linda Ronstadt.","Rilo Kiley leader steps out on her own with an indie-yuppie soul/country record released via Conor Oberst's Team Love label.

Black Acetate,John Cale,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d2c0084474cd0c0597/1:1/w_160/41224623.jpg,2006-01-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1228-black-acetate/,Astralwerks,"Throughout John Cale's storied 40-year career-- whether as a member of Velvet Underground, as a solo artist, or alongside such collaborators as Terry Riley or Brian Eno-- his work has always been so reliably eccentric and inventive that even his all-too-frequent misfires have held a certain peculiar fascination. Nevertheless, it comes as a disappointment to hear on Black Acetate how readily Cale has moved from the role of unsatisfied innovator to that of willing follower. Claiming the likes of Pharrell, Gorillaz, and Dr. Dre as primary influences, here Cale squanders whatever momentum he accrued on the estimable avant-pop of 2003's HoboSapiens by adorning these new songs with such unflattering, generic alternarock textures that they often render their author unrecognizable at best, and irrelevant at worst. Recorded with the assistance of Herb Graham, Jr. (who has worked with Macy Gray) and Mickey Petralia (Beck, the Dandy Warhols, Eels) the arrangements on Black Acetate regularly abandon the orchestrated nuance of Cale's past work in favor of sallow trip-hop beats and restrained post-grunge guitars. It's an approach that makes unadvisably forceful demands of Cale's irritable, overspent larynx. Never a powerhouse vocalist, here Cale ignores the limitations of his voice to inhabit these tracks with an ambitious role-playing swagger. Black Acetate opens inauspiciously with the daffy lite-funk of ""Outta the Bag"", on which Cale exercises his best Midnite Vultures falsetto. Although this track clearly plays well against Cale's established strengths, it at least suggests him to be in high spirits, which is more than can be said for the bizarre trailer-park mutter of ""Brotherman"". Over a clunky, dispiriting pulse he announces himself ""very uncomfortable, but you're feeling it/ I could write reams of this shit everyday,"" a puzzling claim that seems unfortunately quite possible. Even more discouraging are cynical, self-conscious ""rock"" cuts like ""Sold-Motel"" or ""Perfect"", with their neo-Candlebox riffs and trite lyrics (""You're perfect for me right now/ It's a different kind of love"") that are enough to make one nostalgic for Cale's late-70s paramilitary phase. Thankfully, ornately balanced tracks like ""Satisfied"", ""Inaflood"", and ""Wasteland"" restore a little dignity and help prevent Black Acetate from being a total washout. Not coincidentally, it is on these pieces that Cale and his collaborators are most able to integrate the viola-fed sophistication of past triumphs like Paris 1919 into these polished new surroundings. Ever the restless explorer, on these highlights Cale proves still capable of hitting literate, atmospheric marks that few of his peers can match-- and hopefully he'll soon come to realize that he's traveled as far as necessary on Black Acetate's borrowed, ill-fitting wings.","Disappointingly tame effort from the usually unpredictable Welshman.

Film School,Film School,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec65e6ef959693232d0/1:1/w_160/00f32cde.jpg,2006-01-22 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3355-film-school/,Beggars Banquet,"Film School's new self-titled atmospheric-rock effort isn't a debut, but it might as well be. Since originating in 1998 as essentially a solo project, the San Francisco outfit has swelled to a quintet, trading in the rotating cast of players from 2001's A Brilliant Career (which included ex-Pavement guitarist Scott Kannberg) for a steady lineup. Like many proper debuts, Film School comes on the back of well-received demos and EPs, and it finds a band shaping an anthemic presence-- in this case, brooding post-goth awash in layered shoegaze squalls-- even if the anthems aren't quite there yet. Despite a debt to such early-90s Brits as Slowdive, Film School's basis in the gloomier undercurrents of the current 80s-revival zeitgeist provides an easy retort to the misguided ""too soon"" complaints that met fellow Valentine-bloodiers like Ambulance Ltd., Skywave, and Serena Maneesh. The biggest departure from Brilliant Career, ""11:11"", rattles with a hip-jerking Joy Division or Interpol riff, while first single ""On & On"" sweeps from dark Echo & the Bunnymen dreamscapes to skittering hi-hats and crumbling guitars. Faster tunes like ""Harmed"", ""Pitfalls"", and especially ""Breet"" share deceptively bouncy guitar lines with the Cure or stellastarr* amid the murk and cinematic distortion. At times, Film School achieve a foggy, grandiose psychedelia, but their compositions aren't always as shimmering as their production. Ethereal near-ballads ""He's a Deep, Deep Lake"" and ""Sick of the Shame"" are portentous in scale, spreading out over dramatic dynamic shifts and indistinct lyrics, but neither quite earns its five-minute-plus length. Elsewhere, the backward-looping effects and swirling keyboards of the untitled opener and two-minute near-instrumental ""Garrison"" pale beside the more ambitious use of similar elements on Blur's ""Caramel"" or Talk Talk's ""New Grass"". This diversity makes Film School difficult to pigeonhole, and that's to their advantage even when the results still don't blaze trails. Penultimate ""Like You Know"" starts with gossamer noise before a prominent acoustic guitar places its wistful sentiment somewhere between ""Range Life"" and Elbow. Another of Film School's stronger songs is finale ""P.S."", a retread from 2003's Alwaysnever EP that floats a lazy Casio between the stuttering do-do's of founding member Krayg Burton, whose nonchalant Northern California mumbles conjure an unironic Stephen Malkmus. ""I'll end with a perfect splash today,"" Burton sings, diving into an overdriven guitar coda that hints at post-graduate promise.","Now a quintet, the Bay Area band follows a handful of well-received demos and EPs with this LP of atmospheric rock.

Elf-Titled,The Advantage,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a198ea9e61561daa4837/1:1/w_160/b743b282.jpg,2006-01-22 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/438-elf-titled/,5RC,"It's possibly the closest thing we '76-'81er males have to a shared generational experience: sitting on a worn shag basement carpet, desperately trying to unravel impossible black wire knots, unsheathing the cartridge and superstitiously blowing supposed dust or dirt from its connectors, plugging it into the console, flash, flash, repeat. These days, that same age group is a high supplier of dudes in bands, and as such, it's no surprise to find the Nintendo Entertainment System's early game soundtracks exerting an influence on modern music. The unique sound produced by the console has lately been emulated by representatives from all genre corners, be it indie rock (Fiery Furnaces, Deerhoof), electronic music (Max Tundra, Jason Forrest), or hip-hop (Diplo's remix of Ludacris' ""What's Your Fantasy?""). In most cases, those blips and beeps don't seem to be mere nostalgia exploitation, but rather evidence of NES music's lingering subconscious influence, musical touchstones as familiar as Beatles references were for an earlier generation of artists. The Advantage, of course, represent the most literal faction of this phenomenon, with their four-piece instrumental rock covers of assorted level themes and boss music. Far from being the only band practicing this approach (see also: the Minibosses, the Power-Ups, NESkimos, etc.), they're nevertheless the NES translators with the most star-power, featuring one half of Hella and assorted other noise-scene moonlighters. But where some practitioners of 8-bit revival coast along on kitsch, the Advantage do more than just tickle your retro bone-- an, erm, advantage that was hinted at on their self-titled 2004 platter and is brought to full realization here on the cutely-named Elf-Titled. Substantially upgrading the fidelity, and stepping away from the more obvious titles they've already covered-- your Marios, Zeldas, and Bubble Bobbles-- Elf-Titled is more stylistically explorative than their reflective, scrapbooky debut. Game composers designed music that was meant to loop infinitely without growing tiresome too quickly, resulting in brilliantly complex, maze-like melodies that the Advantage are all too happy to make their own. With guitars executing tightly choreographed, noodly maneuvers through songs like Bomberman 2's ""Wiggy"" or the music from the ""Metal Man"" stage of Mega Man 2, the band amps up the originals to reveal the songs as more than just background jingles. Hella's Spencer Seim bears the heaviest interpretive burden, stepping up the drumwork on tunes that were, by necessity, percussively challenged. While his contributions to the first album sometimes sounded unnecessarily rackety, more restrained playing and production tricks keep his kit from overshadowing the melodies here, as with the thick echo taking the gravity out of the dreamy ""Metroid: Kraid's Lair"". But ""Solar Jetman: Braveheart Level"" demonstrates that fuller drumming can also beef up a song's potential, turning the thin original into a heroic, driving march. It's inevitable that the Advantage will eventually run out of NES soundtracks worthy of revival and renewal. But the surprisingly majestic run through the much-beloved Duck Tales' ""Moon Theme"" and the weirdly Tortoise-like take on a song from Air Fortress suggest the Advantage don't need to stop when the games are sucked dry, indicating that they've hit upon a kind of post-rock sound that isn't saddled with that genre's predilection towards joyless pretensions. The next step is obviously to write original music in the vein of unsung NES composers' melodic pretzels, a task the Advantage themselves may or may not be equal to. But by reimagining the 8-bit ditties lodged deep in our memory banks as electrified indie-prog, the band is opening the door to less direct explorations of its generation's hidden canon.","Second album of covers of classic video-game music from the 5RC-signed quartet.

Take Jason Zumpano, Sparrow frontman and former drummer for the mid-90s power pop outfit that shared his last name, as well as Destroyer. His band's self-titled debut was as flimsy and unremarkable as the band name would suggest-- a drab foil for former bandmate Carl Newman's flashy, ever-so-jubilant New Pornographers. Fortunately, a new label and better backing gives Sparrow a shot in the arm, and The Early Years feels more complementary to Newman's works rather than a degenerate version of it. Lacking Newman's jaw-dropping twee-pop chops, Zumpano's arrangements hinge on efficiency and quaintness. Opening track ""Flower"" best showcases this damage control; horns, strings, and thumping ivories prop up Zumpano's thin croon, and the song's sweeping shuffle breathes life into the band's nostalgic musk. For the cherry on top, Zumpano tweaks his sometimes simplistic lyrics, further shrouding the otherwise straightforward pop songs with a layer of mystique. ""Flower"" culminates with the frustrated ""Why can't I see past the head of a flower?/ Why can't it be just the same?"", a vast improvement from previous lyrical quips like ""You are gone, and I am happy."" Sparrow's wholesome 60s flavor can come across as distractingly retro. The title track's melody rips ""Classical Gas"" though keeps chugging along until Zumpano co-opts the hook for himself. Lush bridges and spontaneous breakdowns also help to spice up the samey verse-chorus-verse formula. ""I Wouldn't Mind"" is a sprawler for Sparrow, almost hitting five minutes thanks to a dramatic, Picaresque symphony interlude. ""So Far From Me"" further blurs the classic pop edges as sharp harmonies and languid violins loom like Elliott Smith-sized storm clouds over the beaming, carefree chorus. All in all, The Early Years aims mid-level and consistently hits the target. The mostly mid-tempo track list creates a pervading coziness, each song melting unnoticeably into the next. Of course, the album's more than an old comfy afghan. Zumpano's newfangled hankering for melody sublimates the band's sound, propelling him from a what's-his-face Carl Newman associate to Jason Zumpano, former Carl Newman bandmate and singer of a pretty good band.","Absolutely Kosher presents a collection of first steps from Jason Zumpano.

The Greatest,Cat Power,by: Amy Phillips,Managing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e7c0084474cd0bfcab/1:1/w_160/1071f645.jpg,2006-01-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1346-the-greatest/,Matador,"The dirty little secret about Chan Marshall is that she may actually have her shit together. As a recent Harp magazine interview pointed out (in between Marshall's musings on interest rates, real estate, and finances), she's spent the past decade building a successful career without even employing a manager. It's a feat that few, if any, of her contemporaries have been able to pull off-- and given that, at this very moment, a significant portion of the indie music world is salivating for tomorrow's release of the seventh Cat Power record, it would seem she's pulled it off quite well. Of course, the Cat Power allure has always been tied up in Marshall's notoriously seasick live performances. In 2001, the woman who jumped into the audience mid-performance and shoved me aside while tearfully fleeing the Irving Plaza stage certainly didn't seem capable of balancing a checkbook, let alone single-handedly negotiating a more generous contract with her record label (as the Harp article alleges). But then, the public-vs.-private tightrope-walk is as old as marketing itself: Johnny Cash never shot a man in Reno, either. Still, it's impossible to ignore the pull of the Beautifully Tortured stereotype, no matter what reality lies behind it. But if we didn't want Beautifully Tortured, we'd be obsessing over Norah Jones. That brings us to The Greatest. Not to knock Norah, but she isn't tortured-- and neither is this album, which, if Nic Harcourt or VH1 get their hands on it, could be battling ""Don't Know Why"" for airplay supremacy on Mom's car stereo in the coming months. Like all Cat Power records, The Greatest is a mostly sad, heartbroken, hopeless, rainy-day affair; it just isn't damaged. For that reason, it's also going to gain her a lot of new fans. The Greatest was recorded in Memphis, with several of that city's veteran studio musicians serving as her backing band, including Mabon ""Teenie"" Hodges on guitar, his brother Leroy ""Flick"" Hodges on bass, and Steve Potts on drums. These soul legends have played with Al Green, Booker T. and the MG's, Aretha Franklin, Neil Young, and more; in other words, they don't seem like the kind of dudes who'd stand much tortured diva bullshit from some no-name white girl off Matador Records. These are first-rate professionals, and their contributions-- a far cry from those of Steve Shelley and Dirty Three, or even Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl-- add as much to the album as they detract. The title song opens the album with the same halting, thick-fingered piano style Marshall has relied on since 2000's The Covers Record, but here it's swathed in Henry Mancini strings, teary delay effects, gently nudging drums, and Marshall's own multi-tracked voice echoing her lead vocals like Mary and Flo on the Supremes' loveliest ballads. ""The Greatest"", with its evocative lyrics of nostalgia and regret is, like ""Colors and the Kids"" and ""Good Woman"" before it, bleakness at its most pristine. But Marshall doesn't wallow long, following the track with ""Living Proof"", Cat Power's most conventionally sexy song yet. As it swaggers on lazy horns and careening ""Like a Rolling Stone"" organ, you can almost picture Marshall in a pair of tight jeans, swinging her hips in front of a jukebox. ""Lived in Bars"" retains that Southern-fried sensuality in its back half: After beginning as a late-night smoky bar lament, the song lifts off on shoo-ba-doo harmonies and a bouncy beat; all of a sudden, it's getting hot and heavy in a pickup truck. The marriage of Marshall's offbeat musical sensibility to her new backing band's in-the-pocket playing bears its most successful fruit on those three songs. At heart, they're smooth, accessible lite-R&B; tracks-- as close to Chan in Memphis as the album gets. Still, if that's what adult-alternative sounds like in 2006, sign me up for the AARP. But the middle chunk of The Greatest just feels old. It's beyond ""adult"": These songs seem musty and outdated, like stuff my grandparents might have danced to during The War. ""Could We"", ""Empty Shell"", ""Islands"", and ""After It All"" are all finger snaps and jazz hands, Marshall twirling her umbrella in the park as Fred Astaire woos her with clicked heels and a top hat. ""Thank you/ It was great/ Let's make/ Another date/ Real soon/ In the afternoon,"" Marshall purrs over call-and-response horns and hotel bar piano. ""After It All"" even features whistling and the kind of cabaret melody Nellie McKay drops into a song right before she threatens to kill you. Worse is ""Where Is My Love"", the album's rock-bottom low. Marshall moans the title ad infinitum (interspersed with ""bring him to me"" and stuff about horses galloping and running free) in some sort of high school musical approximation of Nina Simone. She's accompanied only by Cheez Whiz piano scales and those same heart-tugging strings from ""The Greatest"", only this time they sound creepily manipulative, not heartbreaking or beautiful. I envision Marshall in a fluffy white gown with a plunging neckline singing this song out of a balcony window. At the end, a dove lands on her outstretched finger. This is not what I want from Cat Power. It's not what I want from anybody, not even Norah Jones. The Greatest regains its composure as it nears the finish line, ending with a pair of songs that wouldn't have seemed out of place on any Cat Power album since What Would the Community Think. ""Hate"", the only track that might scare off newcomers while delighting her original fanbase, is Marshall alone with her guitar, playing stark, cutting riffs, and murmuring ""I hate myself and I want to die."" ""Love and Communication"" is the album's first three tracks as viewed through a fun-house mirror: Instead of the Memphis crew welcoming Marshall into their world, the closing track sees Marshall luring the studio vets down her dark, claustrophobic alley. The strings, horns, and organs press forward in deliberate staccato stabs, advancing on the ear as if programmed by Dr. Dre. The biggest challenge of this album isn't going to be commercial success; just stick ""Could We"" on the soundtrack to a hip romantic comedy, and it'll take off on its own. The difficult part will be proving to longtime fans that Chan Marshall is the one in control here. She's made an album that, for the most part, is polished and accessible. For better or worse, she's stretched her musical horizons far beyond the close-knit indie rock world-- a world that likely doesn't want her to change.",,7.9,
Space Shift,Steve Spacek,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cbea9e61561daa543e/1:1/w_160/c2b3bdab.jpg,2006-01-19 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7841-space-shift/,Sound in Color,"There are two reasons why Steve Spacek's new album seems tailor-made for the Barnes & Noble listening stations nationwide. The first is purely aesthetic: Space Shift's balance between affable experimentation and familiarity-- it's essentially soul music, although the cut-upness of it wants to be described as neo-- is perfect for listeners who like their music edgy yet polite. The other is slightly more diabolical, if unintentionally so. Because the thing about listening stations is that no one wants to stand there for very long, ears stewing in imagined bacteria. So it's easy to imagine an impatient listening stationer making it halfway through the first proper track on Space Shift, ""Dollar"", being floored by its off-kilter lusciousness (which will turn out to be largely uncharacteristic of the album), and copping it on the assumption that the rest of the album will be just as striking. No such luck: ""Dollar"", it turns out, is something of an anomaly. It seems as if its success can be chalked up less to inspired songwriting on Spacek's part than to the eerie majesty of J Dilla's production, who, turned loose on the whole album, might have transformed Spacek's standard arrangements into something visionary. On ""Dollar"", the drums vividly splash through the track's dark water; Spacek's chopped and filtered voice flits about elusively; one long, sampled syllable drones continuously in the background like a horizon for the jumbled tableau. Unfortunately, Space Shift never attains such sublimity again, though it brushes it from time to time. ""Thursday"", with its busy squelch and minutely ornate percussion, comes close, although it lacks most of the gusty negative space that makes ""Dollar"" so intense. ""The Hills"" opens promisingly with lush, liquid glissandos, but soon lets out into a pleasantly bouncy (if innocuous) soul track. Spacek's voice is mellifluous, but not distinctive enough to stir much emotion, which really stands out without J Dilla around to rearrange the aural field into something more captivating. The austere funk of ""Reversible Top"" doesn't do much for Spacek's glassy falsetto, nor does the rigid clap of ""Smoke"" flatteringly complement his natural register. So an album that shows signs of striving to be the r&b; Prefuse 73 pulls back from this ambition time and again, plays it safe, and makes at least a few people wish they'd spent a little more time with those sweaty headphones.","Former Spacek head offers his solo debut, highlighted by a J Dilla-produced single.

As Is Now,Paul Weller,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9fc9d034d5c69bf3d60/1:1/w_160/283e3fc7.jpg,2006-01-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8625-as-is-now/,Yep Roc,"As the elder statesperson for Britain's trad-rock community, Paul Weller doesn't have a whole lot left to prove. His place in the rock canon was already sealed by his music with the Jam, his work with the Style Council was laudably adventurous-- even if their last couple of records were total disasters-- and he recovered from the debacle of that band's demise nicely in the early 90s by getting back to basics, turning to his love of old r&b; and Small Faces guitar pop for inspiration. As Is Now is Weller's eighth studio solo album, and it does very little that you could call unexpected, but does it all very well nonetheless. Following the inconsequential covers album Studio 150, it's a welcome return to form, harking back to the straight-ahead rock'n'roll of 1997's Heavy Soul with shades of the mellow craft that dominated 2002's Illumination. Weller's husky voice still handles the charging rockers nicely, but it's the more subtle ballads like the searching, Mellotron-soaked ""Pan"" where he really shines and gets to use his range to its fullest effect. ""I Wanna Make It Alright"" is one of several songs that hint at Weller's love of jazz, loping along with a swinging gait as pianos whiz about in the background and he sings in a falsetto. ""Roll Along Summer"" goes even further in that direction, centering on a fluttering alto sax solo and loose-limbed drumming that smoothly underpins Weller's swooping vocals. The alto sax makes a grittier appearance on the the seven-minute groover ""Bring Back the Funk"", a track that suffers from lyrics as ill-considered as the title. By the 20th time Weller sings ""We gotta bring back the funk, ya'll/ We gotta bring back the love ya'll,"" you'll wish it was an instrumental. Still, it beats his perplexing order to ""sing you little fuckers/ Sing like you got no choice"" on the brittle trad-rock of ""Come On/Let's Go"". So it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but even when the lyrics are tolerable at best it's tough to argue with lean rockers like ""Blink and You'll Miss it"" and ""From the Floorboards Up"", both of which showcase monster choruses and plenty of winding, heavily distorted lead guitar. What really struck me as I listened to As Is Now, though, is how much it grew on me. Where on the first listen I found it merely okay, it's a record that reveals itself as a work of surprising depth and detail when you give it multiple spins and start noticing things like the clever trombone counterpoint in the verses of ""Here's the Good News"". For a guy with nothing left to prove, Weller sounds determined not to fade away, and as long as he keeps making records like this every couple of years, there's no danger of that happening.","Yep Roc issues the latest from the former Jam leader and current elder statesman for Britain's trad-rock community.

Straight to the Pros: Dragged-N-Chopped,Chrome,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74fb1335d7bf1699016/1:1/w_160/b7244dd7.jpg,2006-01-19 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1827-straight-to-the-pros-dragged-n-chopped/,Hypnotize Minds,"It seems like half the rappers in Memphis have been affiliated with Three-6 Mafia over the course of the group's 15-year history. But even singular voices like the sneeringly sassy Gangsta Boo and the goofily adenoidal Lil Wyte have been overshadowed by the trademark murky bounce of Three-6 house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J, who've pioneered a darkly simplistic form of Southern rap built on eerie minor-key synth melodies and huge, cavernous drums. On their last two projects (Frayser Boy's Me Being Me and the Three-6 group album Most Known Unknowns), the producers experimented with lush soul samples and sweeping strings, yielding their biggest-ever hit, ""Stay Fly"". So the most striking thing about Straight to the Pros, the debut album from Paul and Juicy's new protégé Chrome, isn't the emcee himself; it's Paul and Juicy's decision to mostly abandon their successful new direction for the impenetrably hard horror-crunk on which they built their name. Straight to the Pros is the purest example of the Mafia's signature sound-- a fog of ghostly chimes and ominous synth-bass foghorns-- since their 2003 album Da Unbreakables, but if it sounds like a bit of a rehash at times, the approach also results in a handful of pieces that rank among their best production work yet. On ""16 oz."", a churning wave of bass stunningly drops out to make room for an old-school 808 and an evil little xylophone riff, while ""Gutta Man"" interpolates the theme of the old ""Spider-Man"" cartoon to add an ecstatically bizarre edge to an otherwise run-of-the-mill rob-and-kill track. As for Chrome, well, he's fine. He's got a high-pitched, nasal voice-- sort of like Eazy-E-- that makes a great foil to Paul and Juicy's riotous swamp-bass excursions. During the screwed-up chorus of ""What Cha Need"", he offers a percussive double-timed counterpoint to a series of disembodied voices, whereas on ""Get They Ass Kicked"", he's all heated snarl, refusing to be outshined by guests Lil Scrappy and Lil Wyte. Still, he never says anything unusual or revelatory, sticking instead to the typical Three-6 tropes of dealing drugs and beating folks up. So the album's most unexpected moment comes from Juicy J: On the now-traditional album-closing posse cut, surrounded by dudes talking themselves up, he dedicates his entire voice to Hurricane Katrina: ""Now they wanna call us refugees?/ What the fuck you mean?/ 'Cuz a nigga ain't ate in three days and his clothes ain't clean."" It's a curious glimpse of what could happen if Three-6 Mafia abandoned its violently myopic worldview and used their dark powers for good.","Debut album from the protégé of Three-6 Mafia house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J.

All Tomorrow's Parties 3.1,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75eb1335d7bf169903a/1:1/w_160/3a71099d.jpg,2006-01-19 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1844-all-tomorrows-parties-31/,ATP,"You may remember Matt Groening as the creator of comic strip ""Life In Hell"" and a frequent contributor to the FOX network's ""The Tracy Ullman Show"". What may surprise you is that prior to those short-lived efforts and a moderately funny TV series called ""Futurama"", Groening was responsible for some caustic L.A. Reader rockcrit. Sample snark: ""The bigger the locale the band is named after, the more lame the band will be."" See, I always forget it wasn't Asia who did ""The Final Countdown"". Leaving overseas imbroglios aside, the stateside arm of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival tapped Groening to select the lineup for its 2003 event. (Other curators have included Slint, Modest Mouse, Pavement, Mogwai, Tortoise, Shellac, Autechre, and Sonic Youth.) As evidenced on this belated compilation, Groening's choices, far from suitable for Grand Funk-worshiping fatties and metal-headed busdrivers, instead exhibit the cranky connoisseurship of a comic book guy-- or a Pitchfork reviewer. All Tomorrow's Parties 3.1 washes away indie guilt like a revitalizing tonic-- the disc's 13 tracks present aspiring rock-and/or-roll geeks with a lineage of gloriously creative noise linking ATP's Velvet namesakes to the comp's libidinous proto-punk, contempo indie pop, and proudly sideshow avant-garde. Much of this rock snob's anthology is appropriately devoted to the dissonant, if not always the arcane. Sonic Youth's opening ""Simpsons Theme"", a 46-second instrumental as familiar as a chalkboard maxim, is both, having previously appeared on the 1996 compilation Go Simpsonic With the Simpsons. It's not quite as fun as Yo La Tengo's 1998 psychedelic version, but why split thinning hairs? At the opposite side of the disc, Jackie-O Motherfucker turns in a previously unreleased nine-and-a-half-minute freakout of ""Revolution 9"" muttering, R2D2 squiggles, and abstract guitars that make more sense than a ""Family Guy"" plot. Also in the collections of proper obsessives, like Roger Moore-signed Sean Connery photos and rare suicide editions of Mary Worth, the Stooges' ""Fun House"" remains a reckless, writhing classic, despite its generally ignored similarities to ""Break on Through"". The Magic Band bizarrizes ""You Really Got Me"" riffs on ""Dropout Boogie"", belching lyrical matter befitting a Dennis the Menace-like character. Daniel Johnston's love song ""Syrup of Tears"" resonates with simple, sincere devotion-- like lord help me a just-not-that-bright beer-guzzler for his beautiful wife-- that wholly redeems its ""Jump""-like synths. Deerhoof's ""Desaparecer""? Ay caramba. Then there's the strain of indie whose late-night thrashings have since accidentally birthed Newsweek articles on ""yupsters."" Elliott Smith, originally slated to play at 2003's ATP, is represented by his mordant, underrated ""Pictures of Me"", from 1997 high point Either/Or. With its casual, even jaunty description of ""dying just to get the disease,"" the song prompts the question of whether the folk-punk anti-hero would loathe the underground's O.C.-ization-- or perversely embrace it. Course the Shins appear, squeezing through twisting melodic chutes on the still-revelatory ""Young Pilgrims"". Modest Mouse waxes disjointedly misanthropic on ""Bukowski"", a weirder moment from 2004's still-Good News, and Spoon's gruff stranger-dance'n'yarr swordfight ""The Two Sides of Monsieur Valentine"" sounds even better apart from its excellent surroundings on last year's Gimme Fiction. By comparison, American Analog Set's whispery, emotional deathcab-wish and Electrelane's popular-music-befouled-bass-goes-gospel pale in their hot-diggity-damn good-enoughness.

Fonotone Records,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81a9d034d5c69bf3968/1:1/w_160/8c0081a3.gif,2006-01-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2041-fonotone-records/,Dust-to-Digital,"In a public proclamation to the city of Frederick, Maryland, A Wayfaring Stranger-- presumably the alias of Dust-to-Digital brainchild Lance Ledbetter-- describes Joe Bussard's Frederick-based Fonotone Records as ""the last of the 78 rpm record labels, which documented the final lingering barbaric yawps of old time music that was born and nurtured in the southern United States."" Today, creaking open Dust-to-Digital's new Fonotone Records cigar box, determined diggers will find five CDs (containing, collectively, 131 distinct tracks), a 160-page perfect-bound book, 17 full color postcards culled from Kodak slides, three record label reproductions, and a tiny, nickel plated pop-bottle opener. Ledbetter, responsible for 2003's staggering, cotton-stuffed Goodbye, Babylon box, understands how to set a perfect scene using only objects, photographs, and songs: Scatter the contents of the box on your coffee table, load a CD into your stereo, and watch your living room slowly transform into a dusty, jug-set southern porch. Eager buyers may be tempted to conflate Bussard's personal, world-renowned collection of nearly 25,000 78s (mostly hard country from the 1920s and 30s, including Jimmie Rodgers' entire discography and a few records unavailable anywhere else) with Fonotone, but most of the cuts included here are newer, dating from the early to mid-1960s (Bussard started the label in 1956, and ceased operations in 1970), and focused on old-time revivals and Bussard's own pet projects. Each of the five discs has a corresponding title-- Jug in the Shade, Flight of Fonotone, Some Summer Day, Wild Mountain Ramble, and Basement Blues-- and all were digitized from reel-to-reel master tapes, preserving the one-microphone, no-overdubs rawness of Bussard's vision (according to Dust-to-Digital's website, the tapes were stored in a cigar smoke-filled basement for 50 years), without sacrificing clarity of sound or message. Fonotone began in Bussard's parents' home (Bussard was only 20 when the label opened), after he recruited and recorded some pickers from his local National Guard; before long, Fonotone grew to include now-legendary contributions from fellow collector and guitar visionary John Fahey (credited here as Blind Thomas, a smirking moniker familiar to those already acquainted with Fahey's long run as pseudo-bluesman Blind Joe Death). Fahey and Bussard were notorious for their crankiness and shared distaste for contemporary trends; in a 2001 interview with Washington City Paper, Fahey blamed the homogenization of the post-1955 south on ""goddamned government workers moved in from strange, horrible Northern places like Ohio and Minnesota,"" and in the Fonotone box's liner notes, Bussard glibly declares, ""I don't like commercial music today at all. It all sounds the same, like that pop stuff. In early years, every jazz and dance band was different. There wasn't one that sounded like another. Today, if you've heard one, you've heard them all."" Fahey's Fonotone 78s include some of the only vocals he ever laid down-- a version of Booker White's ""'Po Boy"", first recorded by White in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 1939, features Fahey's thin, scratchy growls over painfully spectacular blues guitar. Even though Fahey was a white, 20-year-old American University philosophy student when the song was recorded in 1959, his generic laments (""Ain't got no where to lay my weary head"") are still weirdly affecting-- and while Fahey's howls may stir up some dicey arguments about race, ""authenticity,"" and appropriation (in his mail order catalogue, Bussard credited Blind Thomas' songs as ""authentic negro folk music""), Fahey's mind-blowing technique (he played the blues with all five fingers) and heart-piercing guitar are still completely undeniable. As Bussard tells it: ""I said 'Why don't you sing like an old black guy and sing rough as hell and we'll call you Blind Thomas?' We did that as a joke, really."" Plenty of Fonotone contributors were encouraged to operate under regional names (chances are Bussard made most up on-the-spot), and the post-adolescent, backwoods humor of titles like the Tennessee Mess Arounders, Gabriel's Holy Testifiers, the Mash Mountain Boys, and the Bald Knob Chicken Snatchers is hardly lost here. Most of Fonotone's steady players were friends of Bussard or people who had stopped by to check out his records; Bussard himself appears frequently, most often as the jug player in Jolly Joe's Jug Band, and the casual, dudes-jamming-in-a-basement vibe is palpable throughout. Most tracks clock in at three minutes or under (Bussard admits: ""we watch the clock while we play, and when three minutes are up we nudge each other and finish up"") and feature freewheeling banjos, slide guitars, fiddles, harmonicas, mandolins, autoharps, washboards, and the occasional bass. Whether you're seeking sharp bluegrass throwdowns, jug jubilees, or more traditional vocal hillbilly (see anything by the Adcock Family or the Whitacre Family, especially), Bussard always seems to have the appropriate 78 on deck. In May 2005, Columbia/Legacy released ""You Ain't Talkin' to Me: Charlie Poole and the Roots of Country Music,"" another cigar box featuring contributions from Bussard, designed to illuminate the deep, rural origins of modern country music. While much of the Fonotone Box is actually a generation removed from country music's beginnings (if you're more interested in hearing Bussard's influences rather than his imitations, the Poole box or the Bear Family's astounding 12xCD Carter Family retrospective would be better places to start), Bussard's uncompromising reverence for the traditions and sounds introduced in the 1920s and 30s is still both impressive and edifying. And, most importantly: unbelievably fun.","Third release from the incomparable Atlanta label Dust-to-Digital compiles 131 tracks from Joe Bussard's Fonotone Records, ""the last of the 78 rpm record labels,"" over five discs, and adds a 160-page book, 17 color postcards, three record label reproductions, and a nickel-plated pop-bottle opener.

The Men Album is a 20-track 2xCD that gathers artists from across the musical landscape to perform alongside Jarboe's haunting, ethereal vocals. Yet while contributions from Low's Alan Sparhawk, Neurosis' Steve Von Till, and industrial and goth legends such as Chris Connelly, David J, and Blixa Bargeld offer exciting moments, too many indistinguishable songs combined with the sheer size of the collection smother its handful of strong numbers. These songs were recorded over the course of several years, which may have made the editing process more difficult, which is frustrating since sprinkled throughout the two discs are a handful of seemingly pointless tracks. ""Into Feral"" and ""Feral Blixa"", for example, consist almost entirely of bestial squeals and screeches from Blixa Bargeld. Further on we get ""Jarboe Feral (Durga)"", which layers a capella moans from Jarboe herself. Her voice is intriguing, sure, but this sounds like someone accidently leaned on the record button while she was warming up. Elsewhere we get a track that relies on an answering machine message, and another that's nothing more than a detailed description of food. The album's primary problem, however, is that too many of these songs lack anything to distinguish them from one another. Aside from the bits of randomness described above, almost all of them can be described with three blanket descriptions: slow, dark ballads, guitar driven goth rock songs, or dance mixes. Within those descriptions, however, there's little deviation from the formula. Jarboe even manages to take an 80s power ballad, ""Reason to Live"" from Kiss's 1987 album Crazy Nights, and turn it into a bland, generic goth tune. Having said all of that there are definitely a handful of strong, interesting songs here. In ""Found"", Jarboe's crooning pans from speaker to speaker while monk-like chanting vocals from Alan Sparhawk fill out the background. The combination of her lilting, elegant voice and his steady drone works perfectly. Contributions from members of Neurosis, A Perfect Circle, and Faith & the Muse turn ""Feral"" into a trudging, gloomy combination of industrial and metal. Toward the end of the second disc are a handful of standout tracks, including ""Angel Jim"", which features Jim Thirwell, and ""Subtraction"", where Chris Connelly's warbling vocals are the perfect counterbalance to Jarboe's. However, four or five successes in a score of songs just isn't enough, meaning The Men Album is for die-hards only.","Former Swans leader drafts Low's Alan Sparhawk, Chris Connelly, Blixa Bargeld, and others to assist with this 20-track, 2xCD release.

The Outer Void Intrepid Sailor,The Universe,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90613d19756521397c5/1:1/w_160/4f1550bb.gif,2006-01-18 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8387-the-outer-void-intrepid-sailor/,Microindie,"Inhale, Architecture in Helsinki fans. As the Universe, the fun-headed Australian hyperprog collective's Gus Franklin puts down the pixie sticks, whistles, and fuzzy math from last year's whirlwind-doing In Case We Die, joins brother Lachlan Franklin and Benjamin Browning, and picks up the gravity bong for a layered, languid space-pop odyssey. Fellow AiH member Isobel Knowles aids in the boldly-going. The Outer Void Intrepid Sailor might not sync with The Wizard of Oz, but you never know until you try. The story: An average dude with wispy Elliott Smith vocals gets drafted to fly ""to the ends of the known universe."" The outer-space imagery is pretty tough to ignore, but as with sci-fi starkids Grandaddy or Flaming Lips a couple of years ago, the pert pop melodies and playful spirit of adventure make the oddities easier to indulge. Speaking of, ""Goodbye"" does this best, lyrically recalling, yes, that Bowie song over expansively reverbed acoustic guitars. The faster, fizzier power-pop of ""The Radio Is Dead"" shakes off the robot blues and could be early Sloan (albeit produced by the Microphones) until its portentous final footfalls. Still, the subject matter provides a handy excuse for warm, chirping synths and intricately textured sonics. ""There's no pianos in space/ So I can't even practice my scales,"" delicate ballad ""No Pianos"" laments. Space soon becomes a handy symbol for pop's perennial themes. Despite the protagonist's protestations on ""A-OK Up Here""-- initially a cappella except for the ambient noise of the vessel-- loneliness weighs heavy on our intergalactic wayfarer. Urgent sirens and clattering programmed percussion chase him through Bladerunner's bleak urban future, but all he needs fits into the three words of ""You Need Love"", which wafts through the atmosphere like the dreamier bits of Air's Moon Safari. No one can hear you scream, sure, but on albums like this every heartbeat still clamors vainly against the vacuum. If The Outer Void Intrepid Sailor is indebted to voyages past, it's also well aware of it. While setting up the plot, ""The Announcement"" name-checks ""Ticket to Ride"" and the apropos ""Nowhere Man"". ""Goodbye"" casually cites Douglas Adams' numerical answer to everything. The Universe dare to celebrate their universe through skewed, ELO-intricate pop even as their hero's discovery is ultimately disturbing: ""There Is Nothing Out There"", the slow-motion finale reveals, before vanishing in an angelic, all-encompassing hum, like infinity exhaling.","Microindie-released space-pop odyssey from a band led by Architecture in Helsinki's Gus Franklin.

"American Primitive, Vol. II: Pre-War Revenants (1897-1939)",Various Artists,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86113d1975652139632/1:1/w_160/78832488.gif,2006-01-18 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2110-american-primitive-vol-ii-pre-war-revenants-1897-1939/,Revenant,"American Primitive Vol. II: Pre-War Revenants (1897-1939) could seem curative, or worse. The imagined correctives queue up: folk music's history is white racist, the Guthrie to Dylan to O Brother revival, Fahey and Takoma ripped their trad folk figure from toothless country mouths, freak-folk strives for an inauthentic or inaccurate primitivism. The telling question can be asked in the mirror: Who's the asshole, really? These wars have already been fought or fabricated: not listening, it turns out, is the only thing in line for a cure. One problem is scale; another's the otherwise brilliantly researched liner notes by Dean Blackwood and Edward Komara: words along the lines of ""the ineffable sought by every wannabe ramshackle outfit this side of a Williamsburg loft is here in spades,"" conjure melodrama, and strawmen as well-- shame on us all, right? But American Primitive Vol. II covers two discs, and its 50 songs are united only by the fact that these songs are so obscure even maniacal folk compilers like Harry Smith or Alan Lomax (one exception: 78 collector and Fonotone founder Joe Bussard) missed them the first time through. The relic quality comes through in the static crackles and transfer hiss that blanket songs cut into literal wax, stamped on shellac, neglected for years, and finally brought to CD: There is, ultimately, a lot of noise to cut through before the ghosts and the haunted end up in the same room. Released on John Fahey's Revenant label (his final work as a curator), it's easy to see how fully this was his project: Bayless Rose, an artist with only four vinyl sides to show for his existence, is as post- as he is pre-Fahey's ragged precision ramble. At the same time, the pathos that went subliminal in many of Fahey's later requia often finds an earlier vocalization in these tracks. Henry Spaulding, another guitar guy, puts it on ""Cairo Blues"" like this-- ""Women will treat you kind and sweet/ Kick and knife you, beat you and cut you, too."" Though the mournful stuff punches guts (Mattie May Thomas' ""Workhouse Blues"" begins: ""A made up song, just about being in prison, alone""), it's equally weird and complicated-- particularly in the figure of the Nugrape Twins. Of their two songs, one's a tired hymn (""Let the Jesus gently guide me""), the other a hymnal ad for ""Ice Cold Nugrape"", a pop jingle 80 years old. Don't get too certain yet; not with kazoo-led free hick-jazz combo the Salty Dog Four playing spoiler. American Primitive breathes today though because of its New Year's resolution music, a bottomless and vengeful recounting of bloody mistakes and never-agains. Two deep-reaching hollerers run this game: The unfathomably sad Elvie Thomas and the incredibly violent Geeshie Wiley. While Elvie's ""Motherless Child Blues"" obsesses on the past like ""My mother told me just before she died/ O daughter daughter please don't be like me/ To fall in love with every man you see,"" Geeshie's in the middle of making her mistakes: ""I'm gonna cut your throat baby, I'll look down in your face/ Gonna let some lonesome graveyard be your resting place."" American Primitive's best songs are simply dangerous, in matters of faith (Homer Quincy Smith's ""I Want Jesus to Walk With Me"") and fucking around (Wiley and Thomas: ""Ashes to ashes, sand to sand/ Every married woman got a backdoor man""); murder, too.

Weeville / Fork Songs,Tall Dwarfs,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b4ea9e61561daa58ae/1:1/w_160/c6acb629.jpg,2006-01-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11857-weeville-fork-songs/,Homestead,"When we spotlight reissues like these, it's usually for one of two reasons: Either the music is historical (seminal, groundbreaking, definitive, influential), or it's the exact opposite-- unique enough to stand outside time, feeling just as distinct and fascinating today as it did when first released. New Zealand's Tall Dwarfs are in the interesting position of fitting both categories. They're a little like Syd Barrett, Half Japanese, or early Ween-- pioneers in the history of being odd, all hermetically sealed from everything else around. Factor in their more challenging idiosyncracies, and their small, devoted following starts to make sense-- it's a surprisingly diverse cult, but it skews heavily toward unreconstructed record geeks. Welcome to the original world of indie, where the niche appeal is the important part: If it seems like these guys are vastly overrated, that's probably because their rabid fans tend to be the only ones talking about them, or hearing them at all. It's entirely possible that you have better things to do than make grand efforts to join their ranks. If there's anything this particular duo gets ""historical"" credit for, in fact, it's an early launch to the ultra-indie ""lo-fi"" aesthetic: Their mid-1980s records, made right at home, came cloaked in duct tape and dust, dim buzz and rough performance, mostly just two guys and their guitars and whatever backdrops of fake percussion they could cobble together behind it all. The sound of lo-fi was never the point, though; it's not like anyone ""invented"" tape hiss. By the time the Dwarfs-- Chris Knox and Alec Bathgate-- hit these two albums, their recording had cleared up into intelligibility, leaving behind the pure lo-fi ethos: all the raw personality, rough charm, and weird personal quirk of music rigged together in solitude, somewhere over by the closet. Add the Dwarfs' tendency toward psychedelic sound, and you can probably guess why these reissues are brought to you in part by members of Olivia Tremor Control. The ethos fits the songwriting; their sharp, energetic pop is all the better for its lack of embellishment, and their homespun psychedelia is all the stranger and more intimate. The former can come off like what you might dig out of Robyn Hitchcock's attic if he'd never had a record deal, and sometimes it's the duo's main selling point; songs like ""Mr. Broccoli"" come off like handwritten letters next to junk mail, and leave plenty of limelight to spare for the cutting, consistently involving lyrics. The latter aspect, though, might be the main hook for these reissues. These days there's plenty of interest in those woodshed psychedelics, and while the Dwarfs' version of it is anything but spaced-out or transcendent, it packs plenty of the same claustrophobic strangeness-- and plenty of the same bad-idea experiments-- that run from Jad Fair to modern-day Brooklyn. It's on 1990's Weeville that you get a better shot at that side of things: ""Breath"", for instance, is raw, spooked psych-rock, joyously harmonized over two guitars and one drum ticking time. ""Crawl"", another standout, treads all the way over into Syd Barrett's The Madcap Laughs territory. The songs around them bring in creaky keyboards and piano and devolve in any number of unexpected directions; the whole thing is covered in dirt and odd ideas, and it's a curious enough artifact to reward honest efforts to get inside its off-center aesthetic. 1992's Fork Songs, re-packaged with 1988's Dogma EP, requires less work: Its payoff isn't as high, but its songs are more relaxed, its sound-palette warmer, and its structures more intuitive. There's folk waltz on ""Wings"", country swing on ""Lowlands"", classic pop-rock on ""Life Is Strange"", and tender balladry on ""Think Small""-- as far as skewed aesthetics go, this can serve as the toe-dipping kiddie pool to Weeville's shallow end. Here's the caveat: Most of you reading this will not like the Tall Dwarfs, even on these, some of the most accessible of their releases. To most of you reading this, these songs won't even sound challenging or interesting-- they'll just sound like a couple of freaks banging out rickety crap at a rate of an album a weekend. It's not an unfair position. These songs are packed with fascinating hooks, fine lyrics, and alternating runs of bitter political sneering, emotional vulnerability, and everyday humor-- but there's something in their makeup that keeps it hard to access, a life-changing treat for the cult and a scrappy oddity to everyone else. Given the odds, these records might not really be worth the shot-- especially when stacked up against alternatives ranging from Knox and Bathgate's solo albums to the entire scrappy run of the Flying Nun label. Tread carefully, and don't worry: Your life will be no less complete for not ""getting"" this band.","Reissues of two of the lo-fi New Zealand band's LPs, one of which is boosted by the addition of the Dogma EP.

I Turn My Camera On EP / Sister Jack EP,Spoon,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51eb1335d7bf1698b10/1:1/w_160/6653d199.jpg,2006-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11833-i-turn-my-camera-on-ep-sister-jack-ep/,Matador,"You folks who paid import prices for the ""I Turn My Camera On"" CD single realize you got taken, right? If you were any sort of real Spoon fan-- meaning the sort that would spend $9 to purchase two songs-- you'd have pre-ordered Gimme Fiction back in May for its four-song bonus disc. And you'd have realized that the two B-sides from ""Camera"" were on that bonus disc, thereby making the purchase of said CD single redundant. Then you could've gone in on that Meat Lovers pizza with your roomie last week instead of hitting up the Taco Bell value menu for some super-sized bean burrito love for the third time this week. Even if you missed the bonus disc, the two songs ""Camera"" re-releases aren't worth sweating. The actual bonus gems were the two demos, which were available to download on the band's official website months in advance of Fiction's release, and don't feature here. In their place, we're treated to one quote-unquote remix, and the outtake ""Carryout Kids"", which provides ample evidence that the best stuff from the Fiction sessions made it on the album. ""Carryout Kids"" doesn't sound like any particular Spoon song, but still manages to sound like something the group's done before, and done better. Once again, Britt Daniel plays the piano man, pumping away for tips but with enough down-time to have a ""Glass Onion"" moment. After a while, some guitar enters the picture, followed by some xylophone, while Britt keeps chugging along. And then there's a vocal sample of some sort at the end, and there you go. That leads into ""You Was It"", an obnoxious amped-up version of album track ""Was It You?"" In case you want to have a old-person moment of the ""turn that noise down!"" variety 20 years before it's scheduled, just put this track on repeat. Those of you that really want to live that close to the edge-- so it sounds like you're at a shitty Lightning Bolt show sexing a bass amp-- can go with God. (Just don't forget the earplugs.) The one saving grace of this effort: It's about minute shorter than the album version. The ""Sister Jack"" single, on the other hand, does right by the consumer. That is, if the consumer's looking to see how John McEntire can turn the aforementioned ""Camera"" into a Peter Gabriel song á la ""Sledgehammer"" or ""Big Time"". It's funny, but it's true-- emphasize the disco elements, insert more Britt oohs and ahhs, add some steel-mill sparks and echoechoecho, and suddenly everything goes Claymation. Nevermind the other track on this disc-- ""Sunday Morning Wednesday Night"" has a pretty bridge, but Britt's double-tracked mushmouthing earns the effort a begrudging sideways thumb. Thankfully, the six minutes of lead-footed boom-bap on the remix more than makes up for the other track's shortcomings. I dare say that McEntire's ""Camera"" is an improvement on the official version, but I prefer my disco moves to be opulent and gaudy; mileage will undoubtedly vary. Regardless, if there's any track from Fiction that's worth owning twice, it's ""Sister Jack"", so if the need to purchase new Spoon product overwhelms any prudent impulses, buy American.",,3.4,
Rats! Sing! Sing!,GoGoGo Airheart,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf53ea9e61561daa7a42/1:1/w_160/3e8dfd6e.jpg,2006-01-17 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3493-rats-sing-sing/,GSL,"Gogogo Airheart have played for 13 years, but never to the same ecstatic reception as Futureheads or Franz Ferdinand. Once upon a time, those bands supported Airheart on tour; now the Sunderland and Glasgow acts are crossing over while the San Diego band quietly releases Record No. 6. Forgive the apples and pears, but Airheart, like Franz and Futureheads, make trendy, canon-mashing rock. So where's the viability? Great singles help, great albums clinch, but Gogogo Airheart never got past step one: applying the polish. On Rats! Sing! Sing!, the band nail a losing formula, blending familiar sounds-- bratty discopunk, brooding college rock, white boy dub-- without the usual giveaways. Four-on-the-floor foundations, for instance, are tapped out on big, untreated drums, not the tamped-down 70s cans purveyed by James Murphy or Kudu. Even the most rigid numbers are permitted a sly swing, whether by sloven (""So Good"") or double-drummed funk (""Double Bummer""). Trebly guitars don't ill-become any of these songs, but Airheart's are particularly crispy; for a truly face-singeing experience, see ""Lie With a Lamb"" or ""Shake It Off"", whose rollicking, sun-baked guitar solo would make fellow So-Cal'er Stephen Malkmus proud. It's actually rarer for bands to buck trend at this superficial end of the spectrum, especially when they make a conscious effort of it. Few begrudge pushing contrivance upon written material, but when it comes to aesthetics, the protocol is more restrictive. Rats! Sing! Sing!'s casual variety calls for a less specific stylization, but rather than hybridize Gogogo Airheart treat each song individually, which begets a number of interesting choices, some more successful than others. From piecemeal opener ""Rats"" the band extracts a Walkmen-ish scraggliness with sprinklings of wet piano and radio oscillations. Success! Walls of murky amplified sound vex ""Burn It Down""'s straightforward surf-rock. Cool! But ""Heart on a Chain"" is stripped down to the point of having a one-off feel; the song seems to want to shake its breezy torpor and make a charge but it's foiled by a fade out. Arbitrary? From here down the record's backstretch the band stop making curious decisions confidently and quit deciding altogether. Grooves dissipate, vocals flop around in echo, riffs take a rain check. Like Jason Blake on a wraparound, Gogogo Airheart just can't finish. Only no one's blocking their net; the problem seems one of commitment.","Veteran San Diego band blend bratty discopunk, brooding college rock, and dub.

Arizona Amp and Alternator,Arizona Amp and Alternator,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d7c0084474cd0bfee4/1:1/w_160/a80072d9.jpg,2006-01-17 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/496-arizona-amp-and-alternator/,Thrill Jockey,"""When something ain't broke around here, we don't fix it,"" Howe Gelb sings on ""AAAA (1)"", giving the unofficial slogan for the fictitious Arizona Amp and Alternator, his new, possibly one-off moniker and the concept behind this self-titled album. The prolific Gelb has been doing similar and similarly tossed-off records like this for years, both as a solo artist and with the band Giant Sand. This new project is more conceptual than his usual m.o. and occasionally the mechanic's garage motif seems intrusive, especially on the four ""AAAA"" songs, which may have something to do with being blue in a red state. Regardless, Arizona Amp and Alternator on the whole captures the pace of a hot afternoon spent lounging in the shade, spouting lawn-chair philosophy over arid desert folk and waiting for the next stranded driver with a stalled automobile. Gelb does get a few customers: Grandaddy backs him on three songs, M. Ward stops by briefly for a dusty sing-along, and Jeremy Gara of the Arcade Fire drums on one track. Several female singers drop by for duets, including previous collaborator Henriette Sennenvaldt, and Danish singer Marie Lorette Friis keeps a straight face playing European ingénue to Gelb's desert stalker during a jokey cover of Frank Loesser's ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". Scout Niblett makes a predictably weird spoken-word cameo on ""Recital"", but it's ace mechanic Marie Frank who steals the show. She subtly and beautifully tunes up Gelb's rough-edged vocals on ""Where the Wind Turns the Skin to Leather"" and ""Loretta and the Insect World"". That song, with its boy-girl back-and-forth, sounds like Lee Hazlewood on a heat-induced fever dream, especially when it hits the rococo girl-group chorus and Frank revels in an earthy lust born of broken love. But Gelb is still boss, and Arizona Amp and Alternator is a predictably shaggy-dog album. As usual he's never in any hurry, and often goes off on wild tangents that occasionally lead nowhere in particular. But that addled esoterica is part of Gelb's appeal: To get to moments like the atmospheric guitar outro to ""Where the Wind Turns the Skin to Leather"" and the chorus to ""Loretta and the Insect World""-- which catch you off guard with their simple, streamlined elegance-- you have to wade through discursive moments like the four ""AAAA"" tracks and the plodding cover of Traffic's ""Low Spark of High Heeled Boys"". For all its frustrations, this approach has suited Gelb well for more than two decades. As the man himself would say, if it ain't broke...","New record from the prolific Howe Gelb features contributions from M. Ward and members of Grandaddy and the Arcade Fire.

The Buddha Machine,FM3,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec55e6ef959693232cc/1:1/w_160/cb13de52.gif,2006-01-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3354-the-buddha-machine/,Staalplaat,"Instead of explaining the Buddha Machine, I wish I could just persuade you to drop the cash and order one, so you can figure it out on your own. Giving you my impressions will ruin the fun, in the same way that you don't give kids a review of a toy-- you just hand it over and let them start playing. When mine came in the mail, opening the box gave me a kind of Christmas morning rush and a flash of ""what is this thing?"" It's packaged in a small cardboard box printed with Chinese lettering around an image of a street scene. Inside you'll find what looks like a small transistor radio, plus two AA batteries (also Chinese). Switch it on, and a soft, ambient loop starts to crackle through the tiny, cheap speaker built into the device. You can adjust the volume dial, or switch between the nine short loops programmed into the Buddha Machine-- and then you set it down and leave it alone. I've left it playing hours at a time while I sit at my desk, and I could even picture installing these around my house, like low budget installation art. But I don't want to get hung up on its artistry, because most important of all, it's also an object. The minute I opened the box, I wanted to hold it in my hand, and play with the switches, and carry it around with me. It has an output jack, but it's much more fun to listen to its cheap built-in speaker: at low volumes, the loops are placid, fitting into the corner of your ear, but turn up the dial or press it to your ear and you hear hundreds of nuances and crackles of static. And best of all, the music never stops. Sure, you can listen to a minimalist CD and imagine how it would feel to hear it for days on end, but the Buddha Machine lets you try it: There's no 80-minute limit, and the batteries will go for hours. Psychologically, it makes a big difference when you aren't waiting for the music to fade out. The nine loops are suggestive, but they're deliberately not engaging. A piece like Ekkehard Ehlers' ""Plays John Cassavetes 2"" makes you feel like you could hear it repeat forever, but in practice it needs to wrap itself up and end before we can get tired of it. The loops on the Buddha Machine don't shift or change over time, although you may be tricked into believing that they do, and a couple of loops that almost have hooks actually made me anxious, as I realized that I was waiting for them to move on. (The ninth loop, which is only two seconds long, is too fast and abrupt and probably could have been cut.) More than anything, the Buddha Machine is a great way to study ambient music. It's built to produce background music, but as you treat it more functionally, you might question whether it's ""art."" What's the point of music that doesn't move forward? Can something this boundless and utilitarian meet the same criteria as an album, like Brian Eno's Discreet Music, where the system was designed to run forever but strategically isn't allowed to? You don't have to think about these issues-- or about anything at all-- but you'd be missing out on part of the fun. Some people will call this a novelty, but it's not: It's a toy. Most of us are drawn to little gadgets that make music; we love to pick them up and fiddle with the switches, and play with them, and figure out how they work. Along the way we're testing and stretching the ways we experience and consume music. The Buddha Machine isn't the first self-contained music maker to sell as a work of electronic art, but it is an almost perfectly-realized example. And I can't stop playing with it.","What looks like a small transistor radio, complete with two AA batteries, turns out to be an ambient machine programmed with nine continuous loops.

New York Noise 2,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ea9d034d5c69bf38f8/1:1/w_160/ff56e98f.jpg,2006-01-17 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1996-new-york-noise-2/,Soul Jazz,"As recently as five years ago, the recorded legacy of the celebrated No Wave/post-punk scene of 1978-84 NYC was in a state of neglect, with many of its key documents either out of print or otherwise difficult to come by. More recently, however, there's been a veritable explosion of top-drawer material reissued from this crucial era, including the long overdue reissue of the seminal No New York compilation and expansive career overviews of scene mainstays like Mars, Rhys Chatham, DNA, and Arthur Russell. One of the most satisfying of these recent archival collections was Soul Jazz's 2003 compilation New York Noise 1978-1982, which gathered far-reaching tracks from such diverse acts as Liquid Liquid, Defunkt, and Glenn Branca. The inveterate historians at Soul Jazz have again dipped their fingers into the vaults on New York Noise 2, a collection that assembles tracks from better-known performers (Sonic Youth, Branca, Russell) alongside several from the decidedly more obscure likes of Clandestine, Red Transistor, and Certain General. As with the first volume, the songs here can pivot abruptly from elastic, throbbing disco into refracted Afrobeat, art-house dub, and the extremes of avant-garde dissonance. With a depth and breadth that suggests this particular reservoir is far from dry, the album coheres together remarkably well considering these tracks share little in common aside from their temporal and geographic origins. The collection opens with the infectious rhythms of ""Ungawa, Pt. 2"" by Pulsallama, a group founded by actress and future Bongwater member Ann Magnuson, which then proceeds effortlessly into Mofungo's dense, jazzy ""Hunter Gatherer"". These tracks immediately fix the album's ebullient motion, a dynamism that's further illustrated by Vortex OST's dizzy ""Black Box Disco"" and the unruly funk of Don King's ""Tanajura"". The vibrant momentum of these dance-flavored cuts is stilled only slightly by the occasional jarring segue into noisier, punk-centric tracks like Red Transistor's ""Not Bite"" or UT's pummeling ""Sham Shack"". Likewise, the monolithic guitar sculptures of Chatham's ""Drastic Classicism"" or Branca's ""My Relationship"" prove immovably dense enough to absorb whatever concussive waves might rock their exteriors. Also of note is the squiggling, unpinnable lurch of ""My Hands Are Yellow (From the Job That I Do)"" by the Del-Byzanteens, an act bolstered by the keyboards and vocals of filmmaker-to-be Jim Jarmusch. Unlike the first volume of New York Noise, which included Rammelzee and K.Rob's ""Beat Bop"", this compilation contains no true examples of early hip-hop, an exclusion that likely counts as the album's most glaring omission. And one could certainly question the inconsequential presence of Sonic Youth's ""I Dreamed I Dream"", an early, unformed piece that brings little to the table beyond name recognition. Quibbles about the track list aside, the most striking aspect this album is the artists' collective refusal to look backwards for inspiration. There's nothing on any of these tracks that could be mistaken for the work of a preceding decade. Instead, each performer here audibly strives to create music free from obvious precedent, a worthy objective that will hopefully provide sincere inspiration for those future acts tempted to look to the artists of New York Noise 2 for guidance.","Soul Jazz follows its 2003 collection of Big Apple late-70s/early-80s no wave and post-punk with a sequel featuring Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca, and Arthur Russell.

The Cellar Door Sessions 1970,Miles Davis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bf9d034d5c69bf3b04/1:1/w_160/7aec459e.jpg,2006-01-17 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2201-the-cellar-door-sessions-1970/,Columbia,"Firing like a machine gun over a heavily armored and equipped outfit of young, brawny assassins, Miles Davis ruled the world at the end of 1970. A year removed from his ""corruption"" at the hands of rock-- if you believe dozens of decaying jazz critics, that is-- Davis had the band and the vision to play music that no one would ever play again. His arsenal: ""Directions"", ""What I Saw"", ""Honky Tonk"", ""Inamorata"", ""It's About That Time""; with only Joe Zawinul's ""Directions"" having been played by any of Davis' groups before, the trumpeter had to know he was making a statement. In fact, none of the new stuff had more than a few notes, a couple of chord changes to distinguish it from ""formless jamming"" (to borrow another phrase from a critic), and if fans thought Bitches Brew was out there, what would they make of this? A few months removed from playing to 600,000 at the Isle of Wight, Davis had the nerve to hole up at The Cellar Door in Washington D.C., a small club holding no more than a couple hundred people. And he killed them. He and his band launched bomb after bomb for four nights; he slew every last person at the show, and listening to this noise now, it makes me want to kick the nonbelievers in the teeth. Fans will already know some of the music on the overwhelming 6xCD The Cellar Door Sessions 1970 because much of its final disc (from the band's last date at the club) was issued on 1971's Live-Evil. Of course, it was cut-up, rearranged, and interspersed with studio tracks, so even familiar performances sound new here. The box contains six of the 10 sets Davis' band played, remixed and sounding great (especially via an increased presence from Michael Henderson's bass), and extensive notes from everyone who played there-- except Davis. It's a shame we don't know what the band's leader thought of this stuff, because there is a case to be made that Henderson, drummer Jack DeJohnette, saxophonist Gary Bartz, keyboardist Keith Jarrett, and Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira comprised his last indisputably great band. When guitarist John McLaughlin shows up for the last set, things seems even more fiery, more volatile, and I always have to fight the urge to blast my neighbors into next week. In any case, I can only guess Davis was pleased-- in fact, he leaves most of the lengthy solo pace to his bandmates, content to let this stew brew and brew and brew. The first disc (from the band's first set on Wednesday night) begins right on Davis' solo from ""Directions"". DeJohnette is already playing like a motherfucker, nailing polyrhythms straight out of a drum'n'bass tune, and Davis flutters from behind a wah-wah pedal in turn. When he removes the effect, he plays high-pitched jabs-- a favorite move at the time-- and mixes in some furious runs, the kind he was gradually learning to leave behind as his music became more aggressive, more primal, LESS JAZZ. On the spacious ""Yesternow"" (originally from the Jack Johnson LP), the band stretches out. Nevertheless, Davis' solo is a strident mix of punches and runs, with Jarrett echoing him on the left after each phrase. Jarrett had already lit the fire under the track during his lengthy intro solo-- in fact, he was given a very long leash during these dates, frequently being allotted complete freedom to bring in tracks with unaccompanied performances. The band closes shop with the funked-out ""Inamorata"" and Davis' screaming melody. We're just getting started. The second disc, from the next night, begins with DeJohnette's deft pulse on ""What I Say"", Henderson hitting the downbeats like a rock. Jarrett again begins things with a flighty, short-breathed solo on electric piano before Davis comes in with the piercing ""melody"" (which is mostly more high-note jabs that I imagine took out the eyes of the first row of club patrons). Bartz takes off after a particularly agitated Davis solo, and the tune seems to jump into another gear altogether-- and the audience responds in kind with the first of many animated reactions to his solos. On ""Honky Tonk"", something of a gospel blues vamp, the band brings everything way down, as Henderson plays the main riff under Jarrett's shimmering piano asides. Davis' solo afterwards sounds almost suffocated by the dirge of a pulse, but given that remainder of the band's set featured blow-outs like ""It's About That Time"" (here, with an unbelievably funky coda) and ""Inamorata"", he may just have been venting his anticipation. Friday night's shows are spread over discs 3 and 4, the first of which contains epic versions of ""What I Say"", ""Directions"", and ""Honky Tonk"". I should note that the band never sounds out of breath in the slightest. Moreira's cuica squeak is all over the intro, as if chomping at the bit to let the floodgates open; Davis comes in about three minutes into the tune, nailing a wailing pitch into his solo and taking flight with a runs as if this was the first shot he'd ever gotten to play this stuff. Likewise, Jarrett's opening solo on ""Honky Tonk"" runs the gamut from blues, to modern jazz to an early run at the kind of exploratory impressionism he'd play on his own The Köln Concert years later-- these guys held a grand total of zero back. ""Inamorata"" from the fourth disc winds up for a minute before launching its main riff, as if the band were stretching its collective muscles and firing one last silo before disappearing into the night. Davis crawls out from between the twin locomotives of DeJohnnette and Henderson with a wah-wah'd solo, and it's obvious they probably could have gone on for hours. The Saturday night shows on discs 5 and 6, and the introduction of guitarist McLaughlin (whose late flight only allowed him to make the tail end of their gigs), brings home an abundantly clear point: This period was apex for Davis and his band. Reissue co-producer Adam Holzman makes the point that this music was a sort of end-game for Davis' Bitches Brew ideas, before leaping off into the funky underworlds of On the Corner and the hazy, quasi-psychedelic shows of his touring band from 1973-75. McLaughlin's jaw-dropping solo on ""Directions"" from the last disc serves notice to anyone who forgot that Davis really did want to play rock music, but with the intelligence and technique of jazz. It's tough to find very many examples on record of people playing with as much intensity or inspiration. Funny enough, some of the guys mention in the box's notes that they weren't quite sure what to expect with McLaughlin's arrival. I guess it only goes to show you can't stop genius in the making. In December 1970, you couldn't stop Miles Davis.","6xCD set contains six sets recorded at Washington D.C.'s tiny The Cellar Door, including material that was rearranged and issued on 1971's Live-Evil.

Omar Rodriguez,Omar Rodriguez-López,by: Cory D.

Recorded in Amsterdam last June, these songs are an extension of the Omar Rodriguez Quintet side project, and along for the ride are various musicians on horns, keys, and percussion, including several ATDI and Mars Volta cohorts. The results are extended, improv-style jams that mix wailing guitar solos, spasmodic drumming, and computer and tape effects with more traditional jazz elements. The two longest tracks here are ""Regenbogen stelen van prostituees"" and ""Jacob van Lennepkade"", which transition seamlessly to create a 27-minute opus and provide the real meat of the album. Adrian Terrazas-Gonzales' saxophone work stands out on ""Regenbogen"", but the back and forth between sax and wah-wah-pedaled guitar is what give the song its backbone. ""Jacob"" is slightly more subdued, using the shuffling drums and bouncing bass guitar to set the tone while Omar's guitar squeals atonally. Things change considerably for ""Vondelpark bij nacht"", a dark piece that never really takes off. Sitar, chimes, and computer blips swirl through the background while the sax takes the lead. The middle- eastern flair is a nice change of pace, but the lack of percussion or any discernable structure causes it to fade into the background quickly. The pace is picked up again with album closer ""Spoorkrijden op het fietspad"", the most rock oriented of the bunch, adding a small dose of funk and disco to the formula. Although this album was recorded during downtime on the Mars Volta's recent European tour, to dismiss it as a throwaway vanity project would be a mistake. Even though two of these tracks fall a little short of the mark, the length and power of the remaining three more than pick up the slack. While it's more jazz-oriented than the Mars Volta, Rodriguez uses the freedom of breaking away from his main gig here to create something that is just as unique and exciting.","Mars Volta star takes a rewarding solo turn that mixes guitar solos, spasmodic drumming, and computer and tape effects with traditional jazz elements.

Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b2c0084474cd0c0eac/1:1/w_160/117abc5b.gif,2006-01-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8309-cicada/,self-releasedself-released,"In late 2004, Birmingham, Ala.-based 13ghosts self-released their third full-length, Cicada, in an outsize, bulky package that was perhaps eye-catching in stores but a bane to anyone hoping to shelve it between 10,000 Maniacs and 50 Cent. Coming just over a year later, this new reissue on local label Skybucket is housed in a digipak and includes new artwork, but that original box remains a pretty good metaphor for the band's sound, which is similarly unwieldy. Cicada is chockablock with ideas, encompassing an impressive breadth of styles and sounds-- sharp Southern rock, drowsy gospel, laidback 1970s pop, buzzing indie lo-fi, Sparklehorse-style self-destructive folk, percolating lounge rhythms, threadbare Americana, a little country, a little blues, a few drum machines and some George Harrison-style guitarwork-- all jammed together in 21 tracks with unusual arrangements, jostling transitions, and abrupt endings that musically enact the lyrics' obsession with untimely death and departure. The core of 13ghosts, which takes its name from the William Castle horror flick (filmed in Illusion-O!), is duo Brad Armstrong and Buzz Russell, who trade off vocal and songwriting duties throughout the album and whose voices and influences often contrast dramatically. Russell's songs, including ""Trodden Way"" and ""The Trouble With Actual Organs"", pair strong pop melodies with spacey atmospherics, recalling bands like the Comas and Modest Mouse. Armstrong has a slightly wider range; in fact, I thought he was two different people at first. He alternates between a low-key, world-weary voice on tracks like ""Just Got Dead"" and ""Song from Down Here"" and a louder, brasher rasp on ""The Storm"" and ""Worldshaker"". His ""Robert J."" is the album's centerpiece; perhaps the most straightforward melody and arrangement on Cicada, it's a cautionary tale about a local singer scared of being swallowed up by his music, and it sounds like it could have been written by or about The Band. Armstrong doesn't romanticize or sentimentalize Robert J., but he and Russell clearly identify with him and certainly sympathize with his predicament, especially when 13ghosts' own music threatens to swallow them up. Cicada sounds larger than just two people. Thanks to a cast of supporting musicians-- including Azure Ray's Maria Taylor, who sings on ""Three Little Birds (After Bob Marley)""-- the music itself is always changing, swirling unsteadily around them, barely controlled. For example, the soft, spacy ""Toby Dammit Part One"" ends with a loud guitar outro that leads perfectly into ""Wormhead, My Dear"", which itself changes shape as it transitions into ""Ain't It Low"". It's not simply that anything could happen at any time on Cicada, but, more crucially, that everything seems to be happening all at once, as if the band felt life was too short or death too near to withhold any ideas or deny any possibilities. If Cicada sounds long, messy, and unfocused, it is-- but fascinatingly so. That scattershot aesthetic proves to be the album's life force, as the music derives its power from the crawlspaces between these sounds and styles. It makes for a strange, often unsettling listen, but one no less exciting for being so constantly disorienting. ","Originally self-released in 2004, this LP-- chockablock with ideas, encompassing an impressive breadth of styles and sounds-- is given a welcome reissue.

Congotronics 2: Buzz 'n' Rumble from the Urb'n' Jungle,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a860c0084474cd0c0dfc/1:1/w_160/92b6cec6.jpg,2006-01-16 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2109-congotronics-2-buzz-n-rumble-from-the-urbn-jungle/,Crammed Discs,"On the DVD that accompanies the second volume of Crammed Discs' Congotronics series, there's footage of a band called Tulu playing in a small market square, fronted by dancers and wearing sort of semi-traditional outfits and body paint. The band sits in a row of chairs, and the two men in the middle play instruments that could hardly be more makeshift: one is a rattle made from sardine cans and bedsprings, and the other is a piece of PVC piping taped to a resonating gourd and blown into like a didgeridoo. These contraptions exemplify the improvisatory resourcefulness of what turns out to be a small constellation of bands operating in the sprawling, tumble-down suburbs of Kinshasa, the teeming capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Congotronics 2 expands on the first volume of the series, which focused on the music of Konono No. 1, a band that helped to innovate Kinshasa's unique electro-traditional music. Counting Tulu, who only appear on the DVD, this compilation features seven Congolese bands recorded on the spot in Kinshasa by Crammed's Vincent Kenis, as well as a European performance by Konono, who in the last year have been embraced by a surprisingly wide Western audience ranging from worldbeat and rare groove aficionados to the avant-garde community. The musicians present have two things in common: They all have roots in rural Congo, and they are all playing traditional music, amplified to be heard over the urban din through, at best, unconventional means. While the sounds of these bands will certainly be familiar to fans of Konono, there is a remarkable amount of variety on the disc. Sobanza Mimanisa get the most from the least; their line-up consists of vocals, whistle, one guitar, an electric likembe and percussion consisting of a cowbell and an aerosol can being beaten against a plastic beer carton. The vocals crackle through the makeshift amplification, and the guitar and likembe can't help doing the same. Bolia We Ndenge's centerpiece is an antique accordion-- their segment on the DVD features a re-enactment of a force publique officer, complete with authentic vintage uniform, bestowing the accordion on a local village chief. Supposedly, the gift of the accordion was the Belgians' way of paying back the indigenous citizenry of Belgian Congo for years of horrendous oppression and exploitation. Kasai Allstars' ""Kabuangoyi"" has a floating quality, its intertwining likembe and marimba parts sounding in strange kinship with the flowing rhumba and soukous that's been the bread and butter of Central African popular music for the better part of a century now. A single vocalist calls out a muezzin-like exhortation, and little trickles of fuzz-encrusted guitar complement his singing at sporadic intervals. Kisanzi Congo share their basic sound with Konono, but their take on it is lighter and looser, less buzzed and fuzzed and full of fluttering likembe phrases. Kisanzi Congo's looseness is actually fairly typical of Kinshasa's electro-traditional music-- it's social music, made for dancing and collective celebration, and the musicians are normal people who've had little to no intense training, and as such it's not a sound that would benefit from having every last little note in its right place. This is also what makes Kenis' decision to record each performance live in a typical venue so apt-- it captures the spontaneity and inventiveness of the music in a way that a studio environment probably couldn't. It also captures the sound of the Kinshasa street and reveals the depth of a music scene as vibrant and unique as any in the world.","Second volume in this Crammed Discs series is a comp that reveals the depth of the unique, vibrant Kinshasa music scene.

Hello Mom!,Modeselektor,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3715e6ef95969323831/1:1/w_160/05e072a6.jpg,2006-01-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5671-hello-mom/,Bpitch Control,"Hello Mom! might not be a dance-music crossover on the level of, say, Röyksopp albums; it might not even be a crossover on the level of Mylo's or Vitalic's, but it's still impressive enough to entertain folks well outside its core audience-- German electro-tech geekery not entirely required. ""Impressive"" isn't even the word: There's hardly a minute on this record that doesn't keep turning out to be way more fun than the last time you heard it. The album comes from Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control, a label whose artists tend to skirt the lines between dancefloor function and home-listening quirk: Even when they aspire to get you deep and sweaty on your nights out, there's something grainy and queasy about it, a kind of twitchy brutalism that reminds you of the person behind the machines. The sounds here that really hit the body-- say, the face-punching blurts on ""Kill Bill Vol. 4""-- stay just as tweaked-out lovable at home. And for every one of them, there's a dozen that are just squishy and colorful and even more fun: Check the back-flipping bass lines on ""Die Clubnummer"", which sound more like dorky robots acting out Three Stooges routines. ""Dancingbox"" cuts up French rhyming into a granular stutter over tweaks that are active and constant without ever crossing over to hyperactive or gratuitous. ""Silicon"" does the same with Sasha Perera's vocals, for one of the best results here-- it's almost as if it were made as a demonstration of How to Improve M.I.A. The front and back ends of this album are full of treats like that-- circus-trick edits, ultra-modern production, and pure sonic candy. What really makes the record worth it, though, is the way it holds up through its more atmospheric center. This stuff slows down nicely, coasting through a few soft electro grooves, pulling off ""thoughtful"" tones like Orbital, and even sliding into some clattery dub. The constant hi-fi tweaks and switchbacks might tread close to distraction-- or just empty calories-- but there's an ear for melody and movement that seems to keep them from ever drifting too far off. So what's scaling back on its crossover potential? Well, the fact remains that it's a technical record. There's emotion (see ""I Love You""), but it's not an emotional package; there's pop, but it's not a human pop album. You get what you'd expect from tracks with names like ""Tetrispack""-- tweaky computer-age fun, thrilling sound, jittery details, robotic rhythmic switchbacks. Albums like this don't hit so many people with deep bonding experiences; they don't wind up on desert island lists. The good news is that we don't live on a desert island, and this album stands a great chance of enlivening a lot of your days here in the non-hypothetical world. At its best, strangely enough, it's a dance imperative free of those deep, dark depths-- and packed with a shiny, geeked-out joy that keeps you cartoon-dancing beside the speaker.","Crossover-ready electro-pop from Bpitch Control.

Funky Skunk,DJ Shadow,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ccea9e61561daa7092/1:1/w_160/fe746577.jpg,2006-01-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2378-funky-skunk/,Obey,"DJ Shadow is often heralded for turning turntablism toward spiritualism and ""serious artistic legitimacy,"" but he's strangely alienated within the realm of contemporary hip-hop. Perhaps that's because Shadow's major albums, ...Endtroducing and The Private Press, seem more indebted to Brian Eno and Aphex Twin than DJ Polo and Eric B. Some even charge that Shadow's considered among our foremost hip-hop connoisseurs only because he veers away from the most volatile and controversial elements of 21st-century rap: a rap producer in name only, a rocker in sheep's clothing, a DJ for those who can't stand the real thing. No doubt he frequently embraces the warm nostalgia of 1970s street funk and the high-falutin' bricolage of 80s avant-garde. Perhaps it's because people still blame him for trip-hop. Perhaps it's just because he's remixed Keane. At any rate, even within the marginal world of turntable fanboys, Shadow seems to be complimented more for his unimpeachable DJ maneuvers than his actual music. How many times has he been mentioned by a rapper you admire? It's a crying shame, really, since Shadow's endlessly inventive repertoire has always been securely founded on the flotsam of rap B-sides. (Check out the first half of Diminishing Returns.) If the movie Scratch accurately portrayed the producer, Shadow spends most of his days careening around vast vinyl catacombs of 1989 rap singles and deep-funk LPs. No wonder he chose to score Dark Days, a documentary about underground derelicts who build enormous cathedral-like residences out of piles of pop-culture refuse. An iPod claims to hold 15,000 songs; Shadow claims to hold around 90 million (""60,000 shelves"")-- and how could anyone doubt him? Funky Skunk-- a limited-edition mixtape sold in exclusive packages with Shepard Fairey's graffiti-chic shirts and accessories-- is addictive and ferocious, and might horrify anyone who's only familiar with Shadow's more serene albums. Here, the grand savior of independent rap flails around with the biggest hits of Three 6 Mafia, Silkk the Shocker, and Too $hort. Entire segments are devoted to grime, gangsta, crunk, Miami bass, and all the other micro-genres that Shadow's acolytes so fiercely oppose. There are indictments of welfare programs, juvenile courts, and geopolitical deceptions, as well as wack niggaz, axes, and old Vipers. The first chorus is worlds apart from the Steve Reich-citing Private Press: ""It's going down in this bitch tonight!"" Witness Shadow's collage of militant beats and high-brow marriage analysis at the start of the mix: It equates the martial and the marital far more effectively than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Not to say he's given up on the underdogs-- the mixtape's first 10 minutes feature about a half-dozen of the best beats I've heard this month and riffs I'm astounded other DJs hadn't yet discovered: Opiate garage meets spectral mid-70s funk; Rastafarian hustlers commandeer a melting organ and relay raps that sound like they were recorded under a moving train; cosmic electro and Velcro synths are rubbed over dusty Stax singers until their glossy vocal performances are scrambled and twisted; David Banner struggles against a torrent of ambulance sirens, broken violins, and plastic beats. It's as if Southern rap were about to split into hundreds of Wagner bars and speed-psych riffs. Funky Skunk succeeds on every possible level: lyrics, flow, beats, novelty, mix, sequence, DJ acrobatics, childish humor, and erudite irony. Even when Shadow invokes a Z-grade Lee Hazlewood clone, the lyrics are so entrancingly bizarre they make Shadow seem more cryptic than gimmicky: ""She's the lady they refer to when they cut the Ace of Spades/ She's the lady that they think of when the night pulls down its shades."" If there's any complaint, it's that Skunk is both physically exhausting-- the pace never relents, even when it probably should-- and veers slightly astray toward the end as the flow becomes more fragmented. Still, it's a testament to Shadow's skills that even these deficiencies can be perceived as virtues under the right conditions. Despite the recent Shadow backlash, this mix solidifies that there are few other hip-hop producers-- in meditative ambiance or glock-wielding top 20 chaos-- who are so consistently stimulating within this increasingly diverse genre.","Limited-edition mixtape blends Shadow's typical production style with sections devoted to grime, mainstream hip-hop, crunk, and Miami bass.

The Complete Guide To Insufficiency,David Thomas Broughton,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ab13d1975652138d77/1:1/w_160/defa782e.jpg,2006-01-16 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1192-the-complete-guide-to-insufficiency/,Plug ResearchBirdwar,"It happens: Potential favorites are easily lost in the shuffle. Some albums remain unheard in piles of promotional CDs; others emerge by chance after a lengthy hibernation to make a delayed march to the disc player. Lucky for us, UK bard David Thomas Broughton's excellent The Complete Guide To Insufficiency falls into the second camp. I've never been a huge fan of Plug Research, largely because experimental electronic music isn't my thing. On top of label bias, The Complete Guide's bland cover art and generic title are ill-fitting. Overlooking these initial strikes, I played the album anyway only to find myself hitting repeat, literally for hours. That was a couple of months ago; now, along with Richard Youngs' Naïve Shaman and Six Organs of Admittance's Compathia, Broughton's acid-folk cycle is a late-night favorite. Dripping with inky ambience, his hypnotic sick-souled mantras are simpler than Chasny's and comparable to Youngs' recent outings, but without the playful Arthur Russell flourishes. Broughton keeps the instrumentation spare: acoustic guitar, looping pedals, minimal drum machine, well-spaced accents (distortion streaks, bells, wooden percussion). At the center is his gorgeous hangdog voice, which recalls a less taciturn Nick Drake with the vocal mannerisms of Antony blended into the dusty, mystical ambiance of Vashti Bunyan. Broughton's a patient conjuror, allowing five tracks to clock in at just under 40 minutes. Reportedly recorded in a single take at Wrangthorn Church Hall in Leeds, the compositions bleed together with only slight variation. The church wasn't simply a goth gimmick; the building really seeps into the songs. For example, the bells that close ""Unmarked Grave"" were supposedly a mistake, a fortunate byproduct of putting things to tape between the incense and pews. The first track, ""Ambiguity"", opens on two minutes of guitar, looped frontward then backward, as if buoying Broughton's lyrics, which are both darkly surreal and heartbroken. ""Ambiguity""'s actual incantation begins with existential questioning: ""How much love can a boy contain in here? How many contradictions can a girl posses up there?"" When the song's pace subtly quickens, he moves into the realm of declarations: ""It's easy to forget where you came from, if there's no question of your return."" The line most indicative of the album's atmosphere-- draped in suicide, murder, and insecurity-- closes the piece: ""I struggle with the nightshade in my blood/ I really shouldn't say it, I really shouldn't say it/ But, I just love what the water does."" Then, when he's said his peace, Broughton doubles his voice-- a technique recalling Antony's gospelisms. These moments of non-articulation, of self-harmonizing are typically the standouts of any given track. The next piece, ""Execution"" starts with Broughton's ohms alongside his playing and tapping of a guitar. Once the somber, plodded mood's established, he layers a vocal line over the backing track. Lyrically, it's a bit of a love song: ""I wouldn't take her to an execution/ I wouldn't take her to a live sex show/ I wouldn't piss or shit on her, would I?/ Because I love her so."" Scat fans may find this a narrow definition of a relationship, but the point's well taken: It's an I would walk 500 miles kinda thing for the down and out. Surprisingly, ""Unmarked Grave"", the tale of a soldier's rotting body and his lonesome gal, is just about joyful in the aftermath of ""Execution""'s ominousness. (Tellingly, the dead guy's mortally wounded with arrows-- Broughton is often reminiscent of some Medievalist, and death by machine gun wouldn't seem right.) It's here the gentle church bells lend the track a funereal beauty, etching themselves into Broughton's one-man, multi-tracked Gregorian chant. The album's weakest song, ""Walking Over You"", is also its most conventional and, thankfully, its briefest. Closer ""Ever Rotating Sky"" ostensibly looks at cannibalism/rape (""The violation of your body, the pieces they fall into the holes, flakes of skin in my mouth, petals trodden into the carpet""), and it resembles the three stronger earlier tracks on a noisier tip. For the last gasp, Broughton carts in a tinny drum machine (rattles/clicks/report), cutting his voice and the instruments into a patch of Reichian chaos. The dicing and reconfiguring eventually mutates ""rotating sky"" into ""rotting inside."" It's an eerie though perhaps unintentional effect. The Complete Guide To Insufficiency might be too homogenous for some, but fans of folk's apocalyptic, alchemical side ('sup, David Tibet) won't have much to complain about. Over the past year, neo-folk's continued to spin into different bifurcations; the glossy hipsters-as-hippies proving less interesting than artists mining stranger material. Aligning himself with scratchy brethren like Nick Castro, Badgerlore, Devendra Banhart's earlier self, and the aforementioned Youngs and Chasny, David Thomas Broughton's debut ought to catapult him somewhere near the head of the bearded class, even if his stateside peers have yet to let these brilliant psalms work their magic.","Like Richard Youngs, Ben Chasny, and early Devendra Banhart, this Leeds native explores the apocalyptic, alchemical side of contemporary folk-pop.

It's a Game,Edith Frost,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be49c0084474cd0c2e79/1:1/w_160/0919408a.jpg,2006-01-15 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3226-its-a-game/,Drag City,"If the ""It's"" in the title of this album refers to relationships and their diverse possible outcomes (which even a cursory listen will reveal to be the case), then Edith Frost is a perennial loser-- the dice go cold in her hands; she loses a turn; she goes directly to jail. It's difficult to unearth a song here that doesn't find Frost in dire romantic straits-- not just heartbroken, but plainly pathetic, unabashedly needy. One waits, in vain, for some sort of inner strength or declaration of independence to emerge; instead, personal dignity is sacrificed time and again to the ghost of romantic love. It's a Game, then, is a country-folk tribute to co-dependency, one lacking the acerbic wit, unexpected joy, and newfound resolve that elevate such music beyond the maudlin. Instead, it's track after track of self-effacement and emotional panhandling, seemingly oblivious to the fact that there's a lot more to life than waiting on a man to let you be happy. The pretty confidence of the music-- Frost has a rich voice and a knack for lilting, breathy acoustica reminiscent of Leslie Feist-- is constantly at odds with the ugly insecurity of the lyrics. Here's Frost on the plinking ""Emergency"", cajoling a restless lover instead of admitting he's a right bastard and moving on: ""You've got so much time for that other woman/ I don't know why you won't spend your time with me."" Maybe it's because, as she sings on the saddle-sore ballad ""A Mirage"", ""As the last boy I loved told me the day we said goodbye/ My heart is too sentimental and his love he could only deny."" And ""What's the Use"", while musically spry, is rife with defeated longing: ""What's the use in trying again when you're only going to break my heart/ Where did I go wrong in my thinking you'd fall in love with a girl like me?"" God. Has Frost ever heard of self-fulfilling prophecy? Her self-degradation is, at best, endearing in spurts, but becomes really frustrating over the course of It's a Game. The smoldering ""My Lover Won't Call"" speaks for itself; ""Larger than Life"" shamelessly wheedles ""Please keep calling me;"" ""Just a Friend"" oozes with unattractive desperation: ""Won't you let me get closer/ Just tell me what I should say/ I don't want it to be over / I don't want this thing to end."" By the time it's all said and done, you sort of want to shake her by the shoulders; turn her on to ""Since U Been Gone""; something.","On her latest Drag City release, the singer-songwriter crafts a country-folk tribute to co-dependency.

Tainted Lunch,Safety Scissors,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a334b1335d7bf1698691/1:1/w_160/e64506af.jpg,2006-01-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6966-tainted-lunch/,~scape,"This stuff is intricate digital disco, squishy laptop house, and fabulous left-field pop-- and none of that is even the main selling point. The real surprises are its warmth and intimacy, humor and whimsy. These qualities aren't necessarily rare in the world of electronic music; there are always people who have more technical skills than things to say, and they've been known to fill the space around their programming with plenty of jack-around jokes. But Safety Scissors' Matthew Curry is not one of them, and Tainted Lunch is anything but the work of a clever brat-- just a loopy, funny, emotion-filled electronic pop record, one that comes off sweet, humble, and downright generous in spirit. I'm inclined to think this is important, especially when some of the decade's freshest music has come from similar places: Junior Boys and the Streets, Max Tundra and Tujiko Noriko, wide swathes of r&b--; all of them bringing the mechanics of electronic music away from the otherworldly and down toward the bedroom conversation. This is a record, after all, that features Curry cheerleading for the fly struggling in his soup, and throughout the record he manages to score smiles and tug heartstrings with the same approach-- a stoner's-eye view of food, housework, war, and (above all) distance. That fine-tuned micro-house sound comes from recording sessions in Berlin with Vladislav Delay (aka Luomo), and there's an American-abroad bemusement running through most of these songs. ""Where Is Germany and How Do I Get There"" has Curry wondering if he could walk the Bering Strait back to California before calling in to what must be work: ""I don't think I can make it in today/ Because Germany is far away."" More chipper is ""Sunlight's on the Other Side"", which frames long-distance love the same way Fievel the mouse once did: ""Dried-out grapes are raisins/ Dried-out plums are prunes/ All for one reason/ The same sun that shines on you."" On ""After Disaster"" you get whimsy in the way that works-- carousel circles of piano-lesson chords and banjo, with Curry and Kevin Blechdom singing about bad luck in kindergarten-teacher voices: ""My pants are wet""/ ""What could it be?""/ ""Did I spill water?""/ ""It's pee!"" Consider the kind of tonal perfection it takes-- and the kind of unassuming soul voice-- to make this stuff seem more loving than arch. Consider that the bulk of this record-- the bulk of those quotes-- feels weighty and serious and heartfelt. Consider the way Curry takes a Rimbaud poem about trench warfare, sets it to deep, drizzly house, and turns its food metaphor (""I am the cheese"") inside out: It's a good approximation of the way lightness and weight play with each other across the length of this disc. Curry has brought a personality out from the washes and drifts of his last full-length, and it turns out to be well-rounded-- one curious enough to interweave goofball pop with fine laptop soul. The music is just as seamless, both remarkable and remarkably unobtrusive. The programming here is intricate enough to reward close listening-- every squish, tick, roll, and stab in its place-- but it doesn't take a laptop initiate to enjoy it: Curry is just as good with the big-picture progressions of his songs, and he seems to know why good songwriting will always beat waving his computer skills in your face. Well-played guitar leads sneak through the speakers, fat woodwinds honk through the bottom end of ""Sunlight's...,"" and the tone of it all runs from proper digital-disco pulse (""Amnesia"") to left-field pop sparkle-- from MRI gone whitebread soul to something almost like those moments where Ween surprise you with a no-joke sweetheart pop song. (See also: digital Serge Gainsbourg jazz when Stereo Total's Francoise Cactus makes a cameo.) It's the plain-spoken voice and skewed writing style that unite it all, and as Curry sings about his rumpled pants and travel, he starts to seem like-- well, kind of like he'd make a good roommate. Try this one out: You can listen to it next time you're cleaning the kitchen.","Intricate digital disco, squishy laptop house, and fabulous left-field pop delivered with warmth and intimacy, humor and whimsy.

The Ape of Naples,Coil,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74dea9e61561daa5560/1:1/w_160/d844e044.jpg,2006-01-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1826-the-ape-of-naples/,Threshold House,"Although the accidental death of Coil's Jhonn Balance in November 2004 came as a horrific shock to his friends and fans, in many ways it seemed an event for which Balance himself was hardly unrehearsed. As his longtime Coil partner Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson has put it, Balance's work has ""described or addressed that Very Moment"" time and again. And so it is on The Ape of Naples, an exceptional collection assembled from Balance's final recordings and earlier, uncompleted material originally recorded at Trent Reznor's New Orleans studio. Given the circumstances of its construction, the album is a remarkably unified work, its every meditative gesture alloyed with a looming, unmistakable sense of impending loss and/or transition. Throughout their 20-year recording career, Coil have struck a careful symmetry between spontaneous, animistic creation and exacting ritualistic structure, often with specific alchemical intentions for each record. So while it is impossible to know what ultimate design Balance had for the material on The Ape of Naples, credit must be given to Christopherson for his skillful and devoted stewardship to this music. Several of these songs-- ""A Cold Cell"", ""Teenage Lightning 2005"", ""Heaven's Blade""-- have previously appeared in another forms. Here, however, Christopherson has significantly reworked each track, mixing electronics and acoustic instruments with the help of sympathetic collaborators Simon Norris, Cliff Stapleton, and Thighpaulsandra-- resulting in an album of astonishing cohesion, vitality, and undisguised poignancy. Judged by the evidence on these 11 tracks, Balance remained a commanding and utterly captivating presence to the end, and these selections do well to showcase his expressive, multifaceted vocals. Augmented by the carnival textures of accordion, hurdy-gurdy, and singing saw, his vocals on the theatric ""Tattooed Man"" has an almost effortless elegance (""There's a man lying down in a grave somewhere/ with the same tattoos as me"") while beneath the agitated electronics and cool jazz snatches on ""I Don't Get It"" his heavily effected vocals spin as just another enigmatic cogwheel in Coil's diabolical engine. The album closes with its most curious track, a cover of ""Going Up?"", the theme song from the long-running British sitcom ""Are You Being Served?"" As the closing song of Balance's final live performance, the cover has taken on an unlikely significance in Coil's history. In their hands it undergoes such an extraordinary transmutation that it'd likely go unrecognized by even the staunchest fans of the BBC comedy. With its tempo slowed to a funereal waltz, the song gathers an eerie, unsettling force as Balance is joined on vocals by Francis Testory, the two alternately repeating the lines ""Going up"" and ""It just is"" with a contented resignation-- as serene a conclusion one could expect from a shaman who never shied from penning his own epitaphs.","This collection was assembled from the late Jhonn Balance's final recordings and earlier, uncompleted material originally recorded at Trent Reznor's New Orleans studio.

Brakhage's death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge his passing. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, Lee Ranaldo began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 Brakhage movie and regularly performs improv concerts at experimental cinema screenings. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and Tim Barnes of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of Brakhage's short films. SYR6, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's peculiar series of noise, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate Brakhage's silent superimpositions and montages in audible form; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound in general. Witness Brakhage's famous words on the incompatibility between his silent films and any form of musical accompaniment: ""I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a non-stop soundtrack of the most distracting order."" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were solely visual-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with aural rhythms. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration. One is certainly entitled to dismiss Brakhage's manifesto as obscenely arrogant gibberish. (It's even reminiscent of Derek Bailey's vitriolic criticism of recorded music, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a guitarist with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol Brakhage by denying his wishes is both awfully disturbing and darkly amusing. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly. Generally speaking, SYR6 teems with the funerary bells and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, catalytic drums, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates brief noir themes. The first track seems particularly laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the very bands they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted Brakhage's subtle dissonance into the sort of raging, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say? Consequently, the most successful moments are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): bruised strings, tinny mic-stand tapping, muffled radio frequencies, zither-like electric effects, Barnes' railroad-spike percussion, Thurston Moore's wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's affinity for manual dexterity and physical texture correlates nicely with Brakhage's experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a 28-minute marathon, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of methamphetic jazz guitar, spectral Western wah-wah, and static so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's luminescent and jarring music, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the spiritual metamorphosis and physical pliability that Brakhage found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps Brakhage would have changed his mind about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes one last time.","Sixth volume in the avant-rock band's SYR series was recorded live (with help from Tim Barnes of the Silver Jews) at the Anthology Film Archives in 2003 as a memorial tribute to experimental filmmaker Sam Brakhage.

Silver Bear Mist,Sunroof!,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5bfc0084474cd0c07c5/1:1/w_160/4f6a4741.jpg,2006-01-12 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7588-silver-bear-mist/,VHF,"Hard to believe it's been two years since the last proper Sunroof! record, but a packed CD (or two) from Matthew Bower holds your attention for a while. What Bower does he does very well, going back to his days leading psych/noise mavens Skullflower, but it's not the sort of music I'm in the mood for regularly. Even as drone goes Bower's work is demanding, foregoing hypnotic drift for frequent dalliances in edge-of-seat abrasiveness. 2003's Cloudz only lasted 70 minutes, which is EP length for Bower, but Sunroof! returns here with well over two hours of blistering sound. Unlike previous two-fers, Silver Bear Mist feels like two separate records. The first disc is a focused exploration of a very limited palette, one comprised primarily of chaotically buzzing synth tones in the upper half of the midrange. It's a particularly sensitive frequency spectrum usually inhabited by shrill voices and the tinnitus-induced ring that follows a loud rock show. Having this delicate place worked over by a man as sonically relentless as Bower will appeal primarily to the masochist. Only ""Bear Melt"", with its meatier chords thick with bass, crude percussion, and terrifically disorienting use of sliding tones, can call itself a prime Sunroof! creation. Disc two, however, has considerable variety and much more to recommend. While the opening ""Be Sure to Boogie"" picks up at the same itchy and scratchy place the record left off, ""Great Empty Display Shelves"" is a fitting monument to the power of barely controlled noise. Here Bower seems capable of wringing any sound imaginable from his daisy-chained effects pedals and crude synths, as hints of gamelan, whale songs, and a twisted rock coda mash together into an accidentally gorgeous configuration. ""Stacked Diamonds"" is a bent mediation on Middle Eastern scales, notes repeated to the point of mantra and processed to sound completely evil. Then the closing ""Trampled Dawns"" finally lets some light in, with a single uplifting chord shoved ever higher by an endless roll of splashing, free jazz-like percussion. Once ""Trampled Dawns"" finishes it becomes clear that Silver Bear Mist misses those flashes of prettiness that made previous records such a complete listening experience. If it is in the fact the most challenging Sunroof! release, the rewards aren't what they should be.","Former Skullflower leader Matthew Bower unveils his latest, lengthy drone excursion.

Holy Fuck,Holy Fuck,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c18ec0084474cd0c336c/1:1/w_160/213745c9.gif,2006-01-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4031-holy-fuck/,Dependent,"Let's just say it: Holy Fuck is a lousy name for a band. There may have once been a time when giving your outfit a name like that would have garnered some controversy, gotten you noticed under the ""any publicity is good publicity"" theory, but now it just looks like you're trying too hard to whip up some stink around you. But that's beside the point-- the most important thing is the music, and Holy Fuck are an interesting band, coming out of Toronto with a couple of vets from King Cobb Steelie and By Divine Right in their ranks and a whole heap of drums with which to assault your tired senses. I couldn't help smiling at the way the quintet opted to open the album: with a distorted sample, swiped from Simon & Garfunkel's ""A Simple Desultory Phillipic (Or How I Was Robert McNamara'd Into Submission)"", of Paul Simon saying ""folk rock"" as a fuzz bass riff crackles behind him. They don't waste much time getting downright nasty from there, as their proudly junky bank of keyboards kicks in with a jumping rhythm, soon to be joined by a rock solid drum beat. Dual drummers Glenn Milchem and Loel Campbell give the band's music most of its focus, pile-driving the beats and creating an unholy ruckus on the numerous build-ups. ""Tone Bank Jungle"" is as much a mission statement as an opener, cramming the band's rhythm'n'noise ethos right between your eyes. The band was formed with the intent of creating the equivalent of modern electronic music without actually using the techniques-- looping, splicing, programming and the like-- of that music. They gathered together the requisite gadgets and instruments and played their first show without rehearsing, and they claim never to rehearse to this day. While this approach leads to plenty of exciting moments and a lot of improvisational tension, it also means that the band doesn't really compose its songs, and as such, there's little in the way of melodic content or any other hook here beyond a beat or toy keyboard ostinato. Where this becomes a problem is on long tracks like ""Korg Rhythm Afro"", a song full of rhythmically chattering bleeps and bloops that relies too much on the way the drums fall in and out of rhythm to give it shape-- it's the kind of thing that might be thrilling live, but on record it's tiring, like being beaten with drumsticks for seven minutes. The album's best track, ""Bontempi Latin"" goes the other way, morphing from section to section as the drums bring the beat through a cycle of stomping breaks, almost jazz-like shuffle and break-neck rock beats, all as the keyboards and guitars graduate from echoing blips to sheets of descending texture, falling like paratroops on the darting percussion. As high as the album's peaks are, though, they are not numerous enough to make this a record I feel compelled to return to. Several listens in, I still barely remember even the most striking moments. I'll speculate that Holy Fuck might cause people to utter their name in a live setting, as they're a remarkably tight unit chock-full of rhythm, but they may want to consider some rehearsal before their next recording date.","Rhythmically adept Beans backup band aims to create the equivalent of modern electronic music without actually using the techniques-- looping, splicing, programming.

Tha Carter II,Lil Wayne,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf1ea9e61561daa77f5/1:1/w_160/00445c9a.jpg,2006-01-12 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4997-tha-carter-ii/,Cash Money,"Something great happened last week on The Tonight Show, poor Leno notwithstanding. Camera on musical guest Lil' Wayne, bassist behind him on pasty octaves, some keyboard ""funk"" preset, really thin till the guitars flange in. This is Alan-born Robin Thicke's ""Oh Shooter"" they're playing, straight-up, and Thicke, on stage beside Wayne, begins his stick'd-up anthem, his breath caught as it would be near chrome. Tune in then and you'd think Thicke was the star and Weezy just his cough-n-pepper hypeman. ""I brought my homeboy with me,"" says standing Wayne of singing Thicke. He's kidding, right? Technically this is Wayne's song called ""Shooter"", but the entire ""song"", down to the track length, is Thicke's original. What a tense performance so far; music played, but you could probably hear a pin drop. This young New Orleans rapper bouncing around on stage with Real Musicians but not much else, good for a laugh or a breakdance or whatever Other-approved televised woop-de-doo-- ""cute"" and ""rap's not so bad after all"" but also ""rapping is easy,"" ""rap=only good as the sample it swiped"". Wayne was holding us at bay, all our presuppositions about his career, his music, his age and color, his responsibility qua artist post-Katrina. If Thicke's the crybaby here, Wayne's the stick-up kid. ""They want me with my hands up,"" sings Thicke, doing that stupid ""raise the roof"" thing. Wayne breaks: ""I'm trying to tell you what I am, baby-- listen."" And after almost two minutes of no talking he bursts the song open: ""So many doubt cos I come from the South, but when I open my mouth the best come out. It's my turn and I'm starting right here today."" And so on-- it's one of those black-and-white-to-technicolor moments after which, if you still don't believe in Wayne, you're just lying to yourself. Granted, Leno won't make ""Shooter"" Wayne's ""song"" (it will be though), and we definitely can't call Tha Carter II his coming-of-age album or something equally corny-- people blew that line on the one before. Fact is, Wayne's still young, and he loves that he can get away with shit-- literally. Firmly keeping a foot in the sandbox, Wayne dabbles scatological throughout (""Dear Mr. Toilet/ I'm the shit""), sometimes even elaborately so (""You niggas small bubbles, I burp you/ I'll spit you out and have your girls slurp you""). Total energy thing, his verses still lack polish and a good edit (e.g. so many goddamn shark jokes), and his skits and ""personality raps"" (cf. ""Grown Man"") spell him out too bluntly, too vainly. And yet, there's ""Shooter"", or ""Receipt"", or ""Get Over"": ""Standin' on stage in front of thousands/ Don't amount to me not having my father."" Lines like this fall outta nowhere, jaw-droppers aplenty-- but ""don't forget the baby"". People who met Wayne on ""Go DJ"" and thought him a lunchroom hack emcee-- who knows what's happened since then, but damn has he learned how to write. His squeak is now a croak, his laugh a little more burly, his flow remarkably flexible. Sometimes he's deliberate like syrup cats (""But this is Southern, face it/ If we too simple then yall don't get the basics"") but when he needs to be, he's nimble as that Other Carter: ""I ain't talking too fast you just listening too slow."" Remy and weed, fast things and women, the corner-- these are Wayne's wax since B.G.'ing with B.G., putting piff on the campus before he ever enrolled in college. What's different, and crucial: no Mannie Fresh electro-dixie beats. Free from Fresh, Wayne is less a novelty-- less Pinocchio on Pleasure Island (cf. 500 Degreez), less that dorm-room poster of the baby giving the middle finger. In fact, no-name nawlins producers run the boards, their crackly soul sampling and that implied return-to-rap roots a perfect complement to Weezy's raspy, sometimes even Miles Davisian voice. On ""Receipt"", which lifts the Isleys' ""Lay-Away"", Wayne's nursery rhyme delivery grants pick-ups like ""my daughter want another/ Sister or brother/ And you looking like a mother"" that rare smooth-crude game, something a young Curtis Jackson wanted out of ""Best Friend"" but didn't quite get. ""I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public,"" he says on ""Money On My Mind."" To an extent, he's right. This is Wayne's show, the album's only guests being Kurupt and Birdman and some r&b; b-girls. Not to say he's ungrateful; it's just that establishing his autonomy, his don't give a fuck, is infinitely more important. Lead track ""Tha Mobb"" really lays the audience/methodology/goals stuff on thick: For five minutes, no chorus, sad piano, he does it for ""the gangstas and the bitches, the hustlers and the hos."" Crossover? ""Whatever."" Mainstream? ""No!"" He refuses to be a Big artist, precisely so he can be a big Artist. Shirking responsibility then? Katrina happened after most these tracks were cut, so let's not be assholes. He worked in a few rhymes after the fact, very simple stuff like ""gotta get the hood back after Katrina"" on ""Feel Me"". But the line that follows is more telling: ""Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for 'FEMA'."" FEMA, that lark, and so goes his point: For relief, he's not responsible. While Wayne hasn't made Tha Carter II a ""Katrina album"" in the obvious respect (cf. that horrendous ""George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People"" song rock critics like because they ""get"" it), he's given New Orleans something much greater-- someone, one of their own, to believe in. ""If I talk it I walk it like Herschel,"" he says on ""Mo Fire"", his syllables out his mouth like smoke rings-- he means sex, other things too.","Veteran rapper breaks from Mannie Fresh and grows up quickly, displaying a flexible flow and more layered lyrics.

The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions featuring Seu Jorge,Seu Jorge,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb53c0084474cd0c281e/1:1/w_160/b70fac1a.jpg,2006-01-12 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4362-the-life-aquatic-studio-sessions-featuring-seu-jorge/,Hollywood,"There's this guy who crawls onto my subway car on my way home from work every now and again. A loud, scraggly man, he always blares, ""Ladies and gentlemen, may I please have a minute of your time."" This is absolutely not a question, and he is certainly not a polite person. He has no legs, nor a wheelchair. He has an acoustic guitar strapped to his back and insists on performing a song. He'll keenly request a wink-wink donation if his tune rocks your world. This man, who we can call Studebaker for the sake of identification, sings very popular, well-known songs like ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""More Than a Feeling"" and ""Bootylicious"". But he replaces them with his own stoopid-clever lyrics that highlight his plight. ""Subway car, can you handle this? No. 6 Line can you handle this? America, can you handle this? I don't think you can handle this!"" He's a great guy; I always give him a buck. Seu Jorge's entrance to the hipster consciousness positioned him as something of a Studebaker. By now the tale of Jorge's re-fashioning of David Bowie's lyrics for his performance in Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic is old hat-- a cute little DVD commentary story or bar stool chat point at Fat Baby. But his lyrical rejigger, coupled with the fact that he strips down every one of these Hunky Stardust-era glamthems into smoky bossa nova, makes him a regular subway hound. Every tune is a crusty, throaty delight. Unlike Jorge's album, CRU, from earlier in 2005, there's lots of joy in his voice. The windswept, acoustic production serves him well. ""Ziggy Stardust"" in particular opens him up to all sorts of wailing and gospelized hoots. The structure and chords are precisely the same. But he interweaves his own little guttural impudence onto as time-tested a chorus as I can recall. Even ""Team Zissou"", the lone original, has got a rollicking early Bowie at the Beeb vibe to it, all croons and crafts with his vocal range. The chorus rips soprano to alto, ""Teeeeammmma Zee-suuuuuuu, underwater, I luhrve you."" Yet at some point you've got to ask yourself what use you'll have for this record. The covers, while stirring, are never going to stack up with the originals. Jorge is an intriguing voice in a continually emerging Brazilian scene-- not quite a successor to Caetano Veloso or Gilberto Gil, but at least a wingman with a sharp eye for social distortion. The breathy CRU said as much. So this is not quite as monumental a release as you'd like to see from a talent like him. Still, as back porch BBQ music? A gem. Hell, I'd give Seu Jorge a buck if I saw him right now.","Acoustic, Porteguese-langugage covers of David Bowie songs, as heard in the Wes Anderson film.

Pretty Hate Machine,Nine Inch Nails,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c404ea9e61561daa805d/1:1/w_160/b51cf0c3.jpg,2006-01-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5804-pretty-hate-machine/,TVTTVT,"2005 was supposed to be the phoenix-like rebirth of Trent Reznor's career, a return from his self-imposed exile to seize back his empire of angst from the acolytes who'd carried his banner during the interim. The Dolby-tricked-out re-release of his 1994 peak, The Downward Spiral, sounded the fanfare, its finely textured bursts of despair and strangely soothing hushed introspections losing little of its alternative-era whollop. But new album With Teeth vampired off this momentum, sounding disappointingly paint-by-numbers despite its success on mostly toothless modern-rock radio. Now comes a reissue of Nine Inch Nails' introduction to the world, a move which could be perceived as another grasp at legacy rehabilitation through past-mining, were it not for Reznor's non-compliance with the release. You see, Pretty Hate Machine has been a neglected child in divorce proceedings, languishing out of print while TVT attempted to settle its affairs with assorted Mr. Potters, who eventually tried to hock it along with other parts of the label's back catalog. As such, PHM returns to your store shelves courtesy of Rykodisc, who licensed the record from that industrial figurehead, Prudential Securities-- after all, nobody says rock like The Rock. Due to these auspicious origins, the new incarnation of Pretty Hate Machine is indistinguishable from the original: no 5.1 surround-sound, no B-side/remix sweetening, no fishnet slipcase/bonus snuff DVD deluxe packaging. Sadly, with no garish extras, there's nothing to distract from what turns out to be a horribly dated album, just as awkwardly out of step with the mid-aughts as The Downward Spiral was unexpectedly relevant. Remastering might've spruced it up, but it's unlikely a digital touchup could keep Pretty Hate Machine from sounding tinny enough to give you that penny-taste in your mouth. Drumbeats are often industrial in the most literal sense, machinery-simulating presets stiff as prosthetics. The rest of the mix doesn't offer any escape routes, filled out as it is with paper-thin synthesizers and Reznor's echo plug-in front-and-center vocals spouting alt.suicide.holiday posts, the razor-guitars and stampeding drums he perfected just three years later on ""Wish"" completely MIA. These failings didn't sink in back when I had ""Head Like a Hole"" cranked up on my Discman on the school bus, but today that and others sound thin, quaint, the furthest thing from dangerous. As a result, Pretty Hate Machine sounds less like NIN's astonishing breakthrough and more like developmental bumbling, leaving one to wonder why it was ever considered otherwise. Perhaps the album was swept up in the hypewaves generated by Reznor's famous afternoon sets at the first Lollapalooza, perhaps PHM reaped the rewards of people being late to the Wax Trax! game. And to tell the truth, it's still possible to see the early vestiges of Reznor's skillful reconfiguration of all those nasty Chicago and German sounds for pop palatability, placing the emphasis on the melody rather than the machinery. Hints at Reznor's considerable studio craft pop up more often in the second half, the breakbeats of ""Kinda I Want To"" momentarily enlivening the limp rhythms, ""Sin"" (probably NIN's most underrated and best early song) seeding the creepy brooding sensations that didn't fully bloom until the Broken EP. But there are just too many embarrassingly distinct time-stamps of 1989-ness to ignore: the hilarious talk-rap vocals of ""Down In It"", that Chili Peppers poppy bass on ""Sanctified"", the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" rip of ""Something I Can Never Have"". Like most self-serious music, time hasn't gone easy on the depressive couplets (fill in the rhyme!: ""bow down before the one you serve..."") and haunted-house keyboards of Reznor's debut, eroding away much of what must've been shocking and novel about it 17 years ago. Unlike The Downward Spiral or Broken, Pretty Hate Machine's re-release reveals the album to be an artifact, perhaps historically valuable, but as anachronistic as Napoleon in a water park.","Out of print for three years, Trent Reznor's debut is reissued by Rykodisc with neither bells nor whistles.

City Fallen Leaves,Comet Gain,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a632c0084474cd0c08dc/1:1/w_160/52d8fcdd.jpg,2006-01-11 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1560-city-fallen-leaves/,Kill Rock Stars,"Organs and synths percolate beneath the songs on City Fallen Leaves, Comet Gain's fifth album of wistful jangle pop, but never as assertively as on ""White Radiance of Eternity"", a frittering seven-minute fuzzball from the band's recent ""Beautiful Despair"" 12"". The song tapped the same vein as the Clientele's ""Losing Haringey""-- rain-slicked spoken monologue over a mid-tempo vamp-- only for longer and with less concrete details, more coruscating electronic drones. Some will find City Fallen Leaves' tighter, strums-and-drums approach more appealing, but it makes a poor backdrop to David Christian's puffed-up musings on mixtapes and the arcana of London post-grad life. Christian does quarter-life crisis with an admirable lack of direction. His bandmates often seem lost, too, but don't blame them: Comet Gain have shuffled through countless incarnations, Christian the only remaining alphamember. Picking up the thread, Christian and co. muster plenty of existential bluster, the keystone of the 13-year-old band-cum-franchise. Unfortunately, Wedding Present beat them to the hankie, while compatriots Belle & Sebastian and Clinic dropped the moleskine confessionals for American viability. Mixtapes qua declarations of love-- fodder for ""The Ballad of a Mix Tape"" and others-- are dull but acceptable; I'd rather read Richardson. The best iterations of Christian's high-romance doggerel dance a simple beat. ""The Fist's in the Pocket"" is hard to love, impossible to hate; the chorus-- two chummy voices chiming charmingly offbeat-- comes fast, easy, predictable. ""Days I Forgot to Write Down"" scampers a six with the breeze of four, plus it brings the spectral synths that made ""White Radiance of Eternity"" so darn sublime. In a way they got lucky with that one, though: Narrating over vamp, even at its best, is all smoke and mirrors. The trick is getting the hoi polloi to follow. Doors did it with narcotics on ""The End"", Velvets with putrid distortion on ""Heroin"". ""The Punk Got Fucked""'s aimlessness embodies its lost protagonist's dilemma (""Should I stay and fight or go out tonight or just turn out the lights?"") too literally, letting organ and fuzz-box'd guitar wander unleashed with only a caveman bassline to anchor. Ironic, then, when the album's backside fails with earnestness, not blas. Song after song puffs an ambered nostalgia, each one turning the same six-string pinwheels. The problem with nostalgia, see, is the slip from poignance into anticlimax happens quickly. So when closer ""Nameless"" clears the air with dynamics and a backbeat (note the chant, ""something is missing,"" maybe meta), it's too late for an album confused by its own ruminations.","KRS issues the band's latest album of wistful jangle pop.

Previously appearing in Don Caballero, Storm and Stress, and Antioch Arrow, the three members of Coptic Light have built careers on blending noisy, off-the-cuff bursts with jazz-inspired noodling. The three songs that make up this release run almost 45 minutes as they swirl from penetrating, stream-of-conscience hyperactivity to dark, ambient droning. ""Mix the Races"", the first track, is the most manic. Kevin Shea's rapid-fire snare drumming is incessant, and the guitar and bass interplay and overlap in degrees varying from perfect harmony to stark contrast. Due to the improvisational aspect, it's often difficult to keep track of what's going on. The track doesn't follow traditional song structures, as there are no noticeable transitions between parts. In fact, the band only lets up once here when, for about a minute, the drums fall away and guitarist Jon Fine drops precise, haunting notes. But before long, it erupts again, and one moment bleeds into the next, creating a dense yet incredibly spastic fabric of bubbling noise. Things change considerably for ""The Horse"", where the first half of the song is built on panning guitar drones and dark, tribal drumming. Things slowly build as the drumming gets more aggressive and more guitar notes begin to split the warble of the bass, but it never reaches the chaotic heights of the previous track. The drums slide seamlessly into ""Eat It High School"", the strongest, and at 19 minutes, the longest, of these three tracks. The most melodic of the bunch, ""Eat It High School"" blends the better aspects of the first two tracks. There's still plenty of convoluted snare-and-cymbal crashing and over-the-top guitar work, but mixed in is a sense that the band is syncing up a little closer than before. For many listeners, the band members' individual talents will be their ultimate undoing. At times, the three musicians seem so lost in showing off their skills that they are hardly functioning as a unit. This is the case on the album opener more than the other two, which is unfortunate for the sequencing of the album. It's these moments where the music tends to become less engaging and more akin to noise rock. But when they hit their stride together, the sound that emerges is a bizarre yet satisfying blend of precision and chaos.","Debut from the post-rock supergroup-- it features members of Don Caballero, Storm and Stress, and Antioch Arrow-- swells with fluid improvisational riffs and dizzying rhythms.

Drinking Songs,Matt Elliott,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4dea9e61561daa744a/1:1/w_160/b248d67f.jpg,2006-01-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2755-drinking-songs/,Ici d'Ailleurs,"In 2003, Matt Elliott released The Mess We Made, the first album created under his own name after years of operation as Third Eye Foundation. Since then, the former member of Flying Saucer Attack and AMP has relocated from Bristol to France, a move which has evidently driven his spectral music ever deeper into the brine. As indicated by its title and dissolute Parisian artwork, Drinking Songs is an album steeped heavily in spirits, both alcoholic and otherwise. On these tracks, Elliott seems to address the world from the sunless interior of an absinthe glass, with his rarified instrumental arrangements serving as the only thin balm available to keep his subjects from capsizing hopelessly into the ink-black, fathomless depths. Marinated in café piano, mournful strings, and delicate guitar, Drinking Songs follows The Mess We Made as another hard step away from the atmospheric jungle textures of Third Eye Foundation. Here Elliott has drawn further inspiration from Eastern European folk and cabaret music, his stately compositions achieving a melancholic drama similar to Tom Waits or the Bad Seeds at their most theatrically downtrodden. What frequently sets Elliott apart, however, are his cascading, impressionistic vocals, as on the sanguine ""The Guilty Party"", where his layered voices recede almost imperceptibly into the background until barely distinguishable from the rest of his quietly nodding solo orchestra. As the album progresses, Elliott broadens his narrative scope from the relatively prosaic romantic miseries of ""Trying To Explain"" and ""What's Wrong"" to the epic tragedy of ""The Kursk"", which is based upon the sunken Russian submarine of the same name. Over Chris Cole's elegiac cello, a multi-tracked Elliott sings ""The water is rising/ and we're slowly dying/ we won't see light again,"" sending loosened voices curling from every corner until their assembled force approximates a shadowy chorale rising as one from the seafloor. And though this 11-minute piece opens with various indistinct thunderstorm and shipwreck sound effects, Elliott handles the material with enough subtlety and melodic dexterity to avoid a descent into trite melodrama. Likewise, Elliott displays a deft touch on ""A Waste of Blood,"" a discreet anti-war track that may hint at the true core of the album's general despair. ""The craters remain from the last time you came/ and seemingly our only crime/ was wrong place and wrong time,"" he sings, until once again his words are submerged by blurred strings and tape effects. The resulting discord leads quite naturally into the album's finale, ""The Maid We Messed"", an extended collage of deconstructed excerpts from the preceding seven songs. Across the album's sole programmed drum break, this track has the feel of a hungover man attempting to recreate the events of the previous evening, its scattered fragments of memory providing a suitably disorienting conclusion to Elliott's ethereal, unsettling collection.","As indicated by its title and dissolute Parisian artwork, here the former Flying Saucer Attack member has created an album steeped heavily in spirits, both alcoholic and otherwise.

A Week of Kindness,George,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe1eb335119a49ed2ce/1:1/w_160/c3d01cc9.jpg,2006-01-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3622-a-week-of-kindness/,Pickled Egg,"What a task it is to capture and live up to sadness. Anyway, this is one of the things we look for in music, and no matter how many times we find it, it's always in need of satisfying. Sad music isn't just an emotional band-aid, it's practically life support, at least for a moment. And there are always a few old favorites to revisit; like the rare friend who knows what it feels like to be you, they somehow understand everything, emphasize all the most important parts of being sad. They validate and heal. It's another way in which we live with music the same way we do with people, and probably confide a lot more. Consequently, when the music doesn't suit our sadness, it's almost offensive. ""How could I even think of playing that at a time like this?"" It's all very dramatic and important, but suitably so. Manchester duo George seem to work solely in the sad realm. Melodies lean, tempos drag, bells and harmoniums resonate in cathedrals of strained optimism: what little time there is for joy is used to drape a gray, rain-soaked filter over everything within earshot. Funny enough, someone sent me an instant message the other day saying that the new album wasn't sad enough. To my ears, A Week of Kindness (which I've repeatedly, Freudianly misread as ""a kind of weakness"") is only marginally less melancholy than their previous music, but so it goes. No greater crime than to be misunderstood, and sad music that isn't ""sad enough"" steps on feet like a steamroller. Nevertheless, I'm still pretty charmed by George. Although their 2003 cult-fave The Magic Lantern was indeed an almost perfect document of romantic gloom, it's not like they've changed their tune. Perhaps there's a bit more light at the end of the tunnel. Still, it doesn't take too many passes through songs like ""The Living Sound"" or ""The New and Better Heart"" to remember your bruised, inner romantic. Suzy Mangion's vocals are still full of lilt, clear and never soaring, but drifting atop homemade arrangements of organ, snare drums, and bells. Before I'd read about ""twee"" music, I used to call this ""precious"" or even just ""modest"", and lines like ""See the living sound; no metronome goes this far"" perfectly encapsulate the kinds of miniature wisdom and diary'd epiphanies so suited to this music. George play music for being alone. Even when Mangion and partner Michael Varity sing together, as on the ultra-purple ballad ""Now You Want to Settle Down"" or ultra-daisy sing-song ""Spend My Time"", they seem dedicated to an audience of one (or less). Elsewhere, the mood is a bit lighter, greatly assisted by stretches of ""incidental"" music like the ""Week of Wonders"" or ""Vanishing Sounds of Britain"". These pieces, short and instrumental, are like islands in between clusters of melancholy, but at a distance are hard to separate from their neighbors. When something threatens to stand apart from the murky depths, as on the bizarrely lo-fi ""Supercharge"" (borrowing a bass line from none other than Smile-era Brian Wilson), it just as quickly disappears, as if sucked into a dark area that my ears never quite figured out in the first place. And then I find myself back in George's living room world, banjo in the corner of ""Song of Degrees"" and waving goodbye after a whistle and swing on ""Older Too"". It's all very dramatic, sure. It's also beautiful, if only to visit once in a while.","Mancunian duo follow its underrated 2003 cult-fave The Magic Lantern with another record of rain-soaked indie pop.

If You're Feeling Sinister: Live at the Barbican,Belle and Sebastian,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a263b1335d7bf16984b0/1:1/w_160/bc3905bb.gif,2006-01-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/638-if-youre-feeling-sinister-live-at-the-barbican/,iTunes,"In September 1997, Belle & Sebastian made their American live debut by playing a pair of CMJ shows at a synagogue in New York City's East Village. At the time, the band's U.S. debut, If You're Feeling Sinister had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences with the music weeklies. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun. What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with could-be fans. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the occasional mumble or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between songs. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer Stuart Murdoch's songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even Murdoch often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' ""Sessions at West 54th"" was deemed unworthy to broadcast. Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, Sinister-- along with a series of early EPs-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. Murdoch himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are his best songs, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried under C-86-quality sound. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering dissatisfaction with Sinister, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties Don't Look Back series-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live in its entirety-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.) The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to correct the fidelity of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of its longtime fans. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with Murdoch and guitarist Stevie Jackson taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five additional players. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering Murdoch's delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and existential drift with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a near-definitive reading of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about the band. The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of ""The Stars of Track & Field"" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. Mick Cooke's ""They Don't Know""-quoting trumpet solo is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the sonic peak. The tracks best served by the live recording are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap ""Me and the Major"", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older Murdoch sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. ""Like Dylan in the Movies"" and ""Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"" don't leave Murdoch as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted backdrops. Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been Sinister's centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of Murdoch's pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between poor decisions and desperation, doubt and faith, a need for change and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to Murdoch's words rather than leaving them stranded. As the band has changed and years have been placed between these track's first airings and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but their malleability, with the once-quintessential ""The Boy Done Wrong Again"" somehow seeming the most distant and out of place track here-- the claim that ""All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&S; now make. That Jackson and Murdoch, charming and almost vaudevillian-like in recent live shows, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to ""hang your head in shame and cry your life away"" is almost quaint, an odd reminder that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on late-night BBC radio sessions playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this. Odd then that the record closes with ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"", another in a string of tracks about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a gallop, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- some overly enthusiastic harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and ""Judy"" could have fit on the band's most recent LP. While arrangements here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, Murdoch's wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a hastily assembled collection of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the pride and tenderness with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more casually thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this part of their past from the safety of a different decade depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like ""Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic.","iTunes-only charity album was recorded as part of ATP's Don't Look Back Series and presumably released in part to finally match the Scottish band's best set of songs with a proper recording of their arrangements.

Lucky Hands,Thomas Brinkmann,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a456b1335d7bf1698926/1:1/w_160/de1e07c5.jpg,2006-01-10 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1111-lucky-hands/,Max Ernst,"Love that feeling, when the opening track is so thoroughly great on first hearing you just can't wait to hear the record that follows. ""Drops"" leads off Thomas Brinkmann's latest and it rips, the kind of rigidly funky early-80s drums that made James Murphy pick up sticks as a teenager wedded to a minimal bass pulse, with fountains of jazzy variation coming from backwards beats and synth rushes that swoop down on the groove in hopes of tearing off a piece. Then the voice and nothing else: ""Drops"", which Brinkmannn eventually lets slip that the sample comes from a mentholyptus advertisement ""M-m-m-m medicated cough drops."" Yes. Of late, Brinkmann prefers monkeying around to consistency. His last few albums have a few of these burners, a few experiments that sometimes fall flat, and then a number of punchy if not terribly memorable dubby techno tracks interspersed throughout. This time Brinkmann puts his spin on pop, incorporating vocals here and there and even going so far as to cover Morrissey. On ""The More You Ignore Me the Closer I Get"", Brinkmann brings in Natalie Beridze to sing, whom he knows from prior collaborations on her TBA project. While TBA's strange and unpredictable 2005 release Annulé (also on Max Ernst) has something to recommend, as a vocalist Beridze is not much, with a style that basically consists of reciting words in a bored monotone. Electronic producers taking on the Smiths/Morrissey songbook has been an exciting mini-trend in the last five years but this is a missed opportunity. Her contributions to the title track and ""Margins"" are slightly more interesting, perhaps because expectations are lower, but still not enough to make me wish for more. Ignore these average-at-best moments and you have two-thirds of an excellent album. The man himself sings on ""Maschine"", casting a goth shadow to a dense and bubbly techno concoction, but it's the vocal-free tracks that really affirm his talent. ""Jacknot"" actually works as a pop instrumental, with a progression and tunefulness that suggests an ace videogame theme expertly remixed for the dancefloor. ""Work"" is punchier than ""Drops"" and just as compelling, foregrounding Brinkmann's always propulsive programming. And really, for Brinkmann, that's the thing. His rhythm style has always brought to mind the word ""swing"" and on ""Charleston"" he makes it official, adding respectful but effective beats to a fully intact live performance of the tune by Django Reinhart. In this way Lucky Hands ends as good as it begins; shame about the sag in the middle.","Floor burners, sonic experiments, and punchy, dubby techno from the artists also known as Soul Center.

Hesitation Eyes,The Foxymorons,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec4abf31b7dc71561cb/1:1/w_160/f63e7627.gif,2006-01-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3353-hesitation-eyes/,Heatstroke,"The Foxymorons are a duo of childhood friends hailing originally from Mesquite, Texas. Their first two albums established their love of classic pop and the alt-country sounds of the mid-90s, but the trail went cold after 2001's Rodeo City as David Dewese and Jerry James worked on other things in separate parts of the country. Hesitation Eyes is their long-time-coming third LP, recorded via the ever-popular tapes-through-the-mail technique. Strangely, it's also their highest-fi record yet. Dewese and James alternate lead vocals, switching off every other song for most of the record. One of them-- they never specify who sings on what-- has a powerful, dusky croon, while the other gets by with a cranky indie rock croak. The two sound best, though, in two-part harmony, especially on the title track, which closes the album with a blast of glorious falsetto power-pop, tambourine filling in the backbeat amid thumping toms and descending guitar chords that read like a tour of Cheap Trick's greatest hits. The band takes a similar approach on ""Just Because"", which rightfully should be the album opener, but is instead slotted behind ""Harvard Hands"", a song that's too slow and uneventful for track one billing. Sequencing errors aside, the record is characterized by strong songcraft and a few nicely chosen sonic flourishes, such as the e-bowed lead guitar on ""Everything Changes"" or the weird, spacey noises that open ""I'm Still in Love"" in a universe somewhere parallel to the minimal piano and drum shuffle of the song itself. As such, Hesitation Eyes is a sturdy album, a slightly more sophisticated update of the band's past output, and an indication that even with a non-traditional working relationship, the duo still has room to grow.","Pop/alt-country duo issue their third LP and first created via the ever-popular tapes-through-the-mail technique.

Anthrology: No Hit Wonder (1985-1991),Anthrax,by: Cory D.

For Metallica, Slayer, and, to a lesser degree, Megadeth, success has only periodically waned, but Anthrax, while massively popular and rightly influential in their heyday, never recovered from the 90s post-grunge fallout. Now, more than 15 years after the disbandment of their key lineup, Island attempts to reclaim some of Anthrax's lost glory (and fanbase) with the double-disc retrospective Anthrology. Representing more than half of the songs from each of the band's strongest records-- 1985's Spreading the Disease, 1987's Among the Living, 1988's State of Euphoria, and 1990's Persistence of Time-- as well as a careful selection of B-sides and EP cuts, this compilation makes the most effective possible argument for the group's re-evaluation. Anthrax began their career in conventional early-80s metal form, emulating heroes Judas Priest, and neither their classic lineup nor their signature sound would solidify until singer Joey Belladonna brought his crisp, often theatrical vocals to the band's second full-length, 1985's Spreading the Disease. Though even this outing is clearly the work of a band still searching for its strengths, it plants the seeds for what was to follow. Anthrology kicks off with a handful of tracks from the underrated album and therefore doesn't make as strong an initial entry as it might have, had it drawn its opening material from the band's vastly superior 1987 follow-up, Among the Living. Thanks to beefed-up production, sophisticated arrangements, and hints of crossover hardcore, Among the Living gave Anthrax their first real breakthrough, and appropriately, the album's crunchy rhythms, howling vocals, dense riffing, and comic-themed lyrics defined the band through the remainder of their first decade. Standouts ""Caught in a Mosh"", ""I Am the Law"", and the title track became so highly regarded within the band's catalog that they remained live set staples even through the post-Belladonna 90s. Following these highlights, the inclusion of two cuts from 1987's I'm the Man renders that EP entirely useless: The novelty of the title track, at once both a piss-take and homage to the Beastie Boys and early Rick Rubin hip-hop, managed to strike a chord with listeners outside the band's immediate fanbase, while the group's stellar cover of Black Sabbath's ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" still holds its own with the original in terms of sheer aggression. Even the band admits that State of Euphoria was a weak follow-up to its previous outings. In Anthrology's liner notes, they complain of being rushed and regret not spending more time on the material. Their negligence shows: While not necessarily dead weight, these tracks lack the focus and vitriol of Anthrax's prior efforts, playing instead to the band's rep as metal's resident knuckleheads. After a two-year break, they followed up with the more substantive Persistence of Time, a highly divisive offering that would mark the end of this lineup. Perhaps an attempt to shed their nice-guy image, the album serves as the angriest and most mature release of their career. ""Time"" is particularly powerful: A seven-minute thrash marvel, its relentless rhythm and crushing guitar riffing established the album's mood, and the other cuts represented from that album accentuate its significance. Two B-sides close out the collection: The first is their infamous 1991 Public Enemy cover ""Bring the Noise"", featuring Chuck D himself, whose gruff bark always sounded great against the loudest possible backdrops; the other is a French-language version of ""Antisocial"", which while potentially improved in its native tongue (it was originally recorded by French metalheads Trust) is ruined by poorly layered vocals and obvious overdubbing. Whether Anthrax will ever see a renaissance remains to be seen. It's certainly possible that they may not, particularly given their good-natured sense of humor, a serious taboo in metal culture. But though their records largely faded from popularity during the great 90s alterna-rock boom-- a situation compounded by the band's increased appreciation for non-metal-approved hip-hop (e.g. anything that wasn't Body Count), and most fatally, Belladonna's departure and eventual replacement by Armored Saint vocalist John Bush-- this compilation should serve to convince ex-fans and newcomers that, if nothing else, Anthrax's creative apex proved them an innovating force in a genre that may at times place too great a value on time-honored tradition.","2xCD compilation gathers the best from the New York trash metal band's classic Joey Belladonna-led lineup.

ANR So Far,Awesome New Republic,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d6b1335d7bf169835c/1:1/w_160/dbae5485.gif,2006-01-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/495-anr-so-far/,Sutro,"They have the worst name since Ninja High School. They recorded half of this album in a bedroom. And they appropriate dance and pop music like smarmy indie kids, grabbing whatever they want and singing in a crooning falsetto lyrics that barely take themselves seriously. Every warning light went off when I started listening to Awesome New Republic, and yet I can't stop playing the album, which not only lives up to its own jokes and conceits but delivers some of contemporary indie rock's best neurotic party tracks. A one-time quintet now pared down to two guys, Miami-based ANR build most of their songs on Brian Robertson's keys and drum machines and Michael-John Hancock's vocals. They're an indie rock band at heart, but my bloglish isn't deep enough to categorize everything they're doing, from electro and funk, to the freak folk-nodding sparse harp and acoustic guitar on ""Dirge"". And ""Kill South Beach Dead"" is a punk anthem sung by grown-ups, and probably closer to how these guys sounded when they were pissed-off Miami teens: ""Roll deep and kill South Beach dead/ Drop out of magnet school/ Sign up for special ed."" The lyrics are smarmy jokes just barely pulled off. Sensitive slow dance song ""Going Down"" turns out to be about blow jobs-- ""My eyes may dart around the room/ But I just want to fill your mouth""-- and it namechecks Barack Obama, just because it feels so right. But sometimes the juxtaposition of crass and serious lyrics come off as nigh-brilliant, or at least brilliantly uncomfortable, like when Hancock's admiring the c-section scar on his married lover and tells her it gave him ""an erection about near the strength of my arm."" I don't know where Hancock's coming from as a singer. Are his bouts of comic crudeness supposed to undercut the smooth crooning sex machine persona that he sometimes adopts? Or is it just random? He has the pipes to carry these songs, even if sometimes you can still hear a drunk indie kid who took a bet to sing ""Cry Me a River"" at a karaoke night, and realized he could pull it off. Right now, he's something like a Har Mar Superstar with ideas, perspective, and a brain, but he could probably take more lessons from Bryan Ferry. But musically, ANR So Far is fully formed and totally enjoyable, pulling off every lurch from genre to genre. It's loaded with great moments, from ""Going Down""'s sentimental keyboard line to the way the horns erupt like a flock of birds in the pre-coital bliss of ""The Clap"". I'm a sucker for a record where you can hear the band throw a hundred random ideas into a pile and watch every one fall into place. To paraphrase their song, this debut comes from magnet school and special ed, but they strike the right balance between the two.","Neurotic indie rock party tracks from the Miami-based duo.

Livin' Fear of James Last,Nurse With Wound,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44c69fc7814a47cd858/1:1/w_160/6faa80cb.jpg,2006-01-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5872-livin-fear-of-james-last/,Castle,"Considering the length of his career and the diversity of his recordings, it's somehow reassuring to know that Nurse With Wound's Steven Stapleton has always pondered the same morose themes with the same relentless gravitas. But behind all of his eccentricities-- the gothic song titles, the experimental tape loops, the Lautréamont quotes, the sex and violence, the gnomic pseudo-Rosicrucian claptrap-- there's also a perpetual obsession with the same silly objects. The man never tires of bodily fluids, humming toddlers, and barnyard sound effects. I have no idea if this contradicts or strengthens his occultism, but neither of these tendencies-- the darkly surreal or the goofily quotidian-- has grown old over the course of the past quarter-century. He gets away with his pessimism and extremism because his tongue is so firmly pressed against his bloody cheeks. In the same spirit, Stapleton once claimed to only ""make up songs about being born""-- and he's been born hundreds of times. By anyone's count, he's released over 100 albums and EPs since Nurse With Wound's 1979 debut, Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella, and covered everything from scathing noise to lilting new-age. The man released 10 CDs in the past 12 months. As I write this review, he's preparing a limited-edition absinthe-paraphernalia box. Sure, it's easy to deride his eternally unfashionable oddities. It's even easier to just give up on the whole enterprise, since who could possibly have the time to sort through this horde of recordings? Not even Stapleton, apparently-- his new double-disc retrospective ""variety pack"" seems to bounce around from the mid-1980s to the late-90s like obscure vinyl singles were just falling from the sky. There's simply no way Stapleton could satisfy everyone with Livin' Fear of James Last. It would either have to compile easily obtainable singles at the expense of long-time fans or promote obscure 12-inches at the expense of neophytes. His approach is to not even try to balance the equation. Two of Nurse With Wound's most legendary albums-- Merzbild Schwet and Homotopy to Marie-- aren't represented at all. In fact, there are virtually no songs from the outfit's most fertile period (1980-84), one-third of the pieces are edited, and a good chunk of the album was available on Stapleton's prior compilations, Automating, Volumes 1 & 2. But, like his dadaist heroes, Stapleton makes arresting sequences out of utter chaos, and James Last is no exception. It's nearly impossible to discern which tracks come from which album, or even which decade. While most mid-80s electronic and tape-based albums sound increasingly primitive in the Age of iBook, NWW's deafening armory continues to shock and pulverize with ribald energy. Chance Meeting's ""The Six Buttons of Sex Appeal"" shreds moaning-infant samples with piston percussion and haywire pager bleating. ""Dirty Fingernails"" tempers its rusty wheezing with Looney Tunes caricatures, seeming more like a precursor to Negativland than power electronics. Thunder Perfect Mind's ""Cold"" begins with electrocuted xylophones and then winds through the history of 20th century experimentalism, from classical serialism to sulfurous noise. NWW earned early accolades for this uncompromising brand of corrugated static and angst, but Stapleton hit a wall in the late-80s and began diluting his more out-there work with unpredictable elements of pop, dub, and international folk. Drilling klezmer and brass bands make show-stopping appearances. ""Two Halves and a Shine"" torques Cadillac-loving hip-hop. And on 1997's ""Subterranean Zappa Blues"", Stapleton pays the obvious homage to Dylan and Freak Out-era Mothers, but ends up sounding more like low-budget Tom Waits, all grimy bass and kazoo orchestras. In recent years Stapleton has redoubled his efforts to create eerie, make-believe field recordings. Nothing in his heralded early days is as evocative as the muted lunar frequencies and bent antennas of 2002's ""Ag Canadh Thuas Sa Speir"". Even better is the dark National Geographic rhythms during the psychotropic menagerie of his Current 93 collaboration ""Die, Flip or Go to India"". Of course, if the sheer range of moods and instruments here leaves some inevitably dull gaps, there are flickers of brilliance everywhere. The entire first disc constitutes some of the most rewarding and affective music of the last several years, while the second is more dependent on ominous and bizarre monologues. They're still entertaining but not as compulsively listenable as NWW's purely instrumental work. (The one exception is the near-perfect synthesis of hilarious narrative and chilling ambiance on ""A New Dress"".) Even fans with dozens of albums have probably heard only a fraction of these pieces. Conversely, James Last is virtually the only primer available for those who've never delved into the fearless mayhem of the NWW discography.","Steven Stapelton attempts to sum up his prolific career of gothic song titles and experimental tape loops in a mere two discs.

If taking swings at them seems easy, it ought to. In the aftermath of late-70s garage-rock hangovers, they sound exactly as you'd expect-- hints of new wave crossing paths with uninspired power-pop and jackleg dance-rock.

The reality is, cutting a decent record takes more than a kooky stageshow and an insatiable urge to embarrass yourself. It also takes more than handclaps, call-and-response vocals, and dumb cheerleader cadences-- which, incidentally, just about sums up Morningwood's current single ""Nth Degree"", a kind of theme song the band is pushing as a means of introducing themselves to an apathetic public. Where better throwbacks such as Brooklyn-based Blood on the Wall overcome their heavily earmarked influences, Morningwood don't even try to put a unique spin on their pilfering: Their tracklist reads like an AudioScrobbler profile, systematically tallying new wave and glam ingredients in ways only machines and computerbrains can. Like many style-over-substance rockers before them, Morningwood sink or swim largely on the strength of its frontperson, in this case Chantel Claret, an ingenue undeservedly netting comparisons to Karen O and Siouxsie Sioux. Though a touch of early Pretenders or Runaways may occasionally poke through for necessary grit, Claret snags more persona and influence from pop princesses past and present: ""Nth Degree"" is a poor woman's Gwen Stefani rapping on Franz Ferdinand demos, replacing the now-legendary ""B-A-N-A-N-A-S"" chant with the vastly more mindless ""M-O/ M-O-R/ M-O-R-N-I-N-G/ W-O-O-D."" Similarly, ""New York Girls"" spoils the album's best bassline with a shoutout straight from Bring It On: ""N-N-N-New York girls, come on, you know you're hot/ A-A-A-Attitude, and that's what makes you rock!!"" That attitude carries over to Claret's lyrics: ""Take Off Your Clothes"" painfully xeroxes ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", subbing teen angst for locker room hormones as she gasps, ""Your happy trail, it's in my happy trail/ And your treasure trial, let's see what goes down!"" until ex-Spacehog guitarist Richard Steel ejaculates an imitation Joey Santiago riff for the chorus. Here and elsewhere, producer Gil Norton immaculately regenerates his past work for Pixies and Echo & the Bunnymen, though even occasionally recycling those great old sonics can't rescue these songs. As if the songwriting didn't show its wires enough, ""Nth Degree"" invites you to ""rock n' roll,"" ""disco,"" and ""turn up the radio,"" but does so with tongue-in-cheek instead of fists in the air. So not even Morningwood take themselves too seriously, but instead of offering playful, engaging pop music, we get new wave retreads and a couple of rock journeymen and the whole thing comes off like an overgrown episode of MTV's ""Making the Band"".","Next in a line of NYC retro-fetishists, Morningwood's LP reads like their AudioScrobbler, systematically tallying new wave and glam ingredients with the utmost clarity.

Whohm,Rah Bras,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30c13d19756521389d2/1:1/w_160/8f26461d.jpg,2006-01-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6929-whohm/,Lovitt,"Philly, right? That was my guess, at least, on hearing these maquillaged soft-vowel-lovers. Sixth boroughites like their garments bright and their synths dug up on eBay. Or maybe it's the other way round. Either way, Rah Bras meet the criteria then wrap their wares in goth bondage. Only they rep Richmond. The canard of spazz rock is that it's rarely all that spastic. Need New Body and Polysics play it too straight rhythmically to inspire convulsive dancing-- at least among the non-pill-popping set. Bablicon jumble the beat like lotto balls but they're hardly paroxysmal. In Hella we find stiff angles and sufficient contortion, but how much technical proficiency makes a contradiction in terms? Sure, Rah Bras mathematize enough compound meters to keep a Modern Drummer nerd busy for a month. Their struggle, however, is in the process they can sacrifice their power. Recourses are motorik eighths and hard backbeats, like on opener ""As She Rah"", which gridlocks swirling synth gak with bouts of Queensryche-style double kick. ""Skin = Chronized"" follows with ugly, zippering synths and burning-fuselage static, but again towering drum pads do some spinal readjustment. On songs like ""Herculine Androgyn"" and ""War Ribbing Ode"" the Rahs abandon structural precepts altogether, riding stiff, blocky rhythms like a mechanical bull. The latter, which combines metal kicks and a very guitar-like synth run, hints at jammier underpinnings, and indeed, the band imagines some not-too-distant nexus of the universe where Dream Theater and Andrew WK intersect. If Whohm's rhythmic linearity doesn't exactly secure Rah Bras' spazz badge, neither does its tenderness. Two longer, groove-finding pieces exhale and machinate at easier tempi: ""Venis"", brassy with a flatulent bassline, features ethereal female vocals above the nastiness. They're complemented by a surprisingly delicate filigree of synths, airier than Air. ""Mother Put the Wheel Away I Cannot Spin Tonight"" hops on the recent trend toward sentimental tokenism-- specifically, it's the kind of slowed-up, restrained, slightly mawkish, melody-fluent tour de force with which Maxïmo Park (""Acrobat"") and Yeah Yeah Yeahs (""Maps"") disrupted their albums' track orders. Call it spazz, chopped and screwed. Whohm is an itinerant half hour. Forget semantics for a sec and there's still no obvious, practical way to term it. Which is to say: Rah Bras have hit upon an attractive disjunct, but ambivalence always problematizes itself. Had they structured the album more decisively, without such incoherent chiaroscuro, and with more heart-stoppers like ""Mother"" in place of the wonky padding, it would have made more sense. But then, eBay fashionistas think clash is a gas-- even, evidently, in Richmond.","An attractive disjunct between spazz rock, rhythmic linearity, and a surprising touch of tenderness.

You Are (Variations),Steve Reich,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24bea9e61561daa49db/1:1/w_160/d8f69242.jpg,2006-01-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6744-you-are-variations/,Nonesuch,"Urban activity: buses moving; keypads clicking; bikers cutting off cabs; window washers scaling up a half completed skyscraper; the distant wail of an ambulance siren, and its sudden pitch modulation as it zooms past, carrying a rush of wind and a trail of receipts, wrappers, or the rare leaf; the clang of the subway; cash registers opening, closing, opening; everyone is counting something: time, money, appointments, each other; the whistle of a traffic cop and hundreds of half-heard conversations in the street. The flurry of the city isn't something best described as ""beautiful"" so much as alive, unstoppable, cruel, and complex. American composer (and native New Yorker) Steve Reich has been writing the definitive city soundtrack for 40 years. From his early tape pieces ""Come Out"" and ""It's Gonna Rain"", to his now classic minimalist works-- though Reich would certainly scoff at the term-- Drumming and Music For 18 Musicians, to more recent works bother greater in scope and somehow conventionally attractive (Tehillim, Different Trains, The Desert Music), he's invented a sound that nails both the intricate detail and speed-ridden blur of some abstract ""downtown."" Where Philip Glass's music from the 1960s and 70s is vaguely futuristic and precise, Reich's is warm. Where Terry Riley, who never felt a particularly strong allegiance to the minimal aesthetic in the first place, is boundless and organic, Reich is brainy, propulsive, and hardened to the interiors of a metallic landscape. I read someone call him the ""greatest living American composer,"" and though any all-encompassing title is debatable, you'd be hard pressed to find a more fitting example of individualism and stubborn will so often identified with this place. You Are (Variations). is Reich's first CD of new material since the not altogether warmly received Three Tales (2002). If the composer has suffered complaints from critics of lacking ambition in recent years, he hasn't let that affect his writing: You Are is prime Reich, using choral and orchestral elements similarly to older pieces like Tehillim and The Desert Music, but seeming as rhythmically driven as anything he's done in years. Harmonically, he sticks to majors and relative minors (that is, a minor key that utilizes the same notes as a major one, but starts from a different point in the scale)-- a common Reich device-- thereby blurring the line between different tonalities. He uses a choir to impart text translated from Hasidic mystical verse: ""You are wherever your thoughts are"", ""Explanations come to an end somewhere,"" and the idea of saying ""little and do much"". Words are repeated and spread out over great lengths, so the end effect is not one of narrative but of words as purely musical ingredients. The ""variations"" in You Are take up most of the CD, but the closing track is Reich's Cello Counterpoint, featuring cellist Maya Beiser (Bang On a Can) overdubbed eight times to create a surprisingly dense string ensemble. As Reich points out in the CD insert, the cello is great because its capable of resonating clearly in a very wide range-- this piece was actually written for a full string octet, but its marked accents and interweaving melodies sound great all performed by one person. There is a slight similarity to Different Trains for string quartet, though Cello Counterpoint is nowhere near as ""industrial,"" sounding more conventional, perhaps less confrontational, yet still unmistakably Reich. As with the You Are tracks, the constant rumble of motion fills up whatever mental space I have to drift away from the music.","The composer's first new work since 2002's Three Tales finds him working with choral and orchestral elements, but is as rhythmically driven as anything he's done in years.

Pink,Boris,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a3c0084474cd0c0529/1:1/w_160/4bfb1dba.jpg,2006-01-09 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1185-pink/,DiwphalanxDiwphalanx,"In underground metal years, Boris are senior citizens: Their self-released debut full-length, Absolutego, dates back to 1996, and compilations were hosting their material two years prior to that. But as invigorating as some of their earlier records are, the band didn't begin to gain a substantial following outside the metal world until 2003's outstanding Akuma No Uta-- parodying the artwork of Nick Drake's Bryter Layter-- struck a chord with independent music fans seeking an antidote to the more polite pop sounds of the Shins, Sufjan, and Death Cab for Cutie. Now, following more than a decade of hard labor and a swarm of 2005 releases, the trio gives their ever-expanding audience something to chew on: Pink is their best album yet, and by some distance the most accessible of their career to date. The past 12 months have been increasingly kind to louder and more challenging artists, but even if Sunn0))) hadn't droned onto discerning hipsters' iPods, it's not difficult to imagine the awesomeness of Pink-- a supremely well-paced rock'n'roll album that's quickly winning over even long-suffering metalphobes-- helping these Japanese veterans leap-frog indie kids into a New York Times Arts & Leisure mention. If you don't believe me, sneak a listen to the spaced-out seven-minute opener, which manages to combine the best elements of classic British shoegaze and Sigur Rós with bliss-out metal faves Jesu and Isis. Just don't bank on the rest of the album to follow in its footsteps. After all, the three folks behind it-- guitarist Wata, bassist/vocalist Takeshi, and drumming vocalist Atsuo-- are the same atom-smashers who nicked their named from a Melvins song, operate the Walmart-friendly Fangs Anal Satan record label, and downshift from blown-out Motörhead to Earth on a dime. They've collaborated thrice with Merzbow, worshipped amplifiers with multitasking experimental rock legend Keiji Haino, and chilled with noise legend Masonna. Put simply, they're too restless (and ambitious) to fixate on a single style. So, after allowing the opener to evaporate, Boris jump-cut to the album's title cut-- a full-throttle psych riot. Track three's high-octane guitars circle Atsuo's ""yeah""'s and ""ooh""'s until treating us to a magnificent feedback'n'drum finale. Track four ups the fuel intake, sporting Pink's highest in-the-red ratio, while track five sweeps aside its predecessors with a pile of industrial Melvins sludge topped with sheering Blade Runner delay, six-string atmospherics, and angstful, wailed vocals. Then, as that brief respite passes, ""Electric"" cranks the cowbell for two minutes of instrumental boogie, replete with tiny post-punk guitar daggers closing out the song. And there's still more distorted head space to follow, all of it well-stitched and feral. To keep it brief, key moments include: 1) the rising/falling near-pop vocals and final wall of fuzz on track seven; 2) stoner handclaps and Olivia Tremor Control studio effects on track eight; and 3) the textural shift of track nine, where bone-dry, gutteral drums and crashing junk-shard cymbals overtake the bass fuzz and vocals completely. Enter the finale. Ten seconds of silence introduces the gentle strum and softly brushed drums of the penultimate ""My Machine"". Its mood hearkens back to the opening song, briefly reprising its blissed-out tone, but two minutes later, reveals itself instead as a forward-looking antidotal preface to Pink's final 10-minute juggernaut and standout track. The closer delivers an absolutely massive wallop, overlapping entropic vocal lines with furious ambient spillage. I used to think that, of everyone in the punk realm, Unwound or Drive Like Jehu had the best control over their feedback flutters, but this thing's gonzo in its perfectly dense acrobatics. And best of all, its unshakably addictive refrain, blistering, scorched-out guitars, thunderous, supercharged rock, and countless change-ups not only warrant its extended length, but make it feel about half as long as it actually is, and keep the listener fully engaged throughout its entire runtime. As their timeline suggests-- or, to be more accurate, as their history makes it impossible to guess-- Boris could follow Pink with an hour of fried electro-acoustic guitar, powerbook, and piano glitches. Or they could soundtrack a short film in braille. Then, of course, there's Altar, their much-anticipated upcoming collaboration with Sunn0))). But for now, basking in Pink's riptide, Wata, Takeshi, and Atsuo are 2006's balls-out riff-makers to beat. The bar's been raised high and early, rockers-- don't bump your head when you try to sneak under it. ","Japanese sludge trio unleash their most melodic, conventionally structured, and aggressively addictive LP to date: Flirting with shoegaze and ambient, Pink is a 47-minute frenzy that welcomes 2006 with open arms, bludgeoning fists, and a call to arms against MOR complacency.

Hey!: Live Pixies 2004-2005,Pixies,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08e13d19756521383f4/1:1/w_160/774bbeda.gif,2006-01-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6320-hey-live-pixies-2004-2005/,eMusic,"Are the Pixies still the Pixies? The four musicians performing the 28 tracks on Hey!: Live Pixies 2004-2005, which were culled from performances in 17 cities, are the same four people who performed together in small venues during the late 1980s and early 90s, who recorded the influential and beloved albums Surfer Rosa and Doolittle, and whose conflicting egos led to their infamous demise via fax machine. The line-up remains the same-- octopus-armed David Lovering on drums, Joey Santiago on guitar, bassist Kim Deal, and Charles Michael Kittridge ""Frank Black Francis"" Thompson IV leading the group down into the depths among the crustaceans and sea gods-- but the band itself seems noticeably different: The Pixies' legacy has solidified in the 12 years since their breakup, which inevitably affects how its members play their music and how we hear it. Released initially through eMusic.com (and later this month via other internet retailers), Hey! includes popular choices like ""Here Comes Your Man"" and two versions of ""Wave of Mutilation"" (the traditional, and the ""UK Surf"" b-side version) along with album tracks from nearly all of the band's releases, which makes it a useful counterpart to 2004's Wave of Mutilation: The Best of the Pixies. Despite covering numerous shows, Hey! still retains the shape of a single, very long concert. It's difficult to think of better back-to-back openers than these fierce renditions of ""Planet of Sound"" and ""Debaser"", especially when ""Gouge Away"" follows. ""La La Love You"" is a strangely diverting intermission, ""Vamos"" closes the show (despite Lovering losing the beat once or twice), and ""Gigantic"" is the evening's only encore, with the band members wishing each other good night on the outro. What it lacks in stage banter and crowd response Hey! makes up for with a strong tracklist and careful sequencing. The Pixies don't dramatically reinvent many of these songs, but instead give them alternately ferocious and workmanlike run-throughs that are, above all else, faithful to the originals. The most drastic reinvention is the acoustic take on ""Here Comes Your Man"", which gives the song a shambolic gait that plays up its main ascending riff, but mostly Hey! contains leaner and often more aggressive versions of favorites like ""Planet of Sound"", ""Mr. Grieves"", and ""Subbacultcha"". Not surprisingly, these songs prove extremely durable, retaining all the nervy weirdness and jittery explosiveness of their earlier incarnations. Black even hits all the old barks and whoops and rockmejoes (especially on ""Crackity Jones"" and ""Bone Machine""), which at first comes across as rote and practiced in contrast to his more seemingly spontaneous studio versions. Fortunately, his vocals on Hey! never slump into mimicry of his younger self; rather, his tics remain as crucial to and as inseparable from the songs as their lyrical and guitar riffs. Despite the looseness of the dynamic and the astringency of their sound, the band reveals an affectionate devotion to these songs that countervails any hint of in-it-for-the-money opportunism behind the reunion. But while they play the same songs in roughly the same way, these Pixies aren't the same Pixies of 1988 or 1990 or 1992. There are subtle differences, most notably in their vocals. Deal's voice has lost some of its whispery sweetness, and gained a coarser texture that roughens the edges of ""Gigantic"" and ""Ed Is Dead"". And Francis' voice has grown huskier, grittier, and lower, losing almost all of its nasal tone. Moreover, there's a different tension here than I remember from the band's heyday. They seem looser and less uptight, perhaps not as driven or as obscure, but seemingly having a much better time on stage. ""Debaser"" even has a little swing in it as Black sings about Un Chien Andalou. Ultimately, the Pixies sound different; they feel bigger now, more revered and appreciated. Maybe it's because they're playing larger venues for younger, enthusiastic crowds, or perhaps because they've been identified as the forebears of so much of today's indie rock, but they sound positively charged here. The downside to this resurgence is that it's difficult to think of the Pixies in the present tense. They're like classic rock now-- especially considering how little new material this reunion has spawned to date-- and Hey! finds them walking a thin timeline between embracing their legacy and fighting off the past tense. ","Download-only, band-selected set features 28 live tracks recorded on the group's wildly successful comeback tour.

The Greatest,Ian Brown,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e8c0084474cd0bfcae/1:1/w_160/53988656.jpg,2006-01-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/970-the-greatest/,Polydor,"My first experience with Ian Brown's solo output came in 1998, when his debut solo LP, Unfinished Monkey Business, was still somewhat fresh. I had a program on a small college station and tried to play the instrumental title track near the end of my show, but was forced to fade it out halfway through because it was too awful for words. Still, I was a Stone Roses maniac at the time and gave it another chance a week later, spinning ""Corpses in Their Mouths"" (in its entirety). Lyrics like ""She smokes crack/ It's off the beaten track"" notwithstanding, it was a pretty cool song, with a sort of slinky vibe, spaghetti Western guitars, and stylish production, and it somewhat restored my faith that perhaps one of the members of the Stone Roses might be capable of something great outside the band. Three Ian Brown albums later (discounting a remix disc), I'm still hesitant to refer to anything he's done as ""great,"" but he has managed a few choice tracks on each solo LP, and now some of the best are gathered in one place on The Greatest, a collection with a title that's presumably intended as a play on his reputation for arrogance (in his music if not his personal life). Also included are his two UNKLE guest spots, ""Be There"" and ""REIGN"", and obligatory new tracks, ""Return of the Fisherman"" and ""All Ablaze"". Everything is arranged chronologically, and even alternate or new versions of certain songs are slotted with tracks from the same album as the original recording. ""My Star"" isn't exactly the most auspicious opener, with its horrendous faux Indian music intro, tired NASA samples, and hokey lyrics about astronauts and ""space exploration,"" but the mellow detachment of ""Corpses in Their Mouths"" rights things quickly. The three Golden Greats cuts included are generally a cut above the material from the first album, especially the scientifically questionable ""Dolphins Were Monkeys"", which rides a funky, fuzzed-over Rhodes groove and employs busy production that makes it more difficult to understand what Brown is singing. ""Golden Gaze"" has the kind of fuzzy electro stomp you figure Led Zeppelin might have happened upon had they continued into the mid-90s. The mid-90s are what I most think of when listening to this disc, in fact. Even the material recorded well beyond the close of that decade, like the three tracks from 2004's Solarized, sound wedded to those years, and it's pretty remarkable how consistent the production style is from album to album. This collection works almost as though the songs were all recorded in a one or two-year span-- Solarized opener ""Longsight M13"", for instance, with its anthemic stomp, vaguely Eastern melody, and bleepy effects, sits comfortably next to the heavily phased electro-Britpop of ""Can't See Me"", a song six years its senior. The two UNKLE tracks stick out for their comparatively stark musical backings, but Brown's vocals, double-tracked as always, unite them with the other material easily. ""Be There"", a one-off single from 1999, comes across as too repetitive, but ""REIGN"", from UNKLE's unheralded second album Never, Never, Land, is pretty good, with a rough beat styled from some nice breaks and a well-chosen string sample. The song serves as a nice companion to Music of the Spheres opener ""F.E.A.R."", one of Brown's best solo tracks with its well-scored string arrangement and slow, churning beat. As the cherries on top, the new songs aren't terribly sweet. ""Return of the Fisherman"" is clumsy, stuffed with vocals that don't line up with the rhythm track and a chorus that rhymes ""king"" and ""sing"" over and over again, while ""All Ablaze"" is serviceable but hardly essential, closing the compilation with a bit of buzzy psychedelia overrun with wandering special-effects guitar. The Greatest is easily Brown's best solo release, as it should be, even if he doesn't always hit the mark.","Best-of collection from the uneven solo career of the former Stone Roses leader.

Rantology,Ministry,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5470c2bba1b7de01435/1:1/w_160/84840aca.jpg,2006-01-08 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5310-rantology/,Sanctuary,"In 1993, I tracked down a copy of the ""Burning Inside"" single from Ministry's masterpiece, 1989's The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste. The single boasted the 12"" remixes for both the title track and ""Thieves"", as well as a fantastic cover of Skinny Puppy's ""Smothered Hope"". I listened to the remixes over and over, trying to figure out how they were different than the originals. Beyond ""Thieves"" being slightly longer, I never found any significant difference between the remixes and the original album cuts. Rantology, Ministry's 25th anniversary collection, is a hodgepodge release that, besides being an album-length diatribe against the Bush administration, features one new song, three live Ministry classics, three recent album tracks, and eight remixes, and sadly it indicates that at this point in his career, Al Jourgensen still hasn't gotten a handle on the remix. At some point in their career, possibly when Paul Barker left, Ministry stopped being an industrial band and started being a boring thrash band. Album opener, ""No W (Redux)"", proves this within the first few guitar notes. The song, a rehash of ""N.W.O."" from 1992's Psalm 69, is essentially the same as the version that originally appeared on Fat Wreck Chords' Rock Against Bush comp. The President opens with the campaign standard, ""I'm George W. Bush, and I approve of this message,"" before the track launches into a cinematic clash of keyboard-strings, operatic vocals, and weak programmed drums. Eventually, Bush quotes some scripture and the song tears into run-of-the-mill open-E riffing accented by the occasional programmed horn and string burst, all of which here sound cheap and generic. ""No W (Redux)"" sets the tone for the remixes on this collection, which barely sound different than the originals. ""N.W.O. (Update mix)"" features new samples of the current Bush replacing many of the GHWB's quotes from the original, but nothing else appears different. ""Stigmata (Update mix)"" has been polished off to have a slicker, more artificial guitar tone that fits well with the band's apparent devotion to fake instruments, and the slightly altered vocal rhythm in the verses only brings the song down further. We also get ""updated"" or alternate mixes of four other tracks, including ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", all of which sound more or less the same as the originals. ""Unsung"" is the only track here that seems to have actually benefited from its alternate mix. Originally on 2003's barely listenable Animositisomina, this version has been beefed up with bagpipes and other added noise, and it actually features a melody in the verses instead of Jourgensen's incessant barking. The one new track here is ""The Great Satan"", which further spews venom towards the President with uninspired speed-metal riffing, flat, robotic drumming, and distorted vocals. ""Bloodlines"", which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the video game ""Vampires: The Bloodlines"", changes things up dramatically. The verses are built on a foundation of dub-like drums, a hypnotic bass, and low-mixed guitar squealing. Then the chorus rolls around, the guitar bursts in, and Jorgensen's deeper, clean vocals turn to a screech. Sound familiar? That's because it's a complete rehash of ""So What?"" from The Minds Is a Terrible Thing to Taste, minus Chris Connelly's seething vocals. If a band besides Ministry had recorded this song, they'd be getting sued for copyright infringement. The remainder of Rantology are older tracks either directly from the last two Ministry albums or in live form. For live tracks we get ""Thieves"", ""Psalm 69"", and ""The Fall"", all from 2002's Sphinctour. Rantology doesn't work as a greatest hits package, as it leaves out most of the band's best, not to mention most recognizable, tracks. Furthermore, it doesn't work as a remix album because the remixes are uninspired. Jourgensen helped introduce many people to industrial back in the early 90s, but on Rantology, the dark, unnerving tone of his earlier work has long since been traded in for the uninspired rantings of a cranky musician trying too hard regain his prominence.","Poorly executed and ultimately unnecessary odds'n'sods compilation from the industrial legends.

Candy Ass,Mark Eitzel,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1ac0084474cd0c29f3/1:1/w_160/f6cfb76f.jpg,2006-01-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2706-candy-ass/,Cooking Vinyl,"Though sometimes dismissed as a bald, ugly crusader of one-note mope, Mark Eitzel can be a bald, ugly bastion of hope-- his romantic ideals so pure in theory that the characters in his tales can't help but fall short. Yet, foiled by comatose backdrops and sagging intensity, his seventh solo venture acts as parody, falling prey to the sad sack stereotypes. After 2001's excellent, electro-acoustic hybrid The Invisible Man, Eitzel's muse seemed lost, following that record with a covers album and an LP of re-recordings of his own work. But when the singer reunited with his American Music Club mates in 2004, the move stirred his creative juices, resulting in the better-than-average ""we're back!"" disc, Love Songs For Patriots. So, with AMC mk. II still going strong, why another solo CD? As the singer recently told Magnet, ""I didn't intend to make Candy Ass...my management kind of forced me to release it. I was going to release it only on the Web. So I'm a candy ass for releasing the damn thing."" Known for his self-deprecation, the comment could plausibly be laughed off. Too bad the album's poky mix of snail-slow blip-ballads and insignificant, shimmering non-starters make the self-immolating sentiments ring true. Expounding on previous forays into Warp-y electronics, the record's four instrumentals underwhelm, coming across as wallpaper-ready mediocrity. Parts of an original film score, the pieces lack context here-- especially for an artist known for his stellar vocals and painstaking, dry lyricism. Making a Mark Eitzel song without his distinct croon is like casting Al Pacino as an extra in a movie-- pointlessly antithetical and silly. With few exceptions, the more traditional songs don't fare much better, with many feeling like dour Invisible Man leftovers. The best lyric comes courtesy of opener ""My Pet Rat St. Michael"", about a depressed rodent named after the superhero archangel John Travolta once embodied. ""He would hang himself except he already chewed threw his rope,"" quips the singer in a knowing near whisper. Spare and fierce-- the closing ""you got to fight for it"" refrain speaks to Eitzel's unlikely determination-- it's vintage, safe, and solid. But his typical outbursts of lung-popping passion are totally absent, replaced by a passive, sedate vocal delivery. Consequently, listless wisps like ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Homeland Pastoral"", and ""Roll Away My Stone"" casually float into alternative adult contemporary purgatory. In another bit from Magnet's Q&A;, Eitzel talks about the next AMC record, ""One song title is 'God I Miss You, You Fat Old Bitch'; it's about Santa Claus, written from the perspective of his boyfriend."" If that tidbit is indeed as true and on target as his Candy Ass derision, Eitzel's next act should have no problem blowing away this crushing bore of a detour.","Selections from a film score are oddly paired with more traditional singer/songwriter work on this solo record from the AMC leader.

Following in the footsteps of the Ramones, the band injects punk attitude into its stripped-down rock and notoriously over-the-top live performances. All of that is represented on 26-track, fan-selected, best-of Golden Black. Even the uninitiated have heard their sound before; distorted guitars playing three-chord punk while vocals are shouted over top. The recordings are strictly lo-fi affairs, and everything is pushed into the red (if you're speakers aren't crackling when Guitar Wolf is on, you're clearly not playing it loud enough). But don't mistake simple and old- fashioned for boring and unremarkable. From the moment singer/guitarist Seije ignites this collection with a characteristic ""one two three four!"" at the beginning of ""Can- nana Fever"", from 1999's Jet Generation, it's clear that these three guys are masters of the straightforward punk song. Tracks such as ""Red ""Wild Zero"", ""Missile Me"", ""Sky Star Jet"", and ""UFO Romantics"" beg for a sing-along, and if your Japanese isn't quite up to the task, the booklet offers lyrics translated into English. There are plenty of hooks buried in the layers of fuzz and grime, and the band creates riffs and tunes that sound familiar even on first listen. Those valuing innovation in their music may find Guitar Wolf a littl derivative, and I must admit that an American band attempting to pull off these songs would probably fall flat. At well over an hour long, causal listeners may get lost by the end, as the 26 songs on this disc tend to blend together after a while. This style of rock music sounds best in small bursts, though, and even if there is fault to be found in the generic quality of the songs, the B-grade sci-fi craziness surrounding it all adds a nice layer of charm. The most well-known of the mid-90s Japanese garage punk invasion, Guitar Wolf owe a great deal of their notoriety to their refusal to give up. Long after their counterparts-- Teengenerate, 5, 6, 7, 8's, etc.-- stopped putting out records, Guitar Wolf remain a vital force in the underground garage rock scene. The death of bassist Billy (born Hideaki Sekiguchi) in March of 2005 marks the end of an era for the band, and although the two remaining members are continuing their assault with new bassist Ug in tow, Golden Black presents a quality overview of their career up to this point.","Narnack issues a 26-track collection of the best from the 50s rock'n'roll- and punk-obsessed Japanese band.

Trojan Dub Rarities,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85fb1335d7bf169927f/1:1/w_160/89d2aaa3.jpg,2006-01-08 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2108-trojan-dub-rarities/,Trojan,"In case you glossed over the title: If this is the first time you've cuffed your pants to dip a toe into the waters of dub, this might not be the record for you. At 50 songs and three discs, Trojan Dub Rarities is an embarrassment of riches. It's also dense as hell. Anything that says ""rarities"" in the title is probably not for the first timer, the casual fan, the curious dilettante. For anyone born after 1975, especially the average Pitchfork reader (and writer), hearing dub for the first time can be disorienting. Dub has been absorbed into popular music in so many ways that have little to do with the Jamaican music of the '70s that bears the same name-- German techno, Fugazi basslines, overblown echo on shoegaze remixes. The first true dub record I bought (a King Tubby collection on Blood & Fire) left me with a bizarrely redundant revelation: hey, this is reggae. Psychedelically saturated and studio-addled reggae, yes. Everything I had been told about dub was true: Here was the alpha and the omega of all the production wizardry that followed. But it still sounded like, you know, reggae. A month or so later I got the Arkology box, a set of Lee Perry's Island-era recordings, and was definitely Hooked on Dub. But it was even more song-based than Tubby. What gives? A Simon Reynolds article in The Wire later that year conveniently articulated a lot of what I had been wondering after my initial dub experiences. Reynolds argued that, in the '90s, all the instrumental, studio, and electronic music (jungle, Basic Channel, all that ""macro dub infection"" stuff that seems as cutely dated to the '90s as grunge now) that picked up from dub left out a few important facts. Like that dubs were versions of singers singing popular songs. (Such as the gorgeous ""Daughter Dub"" on Dub Rarities by the silken-throated Cornell Campbell.) Or that dub was religious and political music. (Both of which are all over Dub Rarities, quoting ital dietary laws and bigging up Marcus Garvey.) So if you don't have something of an interest in reggae, dub may not be for you. But let's say you do, or you're at least curious enough to have read this far. Should you pick up Trojan Dub Rarities? Yes and no. Yes, because it contains music like a shimmering version of the ""Police and Thieves"" rhythm (""Babylon Police Thief Dub"" by Perry and Augustus Pablo) that saturates the jolly skank of the original with gold dust. Or the stern sermonizing of ""Revolution Version"" by Tapper Zukie and the Musical Intimidators, an island cousin to the Last Poets' ""Niggers Are Scared of Revolution"". And then there are the one-off oddities that can delight even seasoned dub-watchers, like the Observers' ""Iron Fist,"" which sounds wholly synthesized, coming off like Aphex circa I Care Because You Do or the queer, sour vignettes on the Vitalic album. No, because as I said before, it's all a bit much. One thing people seem afraid to say is that a lot of dub sounds, well, same-y. Given the voraciousness of the day-to-day 45 consumer in 1970s Jamaica, with each single coming with a dub version on the B-side, there was a lot of rhythm and effects recycling going on. Not all of these Rarities are mind-blowing finds from the vault. Spread across the 50 tracks there are any number of perfunctory gallumphing rhythms and liberally applied echoplex. Calling something ""Tedious Dub"" might be an easy opening for a joke, but... Anyway, if you're enough of a dub fanatic to want this, you don't really need my recommendation or my jackleg history lesson. Like all of Trojan's 3xCD mini box sets, Dub Rarities retails for something like two sawbucks, which is beyond reasonable even with the padding. If you're a virgin, dub is one of those genres where you can't go wrong picking up one of the established classics of the genre as your first--seek out Augustus Pablo's King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown or Perry's Super Ape or Tubby's Dub Like Crazy. And if you like what you hear, you're in for a treat, because suddenly there's a whole world of echo to explore.","3xCD set features work by the Upsetters, Augustus Pablo, and Tapper Zukie, among others.

First Comes First,The Paddingtons,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1aaea9e61561daa4861/1:1/w_160/397d672b.jpg,2006-01-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6590-first-comes-first/,Vertigo,"Their debut's more than a potential premature-ejac joke, but not only was the Paddingtons' combat pub-rawk done better by the London-callers their album cover aesthetic emulates, it was redone OK in the 1990s, too. The Paddingtons take those models and also draw from punk's streamlined late-'90s MTV hangover. Recent single ""Sorry"" spryly concocts a Strokes-182 with its slurred vocal, chiming downstroked distortion, and adolescent banality: ""Sorry, hope you're feeling happy now/ Hope you're feeling happy now/ I am gone."" There's even the swaying, melodramatic bridge of a prototypical pop-punk anthem. Repetitive emo jawn ""Worse for Wear"" and urgent, embittered opener ""Some Old Girl"" likewise summon 41 or so greener days. Producer Owen Morris, yep from (What's the Story) Morning Glory, is likely a big reason the British press has breezed over such comparisons. He leaves the Paddingtons' recordings with ragged, live-sounding warmth, as opposed to the blocky hamfisting of much U.S. radio punk. Singer Tom Atkin's undeniable Englishness, from off-key burr to would-be rebel yell, is another factor. It's probably not a coincidence the album's most noteworthy song is ""50 to a £"", a burst of hooky heartbreak as British as the Buzzcocks. The song is also decidedly anti-drug (Atkin scolds an ex-lover, ""And when you're comin' down...""), pitting the Pads lads as counterpart to Pete Doherty's eve of self-destruction. For good measure, dark teeth-rattling back-and-forth ""Panic Attack"" finds Atkin rasping, ""You wanna die? Go on, keep committing suicide."" Not quite ""STAY OFF THE CRACK,"" but London ain't burning and these guys are straight, hippy Johnny. Then ""Stop Breathing"" unfortunately eschews Pavement-coverage for half-baked homicidal urges, ""Alright in the Morning"" skanks through Brixton hands on empty head, and rambunctious 2004 single ""21"" dervishes about and breaks things. As for the title track, alas, it stops far short of explaining First Comes First. Over stomping rhythms and a handful of emo-anguished power chords, Atkins spits a few violent images and then preaches chorus truth: ""This is my way, what is my way, in my, my/ This is my way, what is my way, in my mind."" And I thought I was already spent three paragraphs ago.","Owen Morris-produced Brit band sound like, you guessed it, mid-90s UK guitar rock.

Forest,Circle,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d89d034d5c69bf33c5/1:1/w_160/cf78c6a2.jpg,2006-01-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1476-forest/,No Quarter,"First off, foreign is foreign; might as well say it, and suggest that it helps explain why after so many records and so many record reviews no one's yet pinned Circle to the wall. My guess: there's more need for a Finnish translator than any self-respecting pair of knowledgeable American ears might want to admit. I know only this much: a bongo in Finland is still a bongo in any speaker, and no country can redeem that awful sound. Proggy metal riffed on keyboards and organs coupled with Mika Ratto's operatic vocals are both hilarious and oddly galvanizing, but that's the province of some other Circle record or live show. Forest is a flat-out, albeit dark dark dark, longhaired hippy record. So expect the entire fifth grade music room arsenal: aforementioned bongos, triangle percussion, xylophoned melody lines, shaky shakers, and on-and-off synch chorale humming. Also get the volume knob handy, since most of Forest registers only at a whisper that, once cranked, forms a windy, mumbling, sleep-talked monologue. Norm deviations, in songs that go with one part for more minutes than can be believed, become big moments. The gruff grindcore/cookie monster vocals of ""Luikertelevat"", sparse and back-loaded though they are, relieve an almost painfully tight and repetitive acoustic guitar progression that otherwise shows no signs of stopping. And acid trips have been shorter than ""Jaljet"", which shoots air and little vocal cut-ins across various sensitive mics, then picks up for the mid-tempo, toasting session stuff that Circle attempts to sell all over Forest. Ratto seems as if he's making it up as he goes, probably ditto for the squeaky one-note interruptions and general drum-circled aural politics: Forest is, for better or worse, way beyond free. Whether someone without a lot of time on their hands, or a lot of drugs on their hands, will enjoy minimalist throat-singing and turn of the last century percussion (minus the big pieces), all with the mute button on, well, call it an open question. Certainly Forest is not self-conscious. The absence of any apparent expectation of an audience is rare and also somewhat exciting; however, when the thrill tapers off, the confusion sets in. Best is the taunt thriller ""Ydinaukio"", which presents as an incomprehensible melodrama: ""When I first met you/ Having eyes like sparks/ Having eyes like stars/ So I told myself/What do we have here?"" Lacking a lyric sheet, or articulated syllables, the narrative's guesswork even when you want in. If you don't, it's easy enough, with Forest's solipsism, to walk away.","Proggy metal riffed on keyboards and organs and operatic vocals color this Finnish band's latest release.

The Logic of Building the Body Plan EP,Bound Stems,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4aaea9e61561daa4f69/1:1/w_160/31054505.jpg,2006-01-05 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1191-the-logic-of-building-the-body-plan-ep/,Flameshovel,"When I first caught the Bound Stems in concert, they sounded like an economical take on math-rock-- winding guitars and tricky time signatures, but with pop songs I could still remember after stumbling home. That was nearly two years ago, when they had only a couple self-released EPs to their name. I saw them perform again recently and they'd drafted Janie Porche to sing near-constant backup and play about 18 different instruments, in the process becoming a many-legged amorphous blob of swiftly-changing styles, sometimes three or four times per song. Unfortunately, Porche doesn't appear on The Logic of Building the Body Plan, a generous seven-track EP, nor does she play on the band's first full-length that's already completed but yet to be released. So it's strange that Bound Stems' first release with real distribution is a transitional one, recorded after their album was finished. Bound Stems take cues from meat'n'potatoes indie here, but take substantial risks with composition, and the songs are just as likely to run aground as succeed. The lovely collage art in the booklet that overbears the nearly illegible lyric sheet couldn't be more evocative of the music therein-- several thrilling moments, but with a few songs just short of a payoff or a thread to hold onto. The band recalls a lot of well-established names here: Bobby Gallivan's double-tracked vocals and wistful, rolling syllables recall Issac Brock's delivery in calmer moments, the best tracks lean on woozy crescendos á la Arcade Fire, and the band switches gears as unexpectedly as Fiery Furnaces (there's even two spoken-word elderly woman interludes). But their ambitious and hungry guitar/bass/keyboards/loops line-up is more jagged and distorted than any of those acts. It's an immersive listen, but not always a cohesive one. Opener ""Crimes & Follies"" builds from a slow, syncopated strum into a heavy swing just to toss its momentum to the wind with a meandering instrumental passage, and the many segments of tracks like ""Totipotent"" and ""My Kingdom for a Trundle Bed""-- with jangling guitars, bubbling electronic textures, reverberating keyboards, and deep distorted basslines-- collide less than gracefully. There's two big exceptions, though: ""Wake Up, Ma and Pa Are Gone"" breezes past on gorgeous guitars and a sprightly drum pattern (courtesy of Harvey Danger refugee Evan Sult), almost slows to a halt, then pulls up for a speaker-blowing crescendo. Then there's ""Risking Life and Limb for the Coupon"", where Gallivan stays calm while the rhythm leaps and lurches until the cathartic full-band sigh of the finale with memorable calm/frantic call-and-response singing. (Incidentally, both of these tracks are taken from their unreleased full-length.) Bound Stems may be guilty of showing all their cards at once and rarely relaxing for the sake of the song, but its worth it to catch them now-- before they become another entirely different band.","Generous seven-track EP from the quickly developing indie rock band.

The Naïve Shaman,Richard Youngs,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae1c0084474cd0c1290/1:1/w_160/1da848c0.gif,2006-01-05 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8844-the-naive-shaman/,Jagjaguwar,"Glaswegian free music maverick Richard Youngs has been on a feverish tear of late, collaborating with fellow outsiders Makato Kawabata, Alex Neilson, Matthew Bower, and Jandek in addition to a stream of solo releases. The Naïve Shaman is the seventh Youngs solo album to be released on Jagjaguwar, and like its predecessors it is truly a one-man affair, with no contributions from any supporting musicians. Beyond this essential solitude, however, Youngs' albums can be so dissimilar from one another as to seem of completely different species, as he continues his diligent, egoless quest for new avenues into the outer realms of the spirit. Assembled entirely on his home computer, The Naïve Shaman represents Youngs' first extensive foray into digital recording. On these five tracks, his distinctive psychedelic mantras are heavily fortified by deep, resonant electric bass tones and encircling, multi-layered vocals. As a result, the album possesses a thick, enveloping warmth that signals a dramatic departure from both the ravaged isolation of 2004's River Through Howling Sky as well as the more folk-oriented material of earlier works like 2002's May. And though its bold creation makes The Naïve Shaman one of Youngs' most adventurously experimental releases, its supple melodic figures also make it quite likely his most approachable. In fact, the tranquil waves of album opener ""Life on a Beam"" are initially so temperate and sonorous that my wife rather inexplicably mistook it for a Sting track-- a comparison I'm still not entirely sure what to do with. Fortunately, things get decidedly more shamanic on the 10-minute centerpiece ""Sonar In My Soul"", which matches a repetitive, spiraling vocal melody to a burbling bass throb, dub-like electronic effects, and caustic guitar interjections. As with so many of Youngs' best minimalist recitations, this piece achieves an organic sense of constant renewal, perpetually gathering momentum until its roots have secured a permanent anchor in the memory. Following the brief, folk-like echo of ""Once It Was Autumn"", Youngs promptly cycles the seasons for the monumental closer ""Summer's Edge II"", a blurred epic on which he abandons himself entirely to his disorienting solstice hymn. Over a dense hive of treated guitar drones and distant, free-form percussion, Youngs obliquely submits his services to the universe, ""Doors are turning/ sing through me, sing through me."" And as the The Naïve Shaman drifts to a close with the hypnotically repeated two-word processional ""Summer's edge, summer's edge,"" Youngs' fearless intensity might immediately prompt his faithful pilgrims to build eager anticipation for his next singularly inspired liturgy.","Latest Jagjaguwar release from the prolific Glaswegian free music maverick.

The Slider / Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow / Dandy in the Underworld / The T. Rex Wax Co. Singles: A's and B's 1972-77,T. Rex,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70bc0084474cd0c0adb/1:1/w_160/4f83729a.jpg,2006-01-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11845-the-slider-zinc-alloy-and-the-hidden-riders-of-tomorrow-dandy-in-the-underworld-the-t-rex-wax-co-singles-as-and-bs-1972-77/,Wizard,"""Mwa-AAAA-aaaaa-Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Yeahhhh!"" That's how Marc Bolan kicks off The Slider, T. Rex's follow-up to the career-making Electric Warrior, which brought the band out of the folk circuit and onto the rock stage. That lead track, ""Metal Guru"", belongs in the pantheon of great rock album openers: It's a rapturous two-and-a-half minutes, a joyous celebration of itself. Amazingly, The Slider doesn't let up after that, but sustains its high across 13 boogie-bound tracks, each punctuated by Bolan's enthusiastic ""yeah!""'s and ""woo!""'s. He even starts ""Baby Strange"" with what might be the silliest count-off ever. At the peak of his rock superstardom, Bolan was also at the top of his game, and The Slider is his ecstatic ode both to himself and to music in general. The 50s rock rhythms that threatened to burst the seams of Electric Warrior here explode mightily and repeatedly. Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Elvis Presley loom large, but Bolan throws some glitter and make-up into the mix and comes up with something both familiar and new. Meanwhile, the band-- percussionist Mickey Finn, Steve Currie on bass, and Bill Legend on drums, plus producer Tony Visconti-- lock in on the grooves that propel ""Buick McKane"", ""Baby Strange"", and ""Chariot Choogle"". In a glam-jive code that combines Dylanesque wordplay with psychedelic imagery, Bolan writes about himself and his coterie, filling songs with shout-outs to hangers-on he nicknames Telegram Sam (allegedly his supplier during the recording sessions), Golden Nose Slim, Jo Jo, and Buick McKane, as well as to Dylan, Alan Freed, and Max's Kansas City. As such, The Slider reveals a lot about the man behind the glitter-- not through outright confessional songwriting, but via personal peccadilloes like, ""And when I'm sad... I slide!"" It's Bolan locating the perfect stance from which he can say nothing and everything at once. Of course, neither the celebrity nor the music lasted. For one thing, Bolan was quickly outdone by the pomp of David Bowie and other glam androgynes, and left behind when his cultural moment passed. For another, his gift for excess, while previously a boon to his songwriting, was a bane when it came to drugs. When his star began to fade, so did his music. These four reissues from Rhino, which are essentially identical to the Edsel reissues from a few years ago, track T. Rex's downward trajectory but attempt to redeem the band's later, lesser releases by packaging each album with a bonus disc that re-creates the tracklist using alternate takes, live tracks, and B-sides. On Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, the second disc actually outshines the original album, presenting looser, funkier, less worked-over versions of those clunky songs. Released after Tanx (which will be reissued later this month, alongside two other albums and a collection of unfinished songs), Zinc Alloy flails desperately as Bolan tries to incorporate his new fascination with American funk into the T. Rex sound. Unfortunately, these elements only make the songs sound as leaden as their titles suggest. On ""Galaxy"" and ""Sound Pit"" he alludes to past hits ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"", ""Metal Guru"", and ""Telegram Sam"", but here his self-mythologizing sounds jaded, as if he needs to remind listeners of past glories to justify his current excesses. ""Carsmile Smith and the Old One"", ""Painless Persuasion v. the Meathawk Immaculate"", and ""The Leopards Featuring Gardenia and the Mighty Slug"" all sink under the weight of bulky concepts and awkward grooves, and the prominent backing vocals by Bolan's American girlfriend, soul singer Gloria Jones, ratchet up the theatrical bombast to gaudy heights. Change, as the bonus disc is retitled, strips away most of the orchestral overkill, but the songs still sound empty, their joy curdling into bitterness. Originally released three years later (with two other albums in between), Dandy in the Underworld recaptures Bolan's former spiritedness, as he imagines himself cast out from the realm of stardom. On the title track, he's Orpheus traveling through a hell of popular indifference. ""When will he come up for air? Will anybody ever care?"" Bolan asks on the chorus, but instead of whining, he seems genuinely hurt by the betrayal of his errant muse. Oddly enough, the album finds a reinvigorated Bolan crafting some of his best hooks and calibrating his catchiest grooves in years. The cosmic ""Crimson Moon"", the infectious ""I'm a Fool for You Girl"", and the album's centerpiece, ""Jason B. Sad"", alternate between carefree and cautious, conjuring a gravity that counterbalances the upbeat, stripped-down rhythms. The album trails off near the end-- especially with Bolan's hammy Elvis impersonation on ""Pain and Love""-- but ""Teenage Riot Structure"" picks up the Orpheus thread again, with lyrics that intimate his fears, doubts, and hopes. The album's most noteworthy flaw, perhaps, is that it sounds best in context with the other albums; only to a degree does Dandy stand on its own, but it accrues additional force as the final chapter in Bolan's ongoing story of Marc Bolan. That mythology further unfolds on The T. Rex Wax Co. Singles: A's and B's 1972-1977, which collects the singles Bolan released between albums. He often released songs as singles long after they'd already appeared on albums, and as a result, there's no strict chronology to the tracklist. ""Baby Boomerang"", for example, appeared as an A-side nearly five years after it was originally released on The Slider. Plus, all of these songs appear either as regular or bonus tracks (some in multiple versions) on the Rhino album reissues, so this 2xCD set sounds like an abridged edition of the series rather than an career overview. Still, it's amazing that singles like ""Children of the Revolution"", the mighty ""20th Century Boy"", and the giddy ""Celebrate Summer"" never made it onto any of the band's original albums-- omissions that reveal the depth of T. Rex's catalog as well as its sturdiness 30 years on. ",,9.8,
OHM+: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music: 1948-1980,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85d5e6ef959693211be/1:1/w_160/ae771534.jpeg,2006-01-05 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2106-ohm-the-early-gurus-of-electronic-music-1948-1980/,Ellipsis ArtsEllipsis Arts,"I was leafing through Scientific American the other day at the library-- don't laugh, my alternative was the ""beer barn"" in the liquor store parking lot-- and noticed an article by noted artificial intelligence guru Ray Kurzweil. Actually, it was a thinly veiled plug for his new book on ""the singularity,"" or the coming of an age when we will all be connected to each other via electronic networks, and little microscopic robots will help turn us into super people. Once I got over the ""Star Trek""-ness of it, it started to seem less science fiction and more black comedy. To think that in only about 75 years we've gone from the idea that computers might be useful for some simple calculations to planning to use them to turn us into what our ancestors would have considered gods is both amazing and disturbing. Kurzweil's ""law of accelerating returns"" is indeed impressive, and when you think at all the good that might come of leaps in both technology and human evolution, the future looks pretty bright. That is, if we're still actually human. Music has been affected no less drastically. As Brian Eno points out in his forward to the recently reissued and expanded OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music 3xCD box set (now with the addition of a DVD, and re-dubbed OHM+), most of what we listen to is electronic in some fashion, contrary to the entire history of music prior to the 1920s. Whether over the radio, stereo, or amplified speaker, electronic music has all but made ""natural"" sound obsolete. And of course, this says nothing about the musicians who actually use electronics as instruments, manipulating digits, circuits, and bits to make music-- music that, for all intents and purposes, would have been as unimaginable as Martian rovers to your grandparents. Lucky for us, three generations into the technological revolution, much of the shock of innovation has given way to something of a learned instinct when it comes to this stuff. The groundbreaking experiments of composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Schaefer, Pierre Henry, and John Cage have led to an age where blips and beeps are not only taken for granted but form the basis of a musical education that for most people starts in pre-school with such ""advanced"" learning tools as Simon Says. OHM+, covering electronic music from the 1930s to the 1980s, documents a clear and steady path towards an age when most music simply couldn't be made without electronic assistance. The characters involved were undoubtedly experimenters working on the edges of both technology and good old human ingenuity. In many cases, their results will sound strange to ears accustomed to more refined uses of the available tools-- but in others, the sounds are eerily ahead of their time. Regardless, OHM+ is one of the best documents of its kind, and a model for archival compilations. OHM+'s first disc contains music from the earliest days of recorded electronic music, and as much as you might expect it to contain barely controlled squeaks and static, there are moments of surreal beauty. Olivier Messiaen, though hardly known as a preeminent electronic music composer, did use the ondes martenot (a keyboard using a ribbon and ring to change pitch) on ""Oraison"" from 1937. The melody (borrowed from his own ""Louange a l'eternite de Jesus"") is perfectly suited to the keyboard's theremin-like portamento (a technique of gliding smoothly from one note to another). Likewise, Clara Rockmore's performance of Tchaikovsky's Valse Sentimentale on theremin transcends gimmick, sounding like an alluring, retro-futuristic serenade. Of course, there is plenty of the hard stuff: check the animated audience reaction to Cage's revolutionary tape-edit piece Williams Mix from 1952, or Tod Dockstader's creepy sound collage ""Apocalypse II"" from 1961. Stockhausen predates both surround sound and Zaireeka with his four-channel Kontakte, while Edgard Varese's ""Poem Electronique"", using seemingly random snippets of found-sound and ancient synthesizer squeaks, is actually one of the great early examples of mastering electronic music bit by bit. And if you're left wanting some good old fashioned humanity, Milton Babbit's Philomel excerpt, a duet of sorts featuring synthesizer and female soprano, forecasts just how integrated electronics would become with live performance. Disc 2 picks up in 1959 with Raymond Scott's fairly amazing ""Cindy Electronium"", composed on a synthesizer Scott invented and sounding a lot like something you'd hear on a Mouse on Mars record. Seriously, someone needs to organize a Raymond Scott remix album stat. As it happens, Pauline Oliveros' psychedelic masterpiece ""Bye Bye Butterfly"" predicts the remix, using bits of old opera and state-of-the-60s delay to concoct a piece of prime haze fit to tie all of Brooklyn's hip noisemakers up on a very tall pole. In fact, there's a lot on this disc to feed the avant-rock crew: Can's Holger Czukay delivers the sample collage ""Boat-Woman-Song"" from his 1969 Canaxis LP, Terry Riley gets his freak on with ""Poppy Nogood"" and in some bizarre, out-of-time programming, the OHM+ folks use Sonic Youth's 1999 performance of Steve Reich's ""Pendulum Music"" (originally composed in 1968). Elsewhere, electronic music legends Morton Subotnick (""Silver Apples on the Moon, pt. 1""), Luc Ferrari (""Music Promenade""), and Iannis Xenakis (""Hibiki-Hana-Ma"") demonstrate that you don't have to have ties to rock music to make head-fucked noize. The disc ends with Minimalist pioneer La Monte Young's precisely titled ""31 I 60 c. 12:17:33-12:25:33 PM NYC"" from 1969, a dissonant sine wave drone-- ordinarily, this would clear the room, but in light of what came before, it's practically a come-down*.* By Disc 3, electronic music's exponential rate of progress is evident. From the otherworldly, digitally harmonized vocals of Paul Lansky's ""Six Fantasies on A Poem By Thomas Campion: Her Song"" (which he programmed partially in the FORTRAN computer language) to Krautrock pioneer Klaus Schulze's ornery, beat-driven ""Melange"" to the massive, droney void in Maryanne Amacher's ""Living Sound, Patent Pending"", it's clear that by the late 1970s, composers were breaking down sonic barriers by the day. Growing out of the painstaking mold of punch cards and handmade circuitry, these musicians took one step closer to modern electronic production methods of sonic manipulation and construction. Ironically, they were also becoming masters of the acoustic, as in Alvin Lucier's ingenious use of the tension in a single wire (""Music On A Long Thin Wire 1"" or Robert Ashley's collage of human voices on ""Automatic Writing"". Of course, Brian Eno's ethereal ""Unfamiliar Wind (Leeks Hills)"" forecasts modern electronic music most directly-- but then some would argue no one's yet improved on his ambient excursions. The accompanying DVD has enough archival performance footage (performances by Morton Subotnick, Laurie Spiegel, Alvin Lucier, Pauline Oliveros, Mother Mallard, and Holger Czukay) to make it worthwhile for fans, but the real joy is in the interviews and original video productions. Milton Babbit's discussion of the difficulties of working with archaic synthesizers in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the 1950s and 60s is a firm reminder of just how foreign electronic sounds were to even the academic community only 40 years ago. Likewise, Paul Lansky's private lesson with theremin inventor Leon Theremin is an example of how non-user friendly electronic musical instruments could be, even to people who should have the best sense of how to approach them. And speaking of Lansky, someone really needs to issue a DVD of all the animations accompanying his pieces, because his The Dust Bunny features a great computer-generated cartoon that's one part Pixar, one part ""Ren & Stimpy"". Even after 70 years of innovation (and renovation), electronic music still manages to surprise.","Recently reissued and expanded 3xCD set-- now with the addition of a DVD-- collects three generations worth of electronic music landmarks.

High School Reunion: A Tribute to Those Great 80s Films,Various Artists,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83b5e6ef9596932116c/1:1/w_160/46021dd3.gif,2006-01-04 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2073-high-school-reunion-a-tribute-to-those-great-80s-films/,American LaundromatFace Down,"Even a decade-and-a-half after its closure, 1980s pop music's totem in rock history remains a work in progress. Harsh skepticism of it in the early 90s almost instantaneously dismissed 10 years worth of relatively superficial, tacky music. As if to further discredit the decade, VH1 and MTV relegated 80s videos to novelty programs like ""Pop-Up Video"", keeping their bread-and-butter programs free of the nostalgic muck. Hell, even Comedy Central began running reasonably earnest 80s movies as comedies. Try as they may though, the 80s weren't going away, not in 1994, and certainly not in the 21st century. While The Wedding Singer and ""I Love the 80s"" helped to extricate irony from the revival, the infiltration of bands like the Killers into the mainstream exposed today's audiences as more receptive to the decade than they could've imagined. Case in point, the Bravery foisted the most egregious fake-Cure album ever on the public, and many bought it. Further wrinkling this reification crisis, High School Reunion tickles our sentimental bone in addition to simple nostalgia; these aren't just pop hits, they're soundtracks to the movies that (aesthetic quality aside) firmly embedded themselves in our hearts. Needless to say, High School Reunion runs some huge risks. For one, the tribute is somewhat self-serving, featuring mainly artists who peaked during the 80s rather than newer, flashier groups paying their dues to their influences-- in other words, if you wanted to bridge the generational gap here, look elsewhere. On the other hand, Matthew Sweet immaculately mimicking Tom Petty on ""American Girl"" begs the question, is there a non-masturbatory purpose to carbon-copying the songs you love? After all, the whole effect is totally lost when an unknown like the Wading Girl basically karaokes over the backing music to ""Danke Schoen"", then tries to play it cool with an electric guitar solo. For all the potential heartstring tugging, the disc's bright spots occur on the quirkier, fun covers. Rather than trying to spruce up Oingo Boingo, the Bennies embrace Danny Elfman's kooky songwriting on ""Weird Science"". Frank Black one-ups that by simultaneously giving Iggy Pop a shout-out while sounding perfectly form-fitted to the sci-fi tomfoolery of ""Repo Man"", Trompe Le Monde's biological father. 4AD incest aside, even Kristin Hersh's pirated ""Wave of Mutilation"" cover hits the spot despite the Pixies perfecting the song's slow version 15 years ago. But what of the tear-jerking, credit-closing show-stoppers we blared from a boombox held above our heads? Sadly, no one's getting lucky with those covers. AM gets fish in a barrel with ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", yet what begins as a promising Clinic version of the song degenerates into the Black Crowes singing what sounds like a Black Crowes song. While hardly as damning, Lori McKenna's snoozer of a cover, ""In Your Eyes"", actually sounds like an adult contemporary version of the song. Real question is, how much better could these songs really be in the first place? Maybe it's my preset emotional neurons talking here, but anything passed the original feels anticlimactic and just too after-the-fact. Not saying High School Reunion's a terrible idea, just feels too much like an actual high school reunion-- everyone's uglier and more boring than they were all those years ago.","Subtitled ""A Tribute to Those Great 80s Films"" this release features Frank Black, Kristin Hersh, Matthew Sweet, and more covering tracks from two-decades-old teen flicks.

Swamp Tech,Quintron and Miss Pussycat,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b5b1335d7bf1698314/1:1/w_160/3ab14bee.jpg,2006-01-04 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6600-swamp-tech/,Tigerbeat6,"Music critics, place your hands over your hearts and join me in this pledge: We shall not exploit the cataclysmic flooding of New Orleans to attach a pat resonance to the new Quintron & Miss Pussycat album. Although casting around a little, I see that some of us already have. Needlessly, too-- there are plenty of sensible things to say about Quintron's latest without attaching some risen-from-the-ashes narrative to it. We could talk about how Swamp Tech is, upon close examination, utterly befuddling-- an adjective-busting blend of electroclash 'tude, the White Stripes's reconstructed authenticity, X's skull-piercing organs, LCD thump, Electric 6's heavy-handed satire, the Frogs's transgressive mugging, Le Tigre's rave-along skate rink jams, gospel conviction and N'awlins bayou boogie, circuit-bent acid house squelch, et al. But at a reasonable distance, the album's mechanics are much simpler-- nasty, chicken-fried electro grooves squirm and squiggle through a pep rally of stupid/funny chant-alongs. By now Quintron's done with the disjunctive, percussion-heavy gear tests that informed his earlier albums; no longer needing to push the limits of his invented light-triggered percussion, he's focusing on playing polished, energetically affable songs. Dumb fun trumps brainy tedium, and if Swamp Tech were an RPG, it'd be all whimsical mini-games, no arduous stat-building. Sometimes, the lyrical absurdity approaches zen-koan levels of sublimity, as on the nervous metallic jangle of the brief ""Squirrel Gardens"": ""Squirrel Gardens is full of squirrels,"" deadpans Miss Pussycat. ""But there is someone who does not belong there who is there/ It is an eel that dresses like a squirrel."" That shit is pretty heavy. But mostly, we get exuberant brattiness. ""I am a badass,"" Quintron and Pussycat call-and-response over the gristly pulse of ""Swamp Buggy Badass"", right after what sounds like a bong hit starting like a lawn mower. The lunging organ vamp ""French Quarter Faggot"" finds Quintron in self-lacerating mode: ""I am a French Quarter faggot motherfucker/ I like the sound of electroclash,"" his voice dropping into an appropriately ghoulish lower register on the last word. ""Fly Like a Rat"" appropriates ""The Jeffersons"" theme into its splashy electro muskrat love, and ""Witch in the Club"" is an electrified dance floor with soaring organ shunts. It's raw, raucous and gyroscopic, recorded live to two-track with Quintron running his organ through a bass cabinet for that fat-bottomed, buzzing sound. Swamp Tech is strictly party-and-bullshit, if the modified-for-organ cover of Kiss's ""God of Thunder"" didn't already tip you off.","NOLA duo blends electroclash, heavy-handed satire, skate-rink jams, and White Stripes-like rock.

Truth Becomes Death,Nadja,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98ceb335119a49ec7e3/1:1/w_160/316a02c0.jpg,2006-01-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5924-truth-becomes-death/,Alien8,"The hallmarks of newest-wave rock and roll aren't shaping up to be very punk. Earth-long drones, Mogwai builds, previously unheard of portions of Japanoise ear-bleed; there are fewer three minute songs, and, even when loud, tracks seem less confrontational. The double-edged sword of the new avant garde: more patient audiences, more bands taking license. On this contested ground, Toronto two piece Nadja drop Truth Becomes Death. Heavy and abstract, Nadja plow the increasingly popular territory being laid out between slow metal and staticy ambiance. Alien8's first real venture into the far side of the art-rock metal divide, the move would perhaps be more significant if the gap wasn't already shrinking so rapidly. Without being shockingly original, Nadja's sound is the apotheosis of a long convergence and (welcome) genre bleed. Though timely, Truth Becomes Death risks being a marginal record, if only because it has a nature so huge some might take it as scenery. Archaeological in the same way a many times dubbed-over tape is, Nadja move their source material way back in mix and let fuzz and a sea of glowing noise ride shotgun along with the instruments. The resulting environment has a giant resonance. Drum (machine) sound is triply huge on ""Bug/Golem""; not only is the recording so big it sounds as if they expanded the room to accommodate it, but stray elements echo the percussion on every rock solid hit. The song incorporates lo-fi 90s cassette aesthetics and 80s guitar breakdowns and assigns both new meanings: a Youth of Today macho bullshit chug-chug-chug is turned into epic, arty song punctuation. In this barbarously delicate sea, the crashing guitars and horror house vocals of ""Memory Leak"" wreck damage in some other nearby room. Spooky synth guitar solos only add to the distance; the aggro stuff is so diluted it becomes panoramic. Part of the charm of the old slow-core, big riffs pseudo-metal was that it shot a pure dose, but so did the ultra-fast grind of the Locust or Discordance Axis; once the gimmick is over, it's over. Nadja's not obsessed or stuck on ideologies, which is why they sound like latecomers. But as they put it on ""Breakpoint"", ""the infestation breaks loose, spreads, and at some point takes over\xD1bacteria grows on my circuits and I learn how to feel."" So they take the old grinding sonic palette of indecipherable and ripping vocals over thundering guitars, rot it, and stick its head underwater. Then they learn how to sing with their lungs submerged.","Heavy and abstract, this Alien8 band plows the increasingly popular territory between slow metal and staticy ambiance.

The Weed Tree EP,Espers,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bceb5e6ef95969322f51/1:1/w_160/18831570.jpg,2006-01-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2900-the-weed-tree-ep/,Locust,"Of all the acts on the crowded landscape of contemporary psych-folk, Philadelphia's Espers have perhaps the deepest, most abiding reverence for classic late 60s-era British folk. So it comes as little surprise that they've followed their excellent 2004 debut LP with The Weed Tree, a short collection of covers in the most stouthearted folkloric tradition. The set blends traditional folk standards (""Rosemary Lane"", ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"") with tracks from sources both predictable (Nico, Michael Hurley) and not (Durutti Column, Blue Öyster Cult.) Yet throughout the album Espers are able to deliver these disparate tracks with enough quiet authority and sheer transportive beauty to ever settle into stale mimicry, blurring the origins of the songs until they each seem to have been issued from a single fertile source. Still centered around the nucleus of Greg Weeks, Meg Baird, and Brooke Sietinsons, The Weed Tree finds the group having officially grown into a sextet, and their expert arrangements here are a dense thicket of guitars, cello, recorders, and various spirited embellishments. Beneath the music's placid surfaces, however, stirs a current of discontent, as nearly every song is built on the time-honored folk traditions of loss, unrequited love, and/or isolation. When coupled with the occasional stray flare of acidic dissonance, these downcast lyrical themes provide a necessary counterpoint to Espers' frequently breathtaking vocal harmonies and pristine instrumentation, giving this disc a subtle but commanding dramatic sweep. Particularly telling is the group's version of ""Black Is the Color"", one of the most covered songs in the folk canon. In its oldest form this song is a simple ballad of devotion, but Espers have characteristically chosen the darker path, with Weeks and Baird joining in exquisite lament on a verse left off in many versions: ""Satisfied I will never be/ I'll write him a letter, just a few short lines/ And suffer death a thousand times."" This thread of desperate longing carries over to their covers of the Durutti Column's ""Tomorrow"" and Nico's ""Afraid"", while their Bert Jansch-inspired rendition of ""Rosemary Lane"" reminds us that our romantic miseries don't necessarily end upon an affair's consummation. Nearly every group, folk or otherwise, could benefit from covering a Michael Hurley song, and Espers strike paydirt on their take of his ""Blue Mountain"", shooting its melody through with disorienting whistles that resonate like a canyon full of intoxicated songbirds. This heavily-reverbed disorder leads quite comfortably into their molten version of BÖC's ""Flaming Telepath"", with Weeks' quicksilver guitar excursions effortlessly transcribing the self-medicated despair of the lyrics. And as The Weed Tree closes with its sole Espers original-- the percussive, Eastern-tinged ""Dead King""-- one is left with the strong impression that the group is just now beginning to fully synthesize their various influences to map their own seductive trail through the moonlit folk woodlands.","A short collection of covers in the most stouthearted folkloric tradition, this EP features re-interpretations of works by Nico, Durutti Column, and Blue Öyster Cult.

What's Real?,Les Angles Morts,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf0abf31b7dc715606d/1:1/w_160/e2d3cb0f.gif,2006-01-03 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4996-whats-real/,Blue Skies Turn Black,"Early in their career, the Arcade Fire experienced a bit of an implosion, resulting in two members, Myles Broscoe and Brendan Reed, exiting the band. The two, who played on the Arcade Fire's debut EP, left and joined Kyle Fostner and Owain Lawson, forming Les Angles Morts and writing innovative instrumental music. Their debut full length, What's Real?, is at times frantic, with hyperactive drumming and squealing analog synths, and at times haunting and ominous, building layers of guitars and droning keyboards. The album fuses post-rock with post-punk, indie rock with noise, and its biggest undoing is the lack of focus. The band refers to the music they create as post-punk movie scores, and its live performances are multimedia affairs based as much on video as audio. Perhaps this offers a clue as to why this disc seems so randomly organized. There are tracks here that sloppily layer the instruments at full volume, creating a cacophony of chirping, banging, and squealing. But there are also soft, moody pieces that incorporate multiple acoustic guitars, quiet droning, and minimal percussion. The songs that show restraint are ultimately successful, while the noisier tracks tend to be so clamorous that they become grating. Had the band reigned in some of their chaotic tendencies, a much more consistent record would've resulted. Consider opener ""What's Real Summer?"", which begins with electronic blips and a restrained rhythm section interplaying bass and drums. The mood is held for only 30 seconds, however, before it bursts into a swirling mess of cymbal crashes and high-pitched synths. The song soon shifts again, this time to incorporate siren-like squeals from the synthesizers, but it never regains the calm, brooding nature. ""Kaleidoscope"" suffers similarly, its distortion cutting through the mix and acting like its own instrument, intent on distracting the listener from the rest of the track's sounds. ""Portals"" irritatingly blasts through its first half with several repeating guitar notes over a fast bass-snare beat, but then sobers up and transforms into an emotive, poetic piece. The track sums up the entire album in under 90 seconds. When the band approaches its songs more judiciously and focuses on one style, the results are pleasant. ""Huge Antlers"" is like the theme to a warped spy movie, with reverb-heavy guitar over an almost constant snare roll. Likewise, ""Wave Pool"" dabbles in lo-fi surf, maintaining a steady, restrained tempo and tone throughout. One of the album's pleasant surprises, ""Waking Up a Maze"", is constructed almost entirely of strumming acoustic guitars in a flamenco-like rhythm augmented by shaking tambourines and quiet, rumbling drums. There are a few tracks where the band is able to maintain its blend of genres without spiraling out of control. ""Ninja Garden"" evokes images of man-in-a-rubber-suit monster attacks with its robotic background howling and desolate synth grumbles. ""Sing Together"", possibly the strongest track here, begins with a syncopated dance beat, and the crisp, metallic guitars cut across the top of the low- end synth and bass rumbling. The tension builds along with the instruments as a sort of march-of-the-damned occurs just over a minute in. The track is menacing, and it manages to convey a sense of dread and panic without resorting to chaos. It's a shame Les Angles Morts haven't delivered this level of quality throughout the album.","Former Arcade Fire members head this post-rock meets post-punk band.

Right away, you know Todd Drootin is on some freaky shit: Not only does the cover art's Books on Tape logo have an umlaut over the ""p"", but it also has them under the ""k"" and the ""n."" Dude, stop, I can't even do that with my keyboard! Drootin, on the other hand, can do lots with his various inputs, drum machines, and samplers, and while Dinosaur Dinosaur makes for good interstate driving music, it might have you concerned you've drifted onto the rumble strip. Speaking of audio-lit, this project shouldn't be confused with that of better-known electronic manipulators the Books. Where that group is solemnly stony, Drootin's beatscapes are more deranged and abrasive. As sonic reshaping goes, Dinosaur Dinosaur is less interested in making a statement-- for instance, there are no broad intuitive leaps between recognizable samples-- than in making a racket, pulling open a silverware drawer full of variously-oxidized but uniformly spindly percussion on the profoundly apolitical ""Noise Is Political"", then sending it down the terror chute of ""Killing Machine"", ravaged with clipped syllables and rhythmic moans, a punchy staccato melody and floppy bass, and a stabbing swarm of synths. Mellower tracks like ""Surly Ambassador"" sound like Jason Forrest tweaking a long Boards of Canada loop until he just can't take it anymore, then ratcheting it up to a hectic house bounce that picks up debris like a Katamari before collapsing into a sinister dirge. This music can't sit still: Densely detailed and riotous mini-compositions frantically leapfrog over each other; old grooves split before they wear out their welcome and come back with new haircuts; the electronic scalpel makes mincemeat of the obsolete analog cadaver. And later, the dumb tropicalia of ""Bubblegum"" gets flash-frozen by the shifting digitalia blowing around it, and the anthemic guitars on ""Upon Rock City"" decay into stuttering glitch-fests at both ends: rock music body-modded toward ambiguity in the age of elective sonic surgery.","Deranged, abrasive beatscapes and densely detailed and riotous mini-compositions from Alien8.

The Dream House/Dedications to a Flea,Windy & Carl,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa4aea9e61561daa5b8c/1:1/w_160/a2cfa7f1.gif,2006-01-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11865-the-dream-housededications-to-a-flea/,Kranky,"Perhaps because they've had us on a first-name since the beginning, Windy & Carl have always seemed grounded and unpretentious. Their music contains a certain amount of mystery, with drones hinting at a shadowy world even as the placid surface drifted toward new age, but the makers always struck me as approachable. It's a quality best illustrated by the amiable intimacy of the Windy-penned liner notes on Introspection, the late 2002 singles and rarities box that ushered in a period of semi-retirement. Early in 2005 Windy & Carl were persuaded by a friend to release a handmade CD-R to launch the small-run Brainwashed Handmade label. Their inspiration for the new project was the recent death of Flea, the dog they had cared for together for 14 years. This release pairs a reissue of Dedications to a Flea with a second album of new material called Dream House. Flea is pictured on the record sleeve and Windy tells the dog's story with a staggering amount of detail on the booklet inside. A thousand-word essay about a beloved pet is a strange gesture for an album's liner notes, sure, but coming from these two it seems a little less unusual. Text aside, the music is a welcome return to form. Windy & Carl will probably never reach the focus achieved on their masterpiece, 1998's Depths, but these two albums show they're still able to build an effective atmosphere. This is long-form Windy & Carl with textural skill intact; four tracks stretch across two CDs and none of them seems in any particular hurry. ""Ode to a Dog"" has the peaceful, cloud-drift ambience that filled Consciousness, with Windy's repeating bass pulse framing Carl's sheets of sheer, light-catching feedback. ""Sketch for Flea"" pairs a ""field recording"" of Flea on a walk-- complete with pants and the sound of rain on the sidewalk-- with a more ominous rumble of guitar hum. The latter track is particularly striking, with the thrashings of the departed dog lending an unpredictable air to the patiently unfolding drone. The Dream House opens with ""The Eternal Struggle"", which I believe is, at 32 minutes, the longest track Windy & Carl have released. There is more here than merely keeping the drone going for twice as long as usual, though; in fact ""The Eternal Struggle"" seems quite composed relative to W&C;'s typical Eno-esque ""horizontal"" method. Though changes happen slowly the structure suggests symphonic movements, with the long opening organ drone serving as the tonal center toward which other instruments gravitate, and surges of noise dominate the last few minutes. ""I Have Been Waiting to Hear Your Voice"" closes the set with a Fripp-inspired lead carving a melody from an icy extended chord. The stated inspiration for The Dream House is LaMonte Young's installation of the same name, but Windy & Carl's world is so much more human and imperfect. The eternal magnificence of physics informs the work of the old master but Windy & Carl's steady-state pieces never lose touch with the limitations of the organic, the most significant of which being the thing that took Flea from them.","Kranky pairs a new record from the dream-pop duo with a previously released pair of tracks written in honor of a lost pet.

Dreamies: 2006 Special Edition,Dreamies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba14c0084474cd0c276a/1:1/w_160/7d523b67.gif,2006-01-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2449-dreamies-2006-special-edition/,Gear FabGear Fab,"For one year in the early 70s, Bill Holt lived the real American dream: quitting your job to do something you love. In his late twenties and supporting his Delaware family with a disheartening 9-to-5 gig, he decided to make a go of a career in music, in spite of having next to no first-hand musical experience. He holed up in his basement with an acoustic guitar, a few chords, a Moog synthesizer, and assorted electronic devices and created what would prove to be his only opus: Dreamies. The album is a triumph. It's difficult to even place it in context because it's such an oddball little record, on the one hand probing whatever corners of his mind Holt felt were worthy of exploration, and on the other deftly preserving a sense of popular songcraft. Holt structured his album in two side-long suites, ""Program Ten"" and ""Program Eleven"". The numbers he chose were not random: He saw his work as a direct continuation of what the Beatles did on ""Revolution 9"", packing it with found sound, including a couple of boldly snatched samples of ""I've Just Seen a Face"", ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", ""Oh! Darling"", and ""All You Need Is Love"". Not that sampling other peoples' records got him into trouble. The simple fact is that almost no one heard the album upon its initial release, and the situation has barely improved since. In fact, until Gear Fab records resurrected Dreamies back in 2000 for a limited release, the album was completely unavailable outside of collectors' circles, qualifying it for genuine Lost Classic status. This most recent reissue sounds absolutely fantastic, presenting Holt's hi-fi vision with brilliant clarity, subdivided into tracks of more manageable lengths. As the album opens, President John Kennedy mingles with a field of insects, making his famous payload/payroll gaff in a speech about the space program. This gives way to Holt's acoustic guitar, slowly descending through some basic chords and his mellow, double-tracked vocal. This trippy little song becomes the backbone of a 26-minute odyssey that teeters on chaos at points as radio transmissions, snippets of title fight broadcasts and recordings of shattering glass interrupt and fade, all the while dappled with Moog overdubs. Holt hands the melody to the Moog on occasion, but mostly uses it to create the album's weird, buzzing ambience. On the flip side, ""Program Eleven"" is more aggressive and downcast, featuring a loop of Holt's whispered exhortation to ""just dream"" used as a rhythm, along with numerous samples of gunfire and TV commercials. Holt also appears to have made some of his own field recordings, as apparent subway announcements and dinner conversation leak into the texture, fighting with simple psychedelic pop for the listener's attention while Moogs climb and descend scales. Eventually, the suite veers into jarring passages of noise and overlapping voices. The overall effect is something like a primordial Olivia Tremor Control, and easily as wild and unfettered as anything the Residents were doing in the 70s. Dreamies has its obvious and acknowledged influences-- the Beatles and John Cage chief among them-- but it's also clearly the work of an untutored auteur dissecting his own mind in the basement on reel-to-reel. Holt never recorded again, as the financial losses he suffered making the album forced him back into the workaday world, but more than 30 years later, his one moment on tape still sounds incredible.","Bill Holt's brilliant, odd one-off-- inspired by John Cage and the Beatles' ""Revolution 9""-- is given a reissue.

This attempted resuscitation, this half-assed memory-stirrer, is a project of the crassest order. It's graverobbing at its most furtive, orchestrated by a master career-tarnisher. Igor Diddy lurks, hunch-backed, quietly approaching your ear: ""Hey there, young consumer, do you like my best friend, the legendary Notorious B.I.G.? Dr. Pha and I, we've breathed new life, created vivacity, and taken creation from God's hands."" It's particularly sad because statement albums were never lost on Biggie. The scope and fearlessness of Ready to Die says as much. The push/pull stories between the then-Sean ""Puffy"" Combs and his meal ticket are renowned. Ever the capitalist, he constantly sought ways to remix street records into pop hits. But Biggie, a natural songwriter, was always conscious of credibility, name-checking Jeru the Damaja and Nas and Gang Starr. For the most part, he could write hits without pandering, instead leaning on a confusing vulnerability/masculinity complex and that chunky voice. All's to say, he was no saint, nor a pariah of pop. But he had integrity. Duets ignores all this precedent by cashing in blindly, amassing pointless guest spots and fusing old verses over tinny, soulless productions. Bad Boy has recruited hacks and hit-hounds like Scott Storch, Jazze Pha, and Swizz Beatz to reconfigure songs that needn't be touched, or gotten sound-specific artists like Akon and Mobb Deep to put together Biggie Smalls-Made-Easy cookie-cutters. The first posthumous B.I.G. release, Born Again, had plenty of problems, but at least unheard music saw the light of day. As far as I can tell, this project is a sham. For years we'd been told that Mister Cee, the DJ credited with breaking Biggie, had a stash of unreleased vocals and freestyles. We were told he was waiting to unleash these vocals for a duets project that would blow our wigs back. That's not this project. There are zero unheard verses here. The list of collaborators ranges from intriguing (Scarface, Nas, T.I.) to groan-inducing (we see you Korn and Nelly), but few of the songs actually leave any impression. The Just Blaze-produced ""Living in Pain"", jacking Biggie and 2Pac's verses from the latter's ""House of Pain"", is the only truly effective track. Sampling Lamont Dozier's sweeping, many-times-flipped ""Blue Sky and Silver Bird"", the song's ululating strings summon an epic sadness, while Mary J. Blige's expertly delivered chorus oozes with conviction. But elsewhere, only a decent Slim Thug verse saves ""Breakin' Old Habits"" from utter mediocrity. Not as much can be said for the middling new R. Kelly and Missy Elliott songs featuring tacked-on verses, or the ludicrous Dipset/Lil' Wayne collaboration ""I'm Wit Whateva"" that doesn't even feature B.I.G.'s vocals. Is this a mistake or are Jim Jones dedications enough to justify inclusion here? Maybe ""Whatchu Want"", the requisite Jay-Z duet (ludicrously credited to the Commission), is a big deal, but it's stock compared to their earlier thriller ""Brooklyn's Finest"". Even the songs that make sense, like ""Get Your Grind On"", with Fat Joe, Big Pun, and Freeway, fall flat. If anything, this compilation will have youngsters scratching their head over what made the Notorious B.I.G. the subject of hero worship. Everything from the foolishly illustrated album art, featuring a stoned-looking Christopher Wallace with a crown slooping off his head, to the overwrought dedications from his kids, mom, and Lil' Cease (!) flounders in the face of his intimidating if overstated legacy. This record has no rhythm or personality-- and truthfully, no reason to exist. The presence of so many of big names speaks to his importance, vis-à-vis the Rapper=Rock Star revolution. But none of these artists can speak to B.I.G. And if they could, something tells me he wouldn't have much to say back.","Shameless holiday cash-grab recycles old Biggie verses in new songs that feature contributions from Jay-Z, Just Blaze, and, um, Korn.

Learn: The Songs of Phil Ochs,Kind of Like Spitting,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba1eb335119a49ecaa4/1:1/w_160/3ce35a9b.jpg,2006-01-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4435-learn-the-songs-of-phil-ochs/,Hush,"As a folk songwriter he wasn't quite Bob Dylan, and as an avant-pop experimentalist he wasn't quite Brian Wilson-- so Phil Ochs unjustly remains on the sidelines of history. So when Kind of Like Spitting not only revives his songs but studies and evangelizes them-- per the liner notes, KOLS has performed these in concert with explanations of who Ochs was and why he still matters-- they deserve praise, especially when they pull it off this well. Ochs wrote lyrics that were topical to his times, from the early '60s through his personal decline (as well as the decline of the anti-war movement) in the early '70s. But in KOLS' hands, they never sound dated. Protest folk songs are a thing of the past but at their best, Ochs' lyrics remain inspired and witty, like the chorus from ""Draft Dodger Rag"": ""I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back/ I'm allergic to flowers and bugs/ And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits/And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs."" ""That's What I Want To Hear"" calls for the downtrodden to come together and form a union, and it's still relevant-- it's just missing a line about rising health care costs. The anti-war anthem ""I Ain't Marchin' Anymore"" recalls the young men sent to die throughout our history, and it would be easy enough to update it for the present-- but thankfully, KOLS leave it alone. Ben Barnett and David Jerkovich share duties on vocals and acoustic guitar, and they do the songs justice with love, enthusiasm, and not too much reverence. Urgent and precise, they find the right tone for this style of brisk folk music, and they only fall short on the vocals: they miss Ochs' dry delivery-- for example, on ""Outside of a Small Circle of Friends"", which comes out with too-obvious scorn-- and also, both singers sound like they've got head colds. It's a common question why, no matter how bad things get, we can't cough up a great protest singer today. But the answer is right here in Ochs' songs: again and again, he criticizes the listener for non-particiation-- for supporting the war but dodging the draft, for skipping out on the riots at the '68 convention, for not stopping a rape or helping the poor. Ochs turned his angriest words on the liberals who talked big and did nothing. But he had no idea where we'd be in the '00s, when staying politically active means keeping your Kerry-Edwards sticker on your bumper a year after the election. Protest music today reeks of nonparticipation and even impotence, from the abstract anxiety that fills Radiohead's '00s albums, to Conor Oberst's ""When the President Talks to God""-- a puerile trainwreck of a song, but also a timely one, because all of the cussing and television-kicking mirrors how Blue Staters act after hearing about Bush's latest adventures on ""All Things Considered"". Today we lack the literacy, the specificity and the argument of a Phil Ochs song because we don't participate, and we have nothing at stake. So my solution is simple: bring back the draft. Sen. John McCain, who wants us to win in Iraq, has probably been thinking about this all along as he calls for higher troop levels and more engagement from the public; and while Rep. John Murtha got the spotlight for saying we should pull out, he has also said that he would love to bring back the draft, drum up the army we need and go back and win this thing-- but he knows it'll never happen. Well, I say that it can. If the Bushies step it up a notch and demand sacrifice, in lives and treasure, from the American people, we will step it up in kind and get serious about complaining and protesting. We won't wag a finger at the TV; we'll march in the streets. And if we don't give it everything we've got, here's hoping the next Phil Ochs shows up to call ""bullshit"" on us all.","Indie band not only revives the 60s protest singer's songs on this covers album but studies and evangelizes them.

Bells Break Their Towers,Bright,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3985e6ef959693206a3/1:1/w_160/545a70a4.jpg,2006-01-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/935-bells-break-their-towers/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"It's been six years since the release of Full Negative (or) Breaks, the last album of new material from Bright, and the hiatus seems to have done little harm to the improvisational duo's finely-textured ambient rock. On the contrary, Bells Break Their Towers might be Bright's craftiest invention yet, as they circle outward to further incorporate layered vocals, narcotic Krautrock repetitions, and cagey post-Slint guitar dynamics into their explorative space-rock. And though on initial pass their orbit may appear to take a rather too familiar post-rock trajectory, here Bright have sufficiently broadened their scope to encompass some lovely and genuinely alien terrain. The core of the group remains guitarist/vocalist Mark Dwinell and multi-instrumentalist Joe Labrecque, but on Bells Break Their Towers the instrumental line-up expands and contracts from track to track as necessary, ranging from the basic duo up to a sextet. This fluidity is somewhat invisible, however, as on these eight pieces Bright make such extensive use of multi-tracking, particularly on Dwinell's vocals, that rarely does the music feature fewer than three instruments at once. So while these tracks have their origins in spontaneous composition, they've also clearly been pored over meticulously in the studio, an approach that sacrifices some of the free particle energy of their earlier recordings in exchange for a balanced clarity and more vigilant celestial navigation. Bright's increased melodic concision is immediately evident on the opening ""Manifest Harmony"", which features a torrent of Dwinell's interlocking vocal streams within a churning eddy of guitar and keyboard. On this track, and other more pop-centric cuts like the endlessly chiming ""Receiver"", his boyish vocals can often be a dead ringer for those of Rob Crow, leaving these songs sounding like a trippier, more cosmically-inclined version of Pinback-- an equation certainly not without its merits. Dwinell's unblemished vocals also fit perfectly into the tranquil currents of ""Flood,"" a trio piece featuring three acoustic guitars exquisitely set into a continually renewing mantra-like dialogue. Acoustic guitar also figures prominently into the 12-minute ""An Ear Out"", one of this set's several extended instrumental transmissions. With its serpentine, quicksilver guitar and patiently unspooling rhythms, this track could be mistaken for a product of the Aerial M/Tortoise/For Carnation axis, but Lebrecque's vigorous acoustic strums and resourceful percussion give the piece a regenerative pull uniquely its own. Even more impressive is the equally-long title track, which adds two basses and Michael Torres' violin to instigate a disorienting, multi-layered drone worthy of experimental acts like Vibracathedral Orchestra, with Bright's swirling winds kicking up enough dust to obscure the rush of the oncoming stars.","After a half-decade wait, the improvisational duo issue another LP of finely-textured ambient rock.

Peace Trials,Kites,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4f13d197565213b2bc/1:1/w_160/f8c6bf8a.jpg,2006-01-02 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4604-peace-trials/,Load,"Peace Trials, maybe, but last time I saw Chris Kites onstage, dude was covered in his own blood. Can't say I remember the sound, so who knows the precise peace content (there were razorblades), but that was also three years ago; these days, sonically speaking, Kites and his political rage have gone from man vs. himself to man vs. his own machine, following the peace sign-shaped tracks of Henry Barnes (Amps For Christ) and Jessica Rylan (Can't). Still, the impulse is sharp: ""Flag Torn Apart"" would be painful, if the handmade sound system didn't quit and thrust the vocals back into the primeval static from which they came. A mere control on raw analog noise, the pseudo-raging voice processes the synth bleat and modulated round tones until it's inarticulate. Colin Langenus, half of the equally loving and raging USAISAMONSTER, pulled the same trick recently on his own recent solo record, creating comedy and incomprehensible static from genuine feeling; the actual music's gone subliminal. ""Exploded Face"" gets down to business as far as non-violent chirpy violence goes, maybe call it brutal noise for beginners, and the redundant ""True"" revisits earlier sequenced noise-box lines, this time bled low against a reluctant, pulled-right-out-of-the-machine and moaning high end. But, to borrow a phrase, most of Peace Trials is a song against itself: death imagery sung in harmony, palindromic vocals working the middle from both sides, crackling transistor warmth merging with the human version of same. Sex and pessimism in the ears, sure, but it's love and drugs on the floor. Kites' got that figured, and his message only benefits from his inability to articulate it; I prefer ""Dirt's"" ""On and On and On/ No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No"" to anybody's righteous breakdown. The most introspective song on here, ""Peace Trials"", is a duet with Erin Rosenthal from the Provi psych band Urdog, and it also just nods at the crux: ""Master's voice/ Radiates/ Peace Trials/ Peace Trials."" Let somebody else figure out the specifics. There is an undeniable provincialism at work here-- one song quotes Three Studies for a Crucifixion, a mid-1990s Ohio hardcore band adopted in New England as the region's own-- and in many ways Peace Trials speaks as well for that kind of regional solidarity as anything in recent memory. The mix of distracted psych, gritty electronics, self-made machines that don't work half the time, and a mostly implied ultra-left politic feels as much like another day in Providence as it does like music. The aural-journalism lays bare an elusive sentiment in the city's abandoned lofts. Maybe meaningless, but at least it's correct.","Load artist offers a mix of distracted psych, gritty electronics, self-made machines that don't work half the time, and a mostly implied ultra-left politic.

Coconuts EP,Jane,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4eeb335119a49ec9ea/1:1/w_160/c63ed0fa.gif,2006-01-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4358-coconuts-ep/,self-releasedself-released,"Recorded in 2002 and originally self-released as a limited-edition CD-R, Coconuts captures the nascent moments of the loose, spirited collaboration between Noah Lennox (Animal Collective's Panda Bear) and DJ Scott Mou. Featuring two long, home-recorded skeletal jams, this early set shows the duo to be already perfectly comfortable-- if not downright beatific-- in each other's company, as they serenely bat various embryonic ideas between their paws. And though the twosome's odd bit of moonlighting still makes the most sense when considered as a side project, this strangely luminous EP stands as evidence that many of Jane's abundant creative promises are yet to be fulfilled. In an interview with The Wire, Lennox described Jane's 2005 album Berserker as being ""like a mix CD with toasting over the top."" While this might be an accurate description of the duo's general methods or work habits, it doesn't provide much insight into the mysteries of their sound, nor do attempts to imprecisely file their work into genres such as ambient or techno. Using little more than a turntable and mixer, on these two tracks Mou spins out an uncluttered field of murky beats and granulated effects, re-casting the medievalism inherent in Lennox's ethereal, wordless vocals into a striking new micro-industrial context. Reportedly created upon the duo's first meeting, the 21-minute ""Coconuts"" is a marvel of psychedelic economy, driven with an unrelenting propulsion that approximates a lo-tech, basement version of Can's ""Mother Sky"". After a couple minutes of quiet scrabbling, the song's rhythm soon settles into a grainy, repetitive lurch, sounding like the vintage equipment of a long-abandoned factory suddenly springing back into action. Along the way, various sprays of unfastened noise or isolated keyboard patterns are examined and then discarded, while Lennox's delicate, sculpted vocals arch elegantly above the clamor. Far more diffuse is the EP's second track, ""Ossie"", which directly anticipates the liquid textures of Berserker. Stretched over the course of 25 minutes, this track has an almost episodic structure, with minutes spent of Lennox wandering desolate through scattered electronic detritus, a landscape that includes the occasional crackle of static that one might too easily mistake for a failing speaker. Midway through, ""Ossie"" does achieve a certain hesitant advancing pulse, but never quite manages to bring all of its distinct particles entirely into concert. Nonetheless, it's encouraging to hear Lennox willing to stray this far afield from the security of the Animal Collective's campfires, and hopefully Jane will soon find the opportunity to further advance upon the gains drawn by these formative recordings.","Originally self-released as a limited-edition CD-R, this 46-minute EP from Animal Collective's Panda Bear and DJ Scott Mou features two lengthy skeletal jams.

First Impressions of Earth,The Strokes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58d9d034d5c69bf3311/1:1/w_160/4358b2ac.jpg,2006-01-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/,RCA,"When Is This It landed in 2001, prognosticators claimed the Strokes would break big, reassert New York's post-punk primacy, and save rock and roll. One out of three ain't bad. Though early references were made to canonical art-rock legends such as Television and the Velvet Underground-- bands that achieved more popularity after disbanding than at their creative peaks-- the Strokes were superstars by comparison: Their debut sold more than 2 million copies worldwide; the Velvets wouldn't crack Billboard's top 100 albums chart until the release of 1985's posthumous VU. But that's where the glory fades: The Strokes simply ascended to mainstream acceptance, leaving a potential underdog rock legacy in the dust, and accruing a truckload of backlash in the process. So one can hardly blame them for cutting their losses and going for broke on their boorishly titled third album, First Impressions of Earth. Here, the Strokes simultaneously settle into diminished expectations (delaying an album until just after Christmas = not screening a movie for film critics) and wildly ratchet up their sound, trying new things, getting weirder, but remaining true to the core of their sound. Though always inhumanly taut, the band has grown even tighter, and now plays with a precision that, while coldly machinelike at times, is impressive more often than not. On songs like ""Juicebox"" and the standout ""Electricityscape"", drummer Fab Moretti and bassist Nicolai Fraiture form a no-nonsense rhythm section that keeps these songs as concise and focused as possible. Albert Hammond and Nic Valensi, meanwhile, build a complex weapons system out of just two guitars, interlocking like Thundercats and launching short singsongy riffs that add tension and spark, particularly on tracks like ""Heart in a Cage"" and ""Razorblade"". But if the group has grown deadlier and more dynamic in their five years together, singer Julian Casablancas still struggles as a lyricist. Perhaps dogged by persistent assertions that he has nothing to say, he finally cracks here, asserting that no one does. ""Seven billion people got nothing to say,"" he moans on album closer ""Red Light"", ""Are you coming on to me?"" And leading up to that summary statement is an insistent defensiveness that curdles otherwise decent songs into tedious self-consciousness. On ""Ask Me Anything"", he admits, ""I've got nothing to say"", and tempers his cynicism with nonsense as proof: ""Don't be a coconut/ God is trying to talk to you."" Of course, no one ever listened to the Strokes for deep insight into the human condition. They benefitted from being in the right place at the right time, coming into their own while the dominant trends of the late 90s were fizzling out. Just like many of the flannel-clad Seattle-ites of that decade (and, arguably, the spandex-sporting hair-metal bands of the 80s), the Strokes encapsulated numerous trends at once, projecting more meaning through their style and sound-- that scruffy hair, weathered denim, slouchy throwback punk-- than through their songs. And regardless of message, Casablancas has proven himself a large and important part of that appeal, for both his physical presence and his vocals, which remain ragged and loose in opposition to the band's rock-solid dynamic. On First Impressions, however, he seems eager to break the mold, but unsure how: On ""Vision of Division"" and ""The Ize of the World"", he strains harder, screaming through gritted teeth; ""Heart in a Cage"" and ""Fear of Sleep"" find him leaning too heavily on repetition of phrases that quickly become grating; during the Pogues-like stomp ""Evening Sun"", he fakes a Shane MacGowan accent for the first few lines before dropping the schtick altogether; and on ""Ask Me Anything"" and ""On the Other Side"", he makes this album the Strokes' loungiest to date. A handful of these modifications are welcome as a change of pace, and at times make First Impressions sound prickly and confident. When the band is on, the songs attain the force and fury of previous outings. Unfortunately, the album is also clogged with a number of tracks that are as sloppy as titles like ""The Ize of the World"" and ""Vision of Division"" suggest. But the band's failures do, if nothing else, possess a certain schadenfreude, allowing a fascinating glimpse at a band futilely grasping in all directions for something new and meaningful, only to fumble with a half-fragment of unformed idea between its desperate fingers.",,5.9,
Hey People!,The Beautiful New Born Children,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a8ea9e61561daa4f64/1:1/w_160/61c83182.jpg,2005-12-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1189-hey-people/,Domino,"After years of indie kids presuming to shake digital ass, the electronic empire has struck back. Popped from the womb short and fuzzy like a Weekly World News monkey baby, the Beautiful New Born Children traffic in garage-punk so red-line retro you can almost hear an NME drop (or is that just tinnitus?). They also happen to be fronted by Michael Beckett, German-based laptopper behind solo project Kpt.Michi.Gan as well as guitarist for electronic outfit Schneider TM. Jimmy Tamborello's gonna be so pissed. Beckett's shift in direction shouldn't come as a complete shock. Guitars were welcome interlopers on Kpt.Michi.Gan's eponymous 2004 effort, which also featured a crunching, vocoded version of the new album's title track. Hey People!, though, is a different creature, blazing through nine sloppy tracks of Libertines sneers, bouncy Strokes rhythms and painstaking haphazardness in about 23 minutes. Beckett is accompanied by wife Kirsten and two friends, all playing instruments other than their own-- to heighten the verisimilitude? Still, squalls of noise and krautrock drone periodically confirm this wasn't recorded in an actual 1960s or '70s garage. Lo-fi veneer aside, Beckett's songs could plausibly receive the same seven-word description as an Art Brut masterpiece-- funny lyrics shouted over basic rock riffage-- but here that's as meh as it sounds. ""I would like to show them how to boogie down,"" he shouts on the album's most cohesive song, ""Paper Mills"". Opener ""Do the Do"" bops around quoting ""Heart-Shaped Box"". The laffs soon shrink, relying on amphetamine and chemical-imbalance jokes as the lyrics become indecipherably distorted. It doesn't help that each two-minute power-chord blast is roughly interchangeable with the next. ""Hey People!"" adds acoustic guitar, but not enough to alter the basic texture. Only closer ""Up and Down and Round and Round"" breaks the formula, blitzkrieging a single chord an extra five minutes or so. For whatever reason, the Beautiful New Born Children's handlers have tried to shroud their identity in mystery. Hey newness rings registers, but maybe Pollyanna the band just wants to be judged on its own merits. OK then: Hey People! isn't bad for a quick spastic freakout, though early comparisons to fast-dumb-loud savants like the Stooges and the MC5 are laughably overstated. The Children infuse their excitable, years-late revivalism with more explosions and less heart than similarly styled technological primitives the Exploding Hearts. In 2004 novel The Confessions of Max Tivoli, Andrew Sean Greer's backward-aging protagonist is born a wrinkled geezer.

Employing a rackful of software he manipulates hundreds of track segments, song bytes, and musical layers into 28 newly-titled pieces, their internal parts laid out under each heading like the gears and sprockets of a dismantled clock. Nothing fuzzy about that; in fact, in many ways DE9: Transitions couldn't be more technical. Even its artwork is calculated, with sleek lines of ASCII text trickling steadily along behind Hawtin's holographic Bowie face. But for all its cold calculation and software product placement, Transitions is also quietly comforting. It's minimal techno married to the schematic of a goose down pillow. A persistent BPM pads through its center, unifying the mix's hundreds of hiccups and digital spindles like the deftest of Calatrava spans. Selections like ""Visioning"", ""The Hole"", and ""Weiter Noch"" incorporate six, seven, even 10 primary sources. But the result is always clean and smooth, mostly because Hawtin aims for assimilation above everything else, no matter the character or duration of the building bits he uses. He's not trying to remake them in his image. The DE9 series was always about exploration, and with Transitions he's taking that notion to its purest form. Tech heads can pick the set apart surgically, trying to discern Pan Sonic's ""Liuos"" from Stewart Walker's ""Lakewalking"" inside ""Visioning""'s velvety tumble. But it's more fun to enjoy its brilliant use of space, to let it drift in four directions between your headphones like a smoothly morphing color bar test pattern. Software was the facilitator, but through painstaking arrangement and meticulous layering Hawtin finds its softer side. There's a purism question, obviously. How far did Hawtin immerse his innate ability as an arranger, DJ, and producer in the microchip acid bath to make this mix? Is the oxide of human element completely washed away? If there are computers powerful enough to toy Kong-like with our puny brains, they certainly exist in Hawtin's home base of Berlin. Those rigs could make us think of pillows where there is only polyurethane, pretend to offer a future of technology warmfuzzies when there are really only methodically blinking cursors. Yikes! But techno heads don't really believe in that kind of Cyberdyne conspiracy anymore, if they ever did. And besides, the ""The Tunnel"" blends elements of Detroit Grand Pubahs' ""Dr. Bootygrabber"" with Mika Vainio's Ø alias, two of Hawtin's own tracks, and Styro2000 for one of Transitions' closest scrapes to truly fervid, live-Hawtin techno. And that's an intangible that technology just can't crack.","Third and final entry in the DE9 series following 1999's Decks, EFX & 909 and 2001's DE9: Closer to the Edit.

Any Minute Now got good enough marks but damn did it bomb big for me, especially since its cranky leadoff single ""NY Excuse"" was in arm's reach of ""Yeah"" in 2004's punkfunk marathon. Soon word of Duran Duran-repping ""Nite Versions"" of AMN tracks fluttered about-- self-done electro retakes fitted for the floor but still uncompromisingly rock-- and a few popped up on that punch-drunk Radio 1 broadcast mix the 2manyDJs brothers did for the BBC back in January. When the NV'd ""Krack"" slowed down summer jams to slurry, breaking up the BPMs like ""Jamrock"" did in hip-hop sets, I had a feeling: A whole album of this shit and we'd have a cruder, crunchier Homework. Figures, Soulwax lead off NV with a cover of Daft Punk's ""Teachers"", names changed for a who's who of dance-rock forefathers (which to my chagrin, includes the goddamn the Who). In the vein of ""AC/DC aren't a metal band, they're a dance band,"" ""Miserable Girls"" grinds hard enough to get on one of those X-Games comps, seering guitar lead and convicted vox trapped interminably in echo. Still these are tracks before new-wave anthems, breakdowns before makeup, with emphasis on the vertical and the power of repetition. Even the vocal hooks are kept to snippets: ""It's not you, it's the e talking,"" or ""compute it!"" or once is enough, ""James Brown is dead."" Like for Munk or LCD Soundsystem, the authority (or something) of live sound plays a part in the NV lure, but Soulwax never overstate. When the comicbookishly dark holds on ""Slowdance"" give out for the bridge, those sixteenths on the high hat effect a lot on their own; ""I Love Techno"" benefits from heavy-handed drum pounds that hold back the song's twitter and Blondie bassline; the legendary ""NY Lipps"" mash between ""NY Excuse"" and ""Funky Town"" speaks for itself. These are simple tracks, sure, confident enough to lay their soundmakers bare (and vice versa), but such staunch anti-pussyfooting/anti-mysticism makes Soulwax a bit more democratic, palpable too. They play what's humanly possible for a quartet, and in fact, rumor has it they may even be playing these nite versions live in Philadelphia at the NYE Making Time party. And if they play NVs track-for-track, as they're peerlessly mixed on the CD, those minor strings that course teary-eyed closer ""Another Excuse"" won't drop the ball.","Remix album greatly improves on last year's disappointing Any Minute Now.

The Singles Collection 03-05 blears through 16 tracks of generally flavorless broth. It's not awful, but in some ways that's worse. While no production affectation could enliven Herren's languid songwriting, it would be nice if he showed some interest in the material. His hand sleepwalks up and down the keyboard, loping grid-drawn phrases with minimal dynamics. Maybe ""Stay Home"" wouldn't be so teflon if Herren tweaked some knobs. The Rhodes can growl like a sprawled-out pit bull guarding his dumpster scraps; Herren's yawns like it's ready for a tryptophan nap. Not even syncopation salvages. Beats either fumble in downmixed free-jazz frottage (""Recuerdas"") or crack from erectness (""Walk Home""). Credit Herren this: His rhythms whittle thin the often stark line separating live and synthetic drum sounds. How does he do it? Seemingly by cooking-cutting live kit snippets, then running them on a conveyor belt until they assume 808 rigidity. Hey, I eat Devil Dogs, too, but that doesn't mean I like seeing them on Unwrapped. So has this guy peaked early? Not at all; he just beatmakes like my buddy Matt plays ""World of Warcraft"": mindlessly and probably at the expense of more important shit, perhaps even actually shitting. Singles Collection cultivates material dating back to 2003, the same year Herren gave us One Word Extinguisher, his praiseworthiest product to date. ""Spring's Arrival"" and ""Running JCH for All His Breaks and Jewels"" play like over-aerated discards from that project. Where One Word tossed its mesclun mix, Herren here cobbles together smudges of sound-- faint wind chimes, light bass bob, lava lamp synth bubbles-- and leaves it at that.

29,Ryan Adams,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a005ea9e61561daa4484/1:1/w_160/3ed276b4.jpg,2005-12-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/44-29/,Lost Highway,"More often than not, Ryan Adams' prolificacy-- check the three full-length records he released in 2005 alone-- is snorted away as a feat of spectacular cockiness, worthy only of eye-rolls and disenchanted sighs. Adams' avalanching output certainly perverts common notions about art-as-pain, perplexing folks who think songwriting should be all clenched fists and bloody fingernails-- but no matter where you land on Adams' preposterous pacing, there's still something compelling (fearless, even) about the display. Produced by Ethan Johns (who worked with Adams on 2000's Heartbreaker and 2001's Gold), 29 features nine songs, each of which portrays Adams, now 31, at a different year in his twenties. The album might be murky and inconsistent, but it's also an eerily apt encapsulation of country-trotting, post-collegiate confusion, and flitting relentlessly between styles, moods, cities, and fucked-up affairs. Scattered, slow-building, and occasionally soporific, 29 is also unfortunately easy to dismiss-- meaning naysayers will miss a handful of perfectly transcendent tracks. Adams has never been particularly skilled at masking his influences, and opener ""29"" is a walloping reinterpretation of the Grateful Dead's ""Truckin'"", with the same squished vocals (including the roll call of American locales), guitar noodles, and thump-thumping percussion. Adams may howl ""singin'"" instead of ""truckin,'"" but the sentiment and the sound remain the same. ""Strawberry Wine"" is eight minutes of muffled acoustic guitar and falsetto, a slow-burning, lyrically-meandering rumination on west coast slumps, high and sad, nodding to both Devendra Banhart and Neil Young. On first listen, ""Strawberry Wine"" plods, but the track is impeccably recorded (Johns manages to tangle a 12-string and a eukele into Adams' guitar lines, building a tingly, strummy haze), and Adams' penchant for storytelling is awfully well-showcased. Even the song's sluggish pacing is ultimately justified, as Adams' whimpers ""I'm getting older/ Gotta break out,"" wailing desperately, incessantly-- as if he doesn't quite know how to stop himself from making noise. The thick, elegiac ""Night Birds"" is 29's most memorable track, and one of Adams' better vocal performances, as he moans over hollow piano riffs, lamenting all the stagnation and hopelessness of being 26: ""I feel like a body stuffed into a trunk/ From a million years of light/ And getting drunk."" ""Night Birds"" is a haunting dirge (and introduces themes-- sinking, especially-- that pop up over the course of 29), but Johns leans too heavily on volume and echo here; Adams already has a habit of coordinating sounds and lyrics in a way that's distractingly deliberate, and by song's end, the chorus (""We were supposed to rise above/ But we sink/ Into the ocean"") is so bloated with reverb it's hard not to cringe a little, fighting off the implied portrait of Adams splashing helplessly into the sea. The pedal steel-riddled ""Carolina Rain"" follows in the country-travelogue footsteps of Cold Roses and Jacksonville City Nights, all railway lines, fried eggs, southern cities, and freight cars teeming with granite. ""The Sadness"" is full of wiggly, Ennio Morricone-inspired spaghetti guitar, while ""Elizabeth, You Were Born to Play That Part"" is a piano-and-vocals meditation on loss and depression. Stunning closer ""Voices"" sees Adams employing Biblical players to convey proper despondency, howling ""Elijah/ Don't you call,"" repeatedly invoking the messenger's miraculous firestorm (battling the prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel, Elijah shot fire from heaven to prove God's power.) ""We're never coming back, once the signal's been fired,"" Adams roars, over barely-there acoustic strums. ""Run away from the light."" Self-serious and wildly inconsistent (in both ingenuity and style), 29 is hard to swallow without acknowledging and appreciating the record's overarching storyline: getting through your twenties is way hard. Adams may churn out heaps of uneven tracks-- unfiltered and unedited, scrappy and undercooked, too long, too earnest, too much-- but 29 still fulfils its narrative promise, in terrifically failed, oddly beautiful ways.","Prolific singer/songwriter issues his third full-length of the year, a conceptual work on which each track portrays the singer, now 31, at a different year in his twenties.

Hard to Love a Man EP,Magnolia Electric Co.,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53d0c2bba1b7de0141c/1:1/w_160/7b15aeda.jpg,2005-12-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5632-hard-to-love-a-man-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Let's begin at the end, with the cover of Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London"" that closes Magnolia Electric Co.'s Hard to Love a Man EP. Mike ""Slo-Mo"" Brenner's always elegant guitar work makes it clear that the song is probably a barnstormer live, probably saved for the first encore so that the band can cut loose on its signature three-part riff. On CD, though, it sounds drained of blood: Jason Molina and co. re-create it nearly note for note, down to the end-of-song shout-out ""Draw blood!"" What's the point, then? It's certainly not Molina's earnest vocal delivery, which foregoes the original satirical edge for a dull sincerity. ""Little old lady got mutilated late last night""-- that's so sad. Plus, his howls are weak. Even the Kidz Bop Kids' cover of ""Werewolves of London"" has more bite than this one, but Magnolia Electric Co.'s version is at the very least somewhat instructive: Falling beyond the band's range, the track highlights their weaknesses as surely as it reflects their strengths on this EP. The three new songs here are prime Co.-- slow, subtle, bluesy, and bleary, but also unsettled, as if they're still developing and mutating even as you listen. Produced by Paul Mahern, these songs move glacially, but with much more confident purpose than ""Werewolves"", even if their ultimate ends are unclear at their beginnings. ""Bowery"" stumbles down a dark alley, tripping on Molina's ruminative regrets: The slow beat and decorous piano comprise a ponderous rhythm section against which Molina sounds determinedly doomed. Mike Kapinus's organ thrums through ""Doing Something Wrong"" and ""31 Seasons in the Minor Leagues"", sadsack laments about agony and defeat: ""You ain't gonna win the game,"" Molina sings on the latter, ""Hell, kid, you don't even know the coach's name."" These three songs lead us back to the title track, which kicks off the EP. The first single from this year's album What Comes After the Blues, the depressive ""Hard to Love a Man"" finds Molina singing presumably about himself in second person: ""It was hard to love a man like you/good-bye was half the words you knew."" The song, like the man, retreats into itself, the elegant blending of pinprick guitars, drums, and truly alien pedal steel creating a new, closed-off world within the song. Molina's too concerned with death (which often lends easy gravity, but here resounds more strongly for being unspoken) to put across the animated ""Werewolves of London"", but he makes ""Hard to Love a Man"" sound like a cross-country funeral parade. Maybe he should have tried ""Searching for a Heart"".","Latest from Jason Molina's band includes three new songs and a cover of ""Werewolves of London"".

Ominosity,Milemarker,by: Cory D.

Since the early days of the band, members have shifted, entered, and exited, and the entire group has relocated from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Chicago. The albums released over the band's first four years reflected these changes, as their sound constantly shifted, covering the full range of post-hardcore styles. After 2002's Satanic Verses, the group slowed down its relentless record, tour, repeat schedule. The result fifth LP Ominosity, a confident, focused piece, where the band seems to have finally found its footing. The disc opens with ""Killed on Public Transit"", which begins as a hushed, atmospheric piece, but explodes into powerful mid-tempo rock two-thirds of the way through. The style and skill of Steve Albini and Greg Norman, the disc's producers, are apparent. They help the band cram guitars, keyboards, and layers of lead and backing vocals into a tight space without bullying any individual portion of the track. The sound fits the band perfectly; the snapping drums, the wet guitar-tone, and the doubled-up vocals inject a sense of foreboding into the songs. Ominosity blends of the band's various styles: ""Food Chain"" is a melodic, new-wave dance tune during the verses, with a raucous chorus of shouted backing vocals and densely weaved guitars and synthesizers. The album's centerpiece is ""Sun Out"", an eight-minute dirge that pounds out of the speakers with thick, distorted bass and guitars and haunting violin. The album's other lengthy track is ""Rivers of Blood"", which clocks in at over eight minutes and spews forth as much vitriol and venom as the rest of the album combined. Its jerky math-core rhythm and screamed vocals lead into a lengthy, echoing breakdown. The final three minutes build up instrumentally, essentially rebuilding everything torn apart in the first five. There are a few misses here too, though the biggest problem is that the LP's uniformity, which makes some tracks seem less than engaging. ""Deserted"", with its surf-inspired guitar strumming, tribal-esque drums, and low-mixed, squeaky vocals never quite takes off. Furthermore, ""Rambler"" is like a demented blues song, but the shouted vocals throughout the verses just don't work with the precise acoustic guitar work and the ethereal chorus. If album closer ""Hydrochondria"" was positioned earlier in the disc, it would be an odd piano interlude that would effectively break up the tension elsewhere. But instead, it follows ""Rivers of Blood"" and provides a weak conclusion to a turbulent disc.","Fifth album from the shapeshifting post-hardcore band.

Soon There Will Be... EP,Shooting at Unarmed Men,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c89d034d5c69bf3613/1:1/w_160/7641cd6a.gif,2005-12-14 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7839-soon-there-will-be-ep/,Beggars,"Not a very sensitive name for a band, but as it was with guitarist John Chapple's former band Mclusky, nothing here should be taken too seriously. Somehow considered an EP despite containing 10 tracks (including a hidden one), Soon There Will Be... is the first release from Chapple's long-standing side project. Shooting at Unarmed Men don't sound much like Mclusky-- they're undeniably lo-fi, and neither as loud nor as frantic-- but they manage to withhold the volume while sounding just as distinctive. Like Ian Mackaye's recent Evens project, Soon There Will Be... veers from sloppy punk to scaled-back songs, albeit gleefully brutish where their D.C. brethren were graceful. Mclusky's primary singer, Andy Falkous, crammed in syllables to convey the band's dark humor, but Chappple limits himself to concise, one-line truisms. (Everybody sing: ""Don't go fucking in the barn...""). The approach is much the same, and his vocals are just as coarse, though he's got more than enough angst, ideas, and energy for an entire album (or EP, whatever). ""Taking Care of Business"" opens the record on a calm note, with clean upstrokes and demure drums. Mclusky's calmer moments always hit straight to the gut when coming between all the chaos, but SAUM pull the same trick without the volume. Chapple sets up an us-and-them theme with lyrics about cursing the self-employed, and an even quieter, almost poignant chorus of ""They're not as clever as we think they are."" At first listen, it may sound like a grunge band who couldn't afford a Big Muff, but these short and sweet lo-fi punk songs are hymnals for young, happy drunks who woke up and found themselves in shitty 9-to-5s in a cubicle or a warehouse, wondering what happened. ""Taking Care of Business"" just gets all that gravitas out of the way, so ""Four Eyed McClayvie"" brings back the thrash with some of Mclusky's snide self-deprecation (""Can anybody cope with another song?/ Well we're gonna play one anyways""), though fidelity holds it back from kicking up the same kind of dust as Chapple's old band. Elsewhere, the rallying cry of ""Impunity Rules"" skewers productivity goals over two galloping chords (""40 percent means you could do a lot better"") and ""The Long and Short of It"" is delightfully inane, chanting ""I love beer"" before hunching over into a boneheaded three-note riff. ""No One Can Waltz"" is a squeaky wanna-be military march and the group sing-along single ""The Pink Ink"" is undeniably catchy, though from the incidental studio patter that introduces it to the shouts of ""That's the spot!"" in the chorus, it shows its cheek at every opportunity. It works, too: These songs continue Mclusky's penchant for displaying a twisted, melodic sweet tooth underneath the thrash, and that bodes well for a proper album.","Debut release from former Mclusky guitarist John Chapple.

1980 Forward: 25 Years of 4AD,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85eb1335d7bf169927a/1:1/w_160/43f07c0e.gif,2005-12-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2107-1980-forward-25-years-of-4ad/,4AD,"This could be the best-sequenced label compilation I've ever seen, and not just in the usual mixtape ebb-and-flow sense. No, the order of these tracks is practically a form of rhetoric, and it has a pretty convincing argument to make concerning 4AD's whole status as a label. No kidding: The 18-track listing for this disc had me all primed to pick on it, but something about listening through the songs, in order, makes that a whole lot harder. The issue is that this London imprint has two sides. On one hand, it's the prime indie-world example of how a label can maintain a cohesive, reliable aesthetic. Through the end of the 1980s, 4AD's style was the sort you'd expect from a weirded-out college punk who majored in Art History so she could stare at gory Renaissance paintings and Baroque cathedrals: a mix of operatic singers, classicist ambience, gothic post-punk, hallucinatory New England college-rock, and-- above all-- great dreamy spangles of arty pop. Bauhaus, Cocteau Twins, Throwing Muses, Dead Can Dance; the feel was coherent and totally singular, from the music to Vaughn Oliver's signature album covers-- which looked, alternately, like Modernist journals and microscopic details from pre-Raphaelite oil paintings. And all of it could culminate in label head Ivo Watts-Russell's studio project, This Mortal Coil, which made a bona fide cover band of his particular tastes-- for minimalist arrangements, fancy digital keyboard pads, and the female voice. On the other hand, 4AD is not some kind of cult. The label's catalog packs any number of releases that are remembered completely independent of any 4AD ""sound""-- from the Pixies to ""Pump up the Volume"", and from there to a modern-day roster featuring the Mountain Goats and TV on the Radio. So when you hit that 25th anniversary and sit down to put together a retrospective, you have a decision to make: How much is this label dead, and how much is it alive? How much are you going to canonize the stuff that defined your aesthetic, and how much are you going to throw together a label sampler for the acts you're repping now? Is this going to be a treat for devotees who really want some Dif Juz and Clan of Xymox obscurities dug out of the vaults, or is it going to be a grab-bag of singles from popular backstock like Blonde Redhead and the Breeders? And that's where the sequencing comes in. The answer probably leans toward ""the latter,"" but something about the order of these songs makes the question feel meainingless. If there's a rhetoric built into that song order, the message is simple-- that every 4AD signing, from 1980 to the present, is part of the same aesthetic. That the Mountain Goats are as much a part of 4AD's ""style"" as Lush ever were. That 4AD has maybe spent the past 25 years making one giant mixtape for us, of which this is just one version. None of that stops this from being much more of a label sampler than 4AD fans will care for. But just look at the first four tracks here. It kicks off with a brief chant from one of the label's most idiosyncratic projects-- Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, recordings of a Bulgarian women's choir whose voices work in such close, near-dissonant Slavic intervals that the vibrations themselves seem to make you shiver. From there it's a short leap into the flowery bursts and fluttering vocals of Cocteau Twins, the band that did the most to turn 4AD style into a major force. And then: TV on the Radio's ""New Health Rock"", whipping up double-part falsetto rock chants in a way that suddenly seems like the natural next step. And then: The Birthday Party's grinding post-punk noir, completely of a piece with everything you just heard. It all flows like this, thanks in part to careful representation of each artist-- not always the best-remembered track, but the one that fits the scheme. The minimalist dream-pop of His Name Is Alive leads into the fluffier dream-pop of Pale Saints. A recent acoustic Breeders track leads off to Throwing Muses and the Pixies, covering all three poles of the spindly Massachusetts indie-rock this label nurtured into fame. A full-band Mountain Goats chug leads naturally into Tarnation's arty old-country, and the goofy Gregorian new-goth of Dead Can Dance leads naturally into a spooky, minimalist album track from Blonde Redhead. Mojave 3, Belly, Red House Painters-- scanning down the list of artists makes it look like an advertisement for what's in stock at the warehouse, but listening through the offbeat song selections and their intuitive sonic links makes it sound like a mixtape of the best and most personal sort. All of which means that I should never have called this a retrospective, right? Anyone looking for a snapshot of 4AD's signature sound would have better luck with 1987's Lonely Is an Eyesore. Anyone looking to see what 4AD is releasing now won't exactly need to hear Cocteau Twins and Wolfgang Press on this disc. Anyone looking for a real retrospective will just have to wait, one supposes, until 4AD closes up shop and does the obligatory box-- all the highlights, from This Mortal Coil's soundtrack-staple version of ""Song to the Siren"" to ""Pump up the Volume"" to, umm, ""I Melt With You"". For now, you are indeed looking at a form of that convenient sales-pitch, the label sampler. Only this ranks as a very well-made one: One guy picking his way through some of the songs he likes and has liked, and organizing them, mix-tape style, in a way that expresses his tastes-- and making a decent case for those tastes as a growing, changing, on-going concern, instead of some period piece from 15 years back.","The 25-year history of the influential 4AD label is compressed into this 18-track LP, which features the Breeders, Cocteau Twins, Throwing Muses, Mountain Goats, and Pixies, among others.

It's Art Dad,The Clientele,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fb13d19756521390a7/1:1/w_160/92c58d19.gif,2005-12-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1508-its-art-dad/,self-released,"I imagine the title of this record, a tour souvenir collecting material recorded between 1991 and 1996, as an answer to an angry father's shouted question about the infernal racket coming from a teenager's bedroom. ""What is that shite, Alasdair?!"" Of course, this being the Clientele, the racket isn't so loud; it probably sounded rather soothing coming through the cracks in the door as the rest of the family went around their business. Even at this early stage the Clientele could write tightly constructed but wistful melodies, and with whatever crude 4-track set-up they had going they knew how to circle every instrument, voices included, with a warm aura of echoing loveliness. During these embryonic years the Clientele included Innes Phillips, who eventually went his own way with his band the Relict. It's Art Dad roughly alternates songs by Phillips and current Clientele leader Alasdair MacLean. The pair obviously shared a vision but Phillips' flatter tone occasionally alludes to a more gothic road not taken. On ""Graven Wood"" for example, his croon oddly calls up a grim world, vaguely referencing the sort of icy remove invented by the Velvet Underground. When MacLean follows next with ""Dear Jennifer"", with its pop melody and opening lines ""Dear Jennifer, do you remember, fields of golden grain? Where butterflies and evening sunlight circle 'round again?"" we return safely to the familiar warm nostalgia Clientele eventually perfected. That's what early experiments are for, though-- trying things on to see what fits. Fortunately, the appeal of It's Art Dad extends beyond the archeological. No matter the band, expectations should always be low for an album's worth of songs recorded before any officially released material and then shelved for almost 10 years. But some of these songs are still surprisingly great. The effortless tunefulness of ""St Paul's Beneath a Sinking Sky"" and ""Elm Grove Window"" argue that great songwriters are born not made; either could be spruced up and worked into an album as good as Strange Geometry. And ""February Moon"", a brooding mood piece with just guitar and voice, is almost shocking in the power of its affect, considering the level of technological sophistication that went into it. It helps that the Clientele's aesthetic suffers little from lo-fi interpretation. Drums can be nothing more than a ride cymbal and snare rim tap and still work; guitars manage to ring through the hiss and compression; voices are channeled through a guitar amp with the reverb cranked to simulate classic AM radio production. The pinched and distant aspect of Clientele's sound still signifies on a 4-track, even when the songs aren't up to snuff (both ""August Sky"" and ""The Words We Knew"" are sub-B-side quality, a few more are only slightly more inspiring). For fans only? Of course-- it's a tour-only release. As they go, this is a good one.","Archival collection, originally sold on the Merge group's recent U.S. tour, compiles early demos recorded between 1991-96, when songwriting duties were split between current band leader Alasdair MacLean and former member Innes Phillips (the Relict).

Black One,Sunn O))),by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b8ea9e61561daa51d8/1:1/w_160/f5ea262e.jpg,2005-12-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7581-black-one/,Southern Lord,"People fixate, but there's more to Sunn 0))) than robes and the Earth and AMP-derived name. Not only does the band's dark, heavy, theatrically composed sixth album, Black One, transcend the duo's previous material, overall it's one of the strongest records of the past year: Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley have unleashed a doom'n'gloom masterpiece. Ultra cinematic and nearly matching Sunn 0)))'s live power, Black One's seven tracks will even please those who can't deal with uninterrupted drone. Getting assistance from key friends, including harsh noise icon John Wiese, the band overlaps smaller drone bits with the usual gargantuan exercises-- its staged like corpsepainted Noh drama. Opener ""Sin Nanna""-- on which the wonderful Australian experimental guitarist and percussionist Oren Ambarchi handles all the instruments-- is the mood setter, and is named for a moon god who sported a lapis lazuli beard and rode a winged bull. It's followed by ""It Took the Night to Believe"" which transitions the listener into the longer works. The six-minute piece begins in media res, as if the recording tape hits a snag and snaps back into action. Power chords drop in quick succession over smoky bass drone; the brutal ghost cry comes courtesy of U.S.-based black metal favorite Leviathan, aka Wrest. In some regards it's Sunn 0)))'s most straightforward metal song to date, though its series of ebb/flows is anything but typical. The bulk of the album-- each of the final five tracks are at least eight minutes long, with four of them moving past the 10:00 mark-- begins with an extended cover of Immortal's ""Cursed Realms (of the Winterdemons)"". Here Xasthur aka Malefic is cast asunder, grumbling about ravens, cursed realms, and the central thesis that ""the face of the earth/ Will be to know black silence."" It's more than two times as long as the original and built largely around Malefic's sub-tonal scowls and bleeding feedback drone. Then comes the more old-school Sunn 0)))- and Earth-sounding ""Orthodox Caveman"", 10 minutes of pure drone made flesh with Wiese's digital noise and Ambarchi on drums. ""CandleGoat"", which O'Malley says is ""an evolution of an artwork collaboration with Savage Pencil,"" includes soft-lit ambiance at its intro courtesy of Wiese and features a gravel-voiced O'Malley on the mic. Each piece is strong, but the album's highlight is its glacial, sprawling, anguished closer, ""Báthory Erzébet"". The track's a reference to Elizabeth Báthory, and likely also the Swedish black metal band her surname spawned. Báthory was an occult-friendly member of the Transylvanian royal family who is reputed to have killed hundreds of young girls. Some legends even claim she thought the lifeblood of virgins would keep her young, so she not only tortured and killed her victims but also bathed in or drank their blood. Báthory died in 1614 imprisoned in her own castle. Perhaps mirroring Báthory's lock-down, Sunn 0))) crammed Malefic in a casket (inside a Cadillac hearse) with only a microphone and his fear of small spaces. His resulting petrified, dry-bones performance and the claustrophobic recording technique should net a Grammy. Leading up to the star turn's a gentle hum throughout which Ambarchi weaves in a gong, bells, cymbal, and guitar. Then comes the teeming Anderson/O'Malley assault, announcing the most triumphant avant-rock moment in recent memory. Okay, Anderson and O'Malley have long hair and they populate their ambient universes with some likeminded players (whether Julian Cope or Joe Preston), but there's no reason for their work to be ghettoized as some cartoonish Dungeons & Dragons dog-and-pony show. I've spoken at length to O'Malley and can say, without a doubt, that he's one of the most intelligent people I've encountered (from any walk of life) and that he and Anderson plan to continually refine and complicate both their sound and the theories they hold about musical composition. (The last person I encountered so knowledgeable and rigorous about his own work was Tony Conrad.) With Black One, Sunn 0))) harnesses the sounds and moods of black metal, then expands its palette through meticulous experimentation and a commitment to the physicality of sound. The result is a beautiful, deep, passionate reflection of life's bleakest corners.

Talk Like Blood,31Knots,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88dc0084474cd0c0e57/1:1/w_160/edbc8086.jpg,2005-12-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8274-talk-like-blood/,Polyvinyl,"Raise your hand if you've ever thumb-wrestled. Wow, everyone except you guys from the sawmill? Great. Take a smoke break. The rest of you might recall a little something known as ""the sneaky finger."" The sneaky finger is a real wild card. No one's quite sure how close to legal it actually is, but for my money the sneaky finger can't close the deal-- the index finger slips out of the grip, pulls down the opposing thumb just long enough to implement the official thumb-pin. 31Knots's third LP, Talk Like Blood, has a sneaky finger of its own. You're distracted by the thumb, i.e. the fat-bottomed emo-prog hooks, the twisted metal carcasses thundering down. But it's the little things that sneak out and grab you before the next cascade of unapologetically overwrought vocals polishes you off. It's the blocks of percussive static that the guitars slither around; the malfunctioning recordings of chamber music; the channel-switching effective glissando sawing the beginning of ""Intuition Imperfected""; the highly pressurized drumming and compressed riffs wheezing to life on ""Chain Reaction"". But I'm not kidding about the dominant vocals-- Joe Haege has a huge voice and he's not afraid to let it all hang out. That's going to be a deal-breaker for some no matter how awesomely deformed yet melodic the licks are. Sometimes, like when Haege spleens ""Hell hath no fury like me!"" before the ripped throb of ""Thousand Wars"" drops in, or the spoken word rant at the beginning of the industrial music-box ""City of Dust"", it's too much. Talk Like Blood is different than what we've previously heard from 31Knots, in ways desirable and less so-- their earlier work (specifically thinking of It Was High Time to Escape) hugged a tight border between spacious, intricately polished guitar rock, and chorus-busting emo, but now they've pushed further in both directions. So while the musical side of Talk Like Blood presents a more detailed field than ever before, the vocals and some of their attendant musical dynamics are flatter. Previously those heart-tugging emo hooks were the sneaky finger and the smart, propulsive musical compositions were the thumb, and if they haven't switched places yet, they're trending that way. I'm fine with it for now, but I hope it doesn't go much further.","Spacious, intricately polished guitar rock meets chorus-busting emo.

Here Where Nothing Grows,Ocean,by: Cory D.

Unlike so many other branches of metal, doom has no interest in speed, noodling guitar solos, or flashy shows of technique. Traditionally, the songs lurch slowly and forcefully, placing most of the emphasis on mood and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the usual traits of the genre can be confining. The fuzz-shrouded guitars, the earthquake-inducing bass, and the slow, deliberate pace frequently leave little room for experimentation. Bands like Candlemass, Cathedral, and Electric Wizard have spawned countless imitators, but few have managed to really bring any fresh ideas to the genre. Portland, Maine's Ocean is intent on breaking that mold with their sprawling debut Here Where Nothing Grows. The band has many similarities with doom metal's hall-of-famers, but wrapped in the wall of guitars and desperate, wailing vocals is something more dynamic, recalling both post-rock and black metal. The songs-- there are three, stretched out to a staggering 65 minutes-- don't build as much as slowly and methodically evolve. Transitions happen over the course of several minutes, as the instruments ebb and flow much like the band's namesake. The tracks are primarily instrumental, but when the vocals do eventually burst through the darkness, they immediately demand your attention. Deep, barbaric growls echo with anguish, driving the already hopeless mood even further down. But it's the sparing use of the vocals that allow them to work so well. Whereas other doom metal bands layer so much muck on the instruments that there's never a moment of silence between the sustained feedback and booming drums, Ocean knows how to use empty space to great effect. These songs are bleak and barren, truly exuding impending ruin. The first of the three tracks is ""First Reign"". Its main riff slowly develops over the course of its 21 minutes, at times dropping away completely. The final seven minutes of the song are like an iceberg collapsing, as the melody slowly breaks down before erupting into ""Salt"", the second-- and at 19 minutes, the shortest-- piece here. In many ways, the song is merely a continuation of ""First Reign"", just as ""The Fall"", the disc's closer, builds off of the ideas in ""Salt"". Despite their common elements, though, each track has its own unique moments. ""Salt"" features feedback and hollow, clean guitars that lead into an almost triumphant, epic march. ""The Fall"" picks up the tempo, if only briefly, and then later features eerie whispered vocals. But frankly, the songs aren't supposed to be all that distinct. Here Where Nothing Grows is meant to be once piece, and it is as monolithic, challenging, and unconventional as anything the metal community has seen in recent days.","Three-song, 65-minute debut from the Maine metal band.

The Black Sheep Boy Appendix EP,Okkervil River,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b25e6ef95969322a16/1:1/w_160/0fae038d.jpg,2005-12-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5964-the-black-sheep-boy-appendix-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"*Supplemental Materials * 1 Regarding ""private madness,"" see Pauline Kael, For Keeps: 30 Years at the Movies. (New York: Plume, 1996). p. 601. 2 Following the release of Black Sheep Boy, Will Sheff's vocals have been labeled ""emo"" by various sources. This tag, however, seems misleading, less a stylistic description than a critical tendency to define everything by a prevailing trend. Rather, Okkervil River seems to exist between trends, sharing similarities with emo, alt-country, and Americana, among many others, but never fitting comfortably into one category. 3 The band's follow-up EP, The Black Sheep Boy Appendix, further reveals the fruitfulness of the Black Sheep Boy sessions, held in a hot Texas house crowded with equipment and instruments. These seven tracks (including two short interstitials) develop ideas suggested on the album and introduce some new ones. Specifically, a new musical motif runs throughout most of the EP: a brief melody that's slightly dissonant and fragile, suggesting a precarious emotional balance. The band introduce it in the lead-off track, ""Missing Children"", whose mesmerizingly sinister tension recalls music written for villains from early Disney cartoons. They repeat that theme again in the final track, ""Last Love Song for Now"", but speed it up over the rumbling rhythms. Tied together in this way, the Appendix is obviously bound to the full-length album, but also separate from it, a sovereign thing unto itself. As such, it could be considered a Derridian supplement: an entity that complements, expands, and potentially supercedes a main object while remaining separate from it. 4 The Appendix develops thematically, but it does fill in some narrative holes. For instance, in ""Black Sheep Boy #4"" we learn that the title character lives in a ""battered"" Mustang and has been to Baltimore (which has its own significance within the Tim Hardin canon). As on the album, however, such concrete details are merely impressionistic, enough to lend the story verisimilitude but not enough to close off any additional meanings that could possibly be read into these songs. 5 Unfolding behind the screen of the Black Sheep Boy mythology, perhaps the EP's most vital story is that of the band completing this project and in the process exorcising those creative demons. Will Sheff sings repeatedly of destroying the mirror that reflects the Black Sheep Boy, of banishing it back to its battered Mustang. This idea, perhaps more than the abstracted ram and the Tim Hardin hagiography, lends the Appendix its particular gravity, as if the band has built a mythology that threatens to swallow them. This sentiment is echoed in William Schaff's cover art, which features the Black Sheep Boy driving a sword into its mirror self. 6 As on Black Sheep Boy, the arrangements on the Appendix are well thought out, but still explosive and immediate: Beginning with a short melody from the album's song ""A Stone"", ""Black Sheep Boy #4"" builds steadily to a climax that has Sheff spewing his private madness from his gut, in a performance that mixes gospel fervor and mental breakdown. 7 ""No Key, No Plan"", about grifters on the run, has a rushing pace similar to these three songs, with the band-- especially keyboardist Jonathan Meiburg and drummer Travis Nelson-- churning a tumbling momentum and adding a taunting call and response in the chorus: ""You've never earned your soul,"" sing the band, like a Greek chorus (which seems fitting: Black Sheep Boy could also refer to the Minotaur at the center of the maze). Sheff responds simply, ""I know."" 8 The delicate melody of ""In a Radio Song"" is resurrected on the Appendix in ""Another Radio Song"" and the interstitial instrumental ""A Forest"". 9 Okkervil River choose a very different concluding tack on the Appendix: Instead of a big push and subsiding finale, ""Last Love Song for Now"" offsets its lyrical gravity and the fresh, raw pain in Sheff's vocals with handclaps and horn charts-- pop devices that turn in on themselves. He repeats the lyrics from ""Missing Children"", but in a different context-- not merely with a faster tempo, but also with a more foreboding gravity that has accrued meaning and significance over these seven songs. This recurrence completes a small cycle that begins with ""Missing Children"", as well as a larger cycle that encompasses the entire Black Sheep Boy project, one that laments the loss of possibilities as lambs become lost rams and children become ""numb"" adults. Okkervil River end ""Last Love Song for Now"" singing ""over and over and over and over"" until Sheff declares, ""It's over."" Whether that's the band's victory cry or an admission of defeat is undeterminable.","Seven tracks that develop ideas suggested on its parent album and introduce some new musical motifs.

At Last: Feedbacker / Sun Baked Snow Cave / Akuma No Uta,BorisMerzbow,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a49d034d5c69bf30ff/1:1/w_160/a3a7df98.jpg,2005-12-13 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11696-at-last-feedbacker-sun-baked-snow-cave-with-merzbow-akuma-no-uta/,Conspiracy,"At one happy point in recent time, it seemed as if the genre division that split loud music into two camps (let's not name names) was going the way of a Japanese club's wall a few seconds before Yamatsuka Eye rode through on a bulldozer. Never mind it turned out to be easier introducing circular saws and flaming projectiles into live music than airlifting the collective brain out of genre ghetto. Some bands, such as Boris-- a Japanese trio with a decade-plus career-- kept it elementary anyway. The titles say it all: From Dronevil and Heavy Rocks to Amplifier Worship and At Last: Feedbacker, sound is the only signifier. That said; they produce a lot of it. In addition to the three releases here, 2005 has seen Boris issue the soundtrack to the film Mabuta No Ura, a couple of DVDs, three archival releases, and another Merzbow collaboration. In March 2006, their latest LP, Pink, will see U.S. release. The equivalent of keeping up is like trying to live with a few stacks of Orange amplifiers turned up and on and around all the time, wild and deafening sound distending itself by the minute. Not to say that Boris doesn't write songs. They do. But in the band's heart, the eternal, eternally fuzzed out and gong-fortified volume jam is more dominant than discrete moments. At Last: Feedbacker is their most effective all-music manifesto. Kindred gear-headed spirits like Sunn0)) and Sleep (both of whom Boris approximately precedes) use long feedback as a portent for ominous and evil things to come; Feedbacker instead makes long drones nonchalant and self-absorbed, mixing up stuttering amplifiers with slow-motion guitar sweeps and wah-drenched solos. At least half of Feedbacker is ""build,"" but it never waits around or anticipates. When, after a while, the rock drumming and huge hits, fuzzed out Sabbath riffs, and laid back, almost-sung vocals show up, it's nearly impossible not to see phantom spotlights shining down onto the speakers. The beauty of Boris is that patience gets rewarded: Ride out long intros, introspective droning, and tonal climbs and the payoff comes 30 feet tall. This is why Sun Baked Snow Cave, the most commercially available of several collaborations with their fellow countryman and sonic heavy hitter Masami Akita (aka Merzbow), is something of a betrayal. The single track never really delivers; a little over midway through, when the four of them are plumbing the low frequencies for an almost Bastard Noise throne-melting, salvation's apparent, but then they pull the curtain back. Pro-forma Merzbow laptop hissing clicks, inert guitar chords, and you're out on your own again. High standards, maybe, but they both do it better elsewhere. So call me conventional, but the first Boris I'm grabbing for at the end of 2005 are the Akuma No Uta Motörhead songs. Where elsewhere they hold back their power, letting it out inch by struggling inch, here it comes on all at once, satisfying every rock/air-guitar urge years of repudiated arena rock might have left unsatisfied. As ""Ibitsu"", the best of the lot, has it: ""No need for forced logic...Want to get ecstasy from this wicked formation/ Deform the sign of retaliation."" The reclamation project that Major Stars put on the loose and hazy 70s rock solo is full-force in Boris too, who work over jet-propelled Lemmyisms into skinny-wimp, freak property. Akuma No Uta is not all aces, but it's close. ""Naki Kyoku"", translated in liner notes as ""Nothingness Song"", wails a little too far past its own wah, and a Boris record is probably the last place you'd like to find the track's frankly emo vocal. But the ride out's right back on track, with the slow-driving ""Ano Onna no Onryo"" smooth as cockiness gets, and ""Akuma No Uta"" ending the record with a blowout display of guitar agility and endless head-nodding.

His Return,Growing,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02a13d197565213b9df/1:1/w_160/e81d6d92.jpg,2005-12-12 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3688-his-return/,Troubleman UnlimitedMegablade,"For the superstitious among us, it is the worst kind of luck to listen to a band you plan to see within 24 hours of their show. Van accidents, band dissolutions, and broken friendships, among other horrors, have supposedly resulted from the transgression. Yet a few weeks ago, on the verge of heading out to watch Growing live, I found myself hitting play on His Return, only hours before they were scheduled to perform. Halfway out the door, I still couldn't figure out what I was leaving to see. A former power trio folded now into a patient duo, Growing practice a kind of mystifying self-effacement. Stacks of amplifiers and big guitar chords hide behind an extreme polish; songs play in a droning shine, with upbeat major chords wrapped around the normally pessimistic avant-garde of feedback meditation. In their original configuration, Growing more often tipped their hand: ""Cutting, Opening, Swimming"", from 2003's The Sky's Run Into the Sea, menaced with drawn-out threats and high volume. Though 2004 saw them already oblique, ""Anaheim II"" (from that year's The Soul of the Rainbow and the Harmony of Light) still puts teeth on edge. His Return, their third and latest full length (not counting an ocean of tapes and archives floating around), never gets that direct, opting instead for a mostly impermeable and effects-laden wall that masks the band's intentions and displaces the amplifiers' murderous impulse. The effect is of being held at arm's length. ""In the Shadow of the Mountain"" is a tease, a trembling line of fluted guitar and static drone, checking bagpipes at both ends of the spectrum; though it meanders, it never quite arrives. The sound is at once soothing and superficial. ""Freedom Towards Death"" is not so removed but it too dances around the point. Growing bring out a rare vocal and do it full-up, overdubs and everything: each phrase proceeds apace, and although it's catchy, there's more than a hint of metronome to the pace. The steady evenness reads as programmatic or mechanical as it does generous. The palette over these long songs is pretty sparse, and the best part of His Return is when they embrace their own set limits and use the time to shove just one sound into one space. ""Wide Open"", the most fully realized track, is actually its nominal opposite, mercifully foregoing the gradual changes and shiny shallow reflection. Growing pour on one grinding chord, one melody, and with the two build a huge and thrilling edifice. But the overall schematics of the thing are defeating, and one doesn't need to love guitars or dissonance to wish they would stroke harder or not all.","Now a duo, the band hides stacks of amplifiers and big guitar chords behind an extreme polish.

Downtown Science,Blockhead,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44f13d1975652138ca7/1:1/w_160/0ed0d46f.jpg,2005-12-12 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1105-downtown-science/,Ninja Tune,"As a relatively sedate instrumental album with plodding drums and dark atmospherics, Blockhead's second solo album, Downtown Science, isn't much different from his first. While it's status quo for Blockhead, the most lasting details on the album might be the most incidental ones. Over the heavy boom-bap and reverberating bass of the DJ Shadow-lite opener ""Expiration Date"", there's a sample of a male vocal who laments how commonplace heartbreak is, singing ""probably hundreds of wonderful love affairs go bad in this town every week,"" and then, almost inaudibly, ""...it's a big town."" ""Expiration Date"" is something of a false start, and the record finds its feet on ""Roll out the Red Carpet"". Blockhead is less a hot beat factory than a subtle idea man, and the track is crammed with them: tweaked female choruses and sweeping strings cribbed from Daedelus's playbook bump against tribunal-worthy horns and fluid, shifting drums; the all-too-brief ""Serenade"" marries harp flourishes with dirty electric piano and a swaying, handclap-driven beat. From there, it's a long, moody plain until the stop-start drums of ""Stop Motion Traffic"", the filthy funk of ""The Art of Walking"" anchored by an excellent bass line, and the crashing hyper-compressed guitar chords of the dynamic ""Good Block Bad Block"". The pacing is an improvement from his debut, but it's rare that Blockhead pulls the trigger and builds a really quirky or unique soundscape that he's capable of, just scraping the surface on the aforementioned tracks or the junkyard jazz of ""Dough Nation"". ""Roll Out the Red Carpet"" opens with a courting couple from an antiquated musical, planning to meet in Washington Square, and the manic comedian sampled in ""Good Block Bad Block"" could just as likely be describing hometown geography (""good block, bad block/gun block, crack block"") instead of a nod to his DJ handle, and amidst the final stunner ""Long Walk Home"", a man sings out ""I've been terribly alone/ And forgotten old Manhattan."" A unifying theme could have elevated this album above other instrumental hip-hop-- and above Blockhead's own solo work-- but he's content to use the snippets as segues, which is a shame. Downtown Science could have been a sleek limousine ride through Blockhead's version of New York, but we'll have to settle for an appropriately funky cab ride.","Relatively sedate instrumental hip-hop from Ninja Tune.

Lost Horizon,Friends of Dean Martinez,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be33ea9e61561daa7876/1:1/w_160/3999862a.jpg,2005-12-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3206-lost-horizon/,Aero,"Writing a review of Friends of Dean Martinez without mentioning the desert is like writing a book without the letter ""e""-- it can be done, but it's difficult and time-consuming. Ernest Vincent Wright accomplished the latter feat back in 1939 with his epic lipogram Gadsby, and it took him about five months, whereas I just caved instantly to my basest critical instincts. Really though, discussing music, especially instrumental music, in environmental terms is a pretty good way to get a point across, so let's get it on: this band's music has always conjured wide-open, arid spaces, in scorching daylight and frigid night time alike. And their latest album, Lost Horizon, finds them still exploring familiar environs. The album also continues another FODM album trend: each is darker than the last. Various organs hum quietly in support of the searching guitars of Bill Elm and Mike Semple, and brushed drum beats fall like boots on hard-blown sand. Guitars have always been king amongst the Friends, but the playing here is especially intense and fluid, with uniformly impeccable phrasing. These guys are accomplished musicians, and the music is stuffed with emotional longing and heated crescendos. A soft, humming drone opens the album, and a stunning guitar lead drops in on top of it, wandering only slightly distorted in a galaxy-sized echo chamber, finally reaching its climax over a thumping, tumbling drum beat as notes fall from the guitar like light from a sparkler. The band picks up the pace a few tracks later on ""Heart of Darkness"" with an unusually fractured drum break, topped by ferocious, almost raga-like guitar and a subtly employed choir sound on either a mellotron or a chamberlain. The pace doesn't stay quick for long, though-- the album is centered by two gorgeous slow tracks that give off melodies like waves of heat on a horizon. Sumptuous beauty is the main ingredient in most of the rest of the album, though ""Hidden Out of Sight"" does provide one last hurrah for feedback and heavy fuzz. The acoustic guitar-dominated songs that surround it play more readily to the band's strengths and have a wider dynamic range, building up and breaking down with natural ease. That same natural ease is a part of what makes Friends of Dean Martinez so compelling-- they play sophisticated music, but they let it develop organically, at whatever pace seems right. In this case, they've developed yet another excellent album of beautifully arid music.","On its sixth album the indie pop band explores wide-open, arid spaces and increasingly darker territory.

It Fit When I Was a Kid EP,Liars,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf4abf31b7dc7155e38/1:1/w_160/9be298e6.gif,2005-12-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4766-it-fit-when-i-was-a-kid-ep/,Mute,"Overall, Liars deserve an award for most improved Williamsburg neo no-wave band. I used to think the Brooklyn-to-Berlin group was an obnoxious snoreful, but on last year's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned the boys unveiled a stirring drone-o-rific direction. At the time, those expecting more of the same-old panned the collection, and since that time the resentment has seemingly deepened. Ignoring these unadventurous critics, It Fit When I Was a Kid, a four-song EP, finds the trio of Angus Andrew, Aaron Hemphill, and Julian Gross trudging in a similar direction, perhaps with less punch in the percussion. But then, it's impossible to guess whether this single is indicative of the band's forthcoming full-length, Drum's Not Dead-- it just doesn't give us much to chew on. The EP's contents are the title track and its technocrat remix, plus two minimalist non-album pieces, and low-budget videos for the three non-remix tracks. (The 7"" contains the title track and its remix.) From its timing to its packaging, the thing's an obvious stocking stuffer (check cupid-struck Santa on the back, crossed candy canes, sliced fruitcake) and its made-for-collectors censored gay-porn cover art PhotoShopped by Julian Gross will get more press than it deserves. Such is the general reaction to penises. If you want to see it uncensored, you can get a full art cover on edible paper from the band's website. Musically, the lead track's a deep-space sea of vocal drone and plodding drums. Andrew's voice echoes, and occasionally his intonation-- ""We were walking in the snow/ Down the street from your front door/ I jumped the neighbors' fence at dawn/ Danced my way across your lawn"" -- lands in the area of newest A.R.E. Weapons single, ""Weakest Ones"". Only, this doesn't suck. Actually, for its seeming tepidness, it's somehow addictive. The sound of a malleted diamond has us thinking of ""crystals flying everywhere."" A spooky organ introduces the song's shadowy lumen-tree half led by Turkish delight falsetto. It's murkily seamless and understated, and denser than it appears on a first or second listen: A Christmas carol for the restless dead? The considerably rockier ""The Frozen Glacier Of Mastodon Blood"" lacks the opener's fluidity, though the Big Black-style drums are nice. ""Bingo! Count Draculuck"" turns up the echo for a repeated query, ""Are you all right?""-- its ambient drone, factory-dub percussion, and video game blasts are ultimately nondescript. Finally, ""It Fit When I Was a Kid (Don't Techno For An Answer)"" fractures the original then dumps thump-thump-thump atop, burying things in 12 inches of snow. This nibble has me intrigued, but also kinda bored (again). I'm hoping Liars lodge a few more pieces like ""It Fit When I Was a Kid"" on the LP; if the supporting tracks are an indication, though, there's reason to nod off. Going with my gut, those lesser tracks ring more like filler than future promises, so let's keep faith and expect Drum's Not Dead to offer something sublime.","Four-track, three-video EP from the unfairly maligned Brooklyn-to-Berlin group.

Walking With a Ghost EP,The White Stripes,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa1b13d197565213999a/1:1/w_160/e100ff7a.gif,2005-12-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8654-walking-with-a-ghost-ep/,V2,"The White Stripes have always shown a tasteful appreciation for the traditional construction of the single, giving their fans a healthy selection of non-album B-sides and import-only bonus tracks to hunt down. So it seems an uncharacteristic misjudgment for them to headline this brief collection with their cover of Tegan and Sara's ""Walking With a Ghost"", a track that seems exactly the sort of likable but inconsequential bauble tailor-made for a B-side. Produced with an impulsive haste that is fast becoming one of the duo's hallmarks, this genial cover sounds singularly unpersuasive, a performance unlikely to challenge anyone's previously held opinions about the Stripes, Tegan and Sara, walking, or ghosts. Although one can only speculate what exactly prompted Jack and Meg to cover ""Walking With a Ghost"", they do handle the song with a tangible affection-- despite what some Tegan and Sara connoisseurs might believe. In fact, the Stripes' version is almost reverential to fault, making it difficult to imagine a fan of the original disliking this too intensely, unless they simply object to Jack White's complexion or personal habits just on general principle. Likewise, those who find Tegan & Sara's skeletal brand of winsome Canadian pop to be unbearably trite and/or mundane will presumably remain unswayed by the White Stripes' modest Detroit upgrade. Tegan and Sara's original has a slight build even by the White Stripes' rudimentary standards, and Jack's conversion of the guitars from acoustic to electric does little to heft it up. His reedy, double-tracked vocals match Tegan and Sara's phrasing almost exactly, injecting as much spirit as possible into their blank, repetitive non-sequiters like ""I was walking with a ghost/ I said please, please don't insist."" And Meg, needless to say, sounds well within her comfort zone, managing the song's elementary rhythm with aplomb. The twosome add a brief squiggle of guitar distortion and back-masking between choruses, but for better or worse decline the opportunity to expand this noisy interjection into a full-scale deconstruction. The quality of the extras and B-sides accompanying the Get Behind Me Satan singles has run the gamut. Their stormy, Hendrixian cover of the Greenhorns' ""Shelter of My Arms"", a recent B-side to ""The Denial Twist"", deserves to be considered alongside the duo's best work, while the ""Blue Orchid"" flipside ""Who's a Big Baby?"" might arguably be the most worthless track released this year. For Walking With a Ghost, however, they've killed the suspense by padding the maxi-single out with four live versions of previously available album tracks. Since the duo rarely add much in the way of polish to their studio productions, they are uniquely well-suited to the live recording format, and none of these live tracks differ drastically from their studio counterparts. The set's best track is an acoustic version of ""Same Boy You've Always Known"" recorded in Brazil that actually features a more refined vocal performance than appears on White Blood Cells, provided you're able to ignore the audience's slightly arrhythmic clap-along. Live renditions of ""As Ugly As I Seem"" and ""The Denial Twist"", both recorded for KCRW's ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"", remain faithful to the Get Behind Me Satan originals and will likely only appeal to the truly devoted, which could also be said for their barn-burning run-through of their debut album's ""Screwdriver"". As Walking With a Ghost lacks a genuine slam-dunk A-side, most listeners might be best served to just hold off entirely for now, saving attention for the inevitable lavish collection of White Stripes B-sides and rarities that's surely bound to appear sometime within the next couple holiday seasons.","Jack and Meg White cover Tegan and Sara, and add a handful of live tracks to pad out this stocking stuffer.

This Is Stunt Rock Volume Three,Stunt Rock,by: Cory D.

Shows by his former band, Meat, were as much performance art as rock concerts, as this modern day GG Allin would do everything from carving his flesh with razor blades to drinking his own urine. It's this same sort of disregard for wholesome entertainment that fuels the music on This Is Stunt Rock Volume Three, his latest album under the Stunt Rock moniker. Layers of samples from every imaginable musical genre, programmed beats, and snippets from movies and television create a mish-mash of electronic party music that's just as likely to make you laugh as dance. The 16 seamless songs are essentially without titles. The accompanying booklet refers to each as simply ""Audio Selection Number One"" through ""Audio Selection Number Sixteen"", and a table of contents lists the page for the lyrics for each selection. As a de facto title, each song has a quote assigned to it that offers insight into the track itself, Flagel's opinion of the music he's created, or a simple blast of self deprecation. A sample, from what we'll refer to as ""Audio Selection Number Five"", reads, ""I will make up for a lifetime of fucking chicks poorly by having the most diverse CD collection in the world."" The center of the booklet features 12 ""Life Achievement Badges"", each with a description. The badges cover things like mortgage, female shapes, smoking, and masturbation. If all of this sounds a little pretentious, it is, but Flagel makes it clear that little of what is contained on this record is meant to be taken seriously. The very fact that a lyric sheet is included is impressive, since all of the lyrics are samples. The subject matter is often aimed at mankind's futility and weakness, whether mocking those who feign revolutionary while seeming to live solely for the purpose of consuming (""Audio Selection Number Four""), or painting a portrait of teenage rage-filled apathy (""Audio Selection Number Five""). In addition, there are enough bawdy one-liners here to make Sarah Silverman blush. The disc's various rants come from a wide variety of speakers, including Axl Rose, Bruce McCulloch, and Anton Newcombe, among others, but as with many sample-based, mash-up discs, part of the fun is trying to identify the source material. The music samples are just as varied. Bizarre showtunes sidle up next to funky bass lines; heavy-metal guitars blast behind horns and chopped up dance beats. The sources range from Public Enemy to the Dead Milkmen, and there's plenty of soft rock, 1980s metal, and old- school soul thrown in for good measure. The final product is a dizzying dance record where Stunt Rock places an equal emphasis on both the stunt and the rock, never pushing either over the limit.","Sixteen seamless, bizarrely titled pieces from William Flegal.

This Is Where Our Hearts Collide,Amandine,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d39d034d5c69bf2a50/1:1/w_160/cbc625ee.jpg,2005-12-11 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/493-this-is-where-our-hearts-collide/,Fat Cat,"The geography of Sweden is rolling, majestic, and surprisingly diverse. The subarctic north imposes with its icy grandeur; near Stockholm a national park sprawls over 300-year-old virgin forest. The south is typically temperate. So too Amandine's spacious folk-pop, which like its place of origin is probably slightly bigger than California-- and provides a higher standard of living than good ol' Bushworld by most measures. On This Is Where Our Hearts Collide, Amandine roam across a vast and chilly plain, tumbling guitars and graceful bearing aligning them with the windswept Americana of Sun Kil Moon, Songs:Ohia, or pre-Z My Morning Jacket. The arrangements are spare yet sky-wide, occasionally visited by banjos, accordions, glockenspiels, and theremin. ""Stitches"" emerges from the previous track's halting piano to survey the tundra with crunching Neil Young licks and mournful, distant trumpet. Yet singer Olof Gidlöf's trembling whisper and easy sense of pop melody evoke a comfortable, hypothetical Sam Beam-Ben Gibbard collab. Gentle love song ""Easy Prey"" traces an elegant extended metaphor over a twirling arpeggio, Gidlöf sighing, ""With your paws upon my chest/ I'll be calm."" Boundless horizons meet the intimate under uneasy harmonies. Meanwhile, even the most cinematic ballads smolder with weary sadness. The album title suggests emo, but the heartbreak is more permanent, without that genre's too-common petulance. ""How much can you ask for before I start letting you down,"" goes the warm, stately chorus of ""Fine Lines"". After a lazy banjo intro, Gidlöf continues an unbearably lonely conversation -- ""And we fell apart/ Like fathers and sons"" -- on ""Fathers & Sons"". ""Firefly"" opens with a buzzing acoustic guitar rhythm out of Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" and plays the weeping-violins card nicely, aided by intertwined falsetto vocals and left-behind drums. ""If it stings, it stings because it's true,"" Gidlöf sings. All in all, it's possibly what you'd hope for from a group of Swedes who originally called themselves Wichita Linemen, but more than you could expect.

Flags of the Sacred Harp,Jackie-O Motherfucker,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bb5e6ef95969322a2a/1:1/w_160/49d38e0f.jpg,2005-12-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4191-flags-of-the-sacred-harp/,ATP,"The Sacred Harp is the title of an American songbook first published in 1844 that collected hundreds of traditional hymns and anthems dating back to Colonial times. Passed down by oral tradition, these polyphonic songs were meant to be sung a cappella by choirs, and were written using a unique four shape-note notation. This simplified manner of notation was created to encourage active participation, emphasizing an inclusive sense of community over performance. For their fifth album Flags of the Sacred Harp, the Portland-based collective Jackie-O Motherfucker use the lessons of The Sacred Harp and other traditional blues and gospel sources as a point of disembarkation. On these seven tracks, the group patiently unravel their source material's tangled threads, respooling them into wondrously evocative yet deeply personalized new devotionals. Over the course of their now decade-plus career, J-OMF have often incorporated American folkloric material into their free-form experiments, most memorably on 2000's Fig. 5, which included reconfigured versions of the traditional hymns ""Go Down, Old Hannah"" and ""Amazing Grace"". On Flags of the Sacred Harp, however, the group has more fully internalized and distilled the grammar of its blues and gospel influences, so that throughout the album identifiable scraps of melody or lyrics continually surface then re-submerge into the music's bubbling depths. And though the album was over a year in the making, there is nothing labored in the group's delivery. Each of these extended, luminous pieces issues forth with an unhurried grace as though simply tapped from an already existent wellspring. Throughout the group's lifespan, Jackie-O Motherfucker has undergone several personnel shifts, and is here pared to a quartet that includes founder Tom Greenwood, Nudge vocalist Honey Owens, and guitarist Adam Forkner, who has also played with Yume Bitsu and Devendra Banhart. But as with traditional Sacred Harp singing, the emphasis here is on group interplay and exploration rather than individual voices. Gentle opener ""Nice One"", though not a cappella, commences with Greenwood and Owens locked in a mesmeric vocal roundelay, before radiant amp feedback and cymbal swirls gradually permit the song's structure to loosen particle by particle. In contrast, the following ""Rockaway"" is as straightforward a country blues as the group have ever cut, with lyrics (""tombstone is my pillow/ graveyard's gonna be my bed"") that allude to Blind Willie McTell's ""Death Room Blues"", among other folk blues classics. ""Hey Mr. Sky"" does the same for Charley Patton's ""Pony Blues"", although the words are carried heavenward by a full armload of rippling acid guitar. Standing center is the 16-minute sculpted drone of ""Spirits"", a steadily ascendant instrumental excursion that contains the album's least overt traditional references, conducting its worship instead through cryptic ceremony and unmoored electricity. As the album progresses, however, the skies grow increasingly darker, with tracks like ""Good Morning Kaptain"" and ""The Louder Roared The Sea"" recasting the language of the hymnal to express a vague, encroaching dread rather than faith. Yet still the group's music-- a mass of splintered guitar, percussion, harmonica, and indistinct voices-- remains faithfully reliant on congregational unity, and as result Flags of the Sacred Harp stands as Jackie-O Motherfucker's most potent and focused liturgy to date.","Portland-based collective builds on the lessons of The Sacred Harp and other traditional blues and gospel sources on this evocative yet deeply personal LP.

Life and Live,Xiu Xiu,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad213d1975652139adc/1:1/w_160/af6595f7.jpg,2005-12-11 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8829-life-and-live/,Xeng,"At last summer's Pitchfork-curated Intonation Festival in Chicago's Union Park, Xiu Xiu stuck out like sore thumb amid more no-doy outdoor-fest-ready groups like the Hold Steady and Out Hud. Xiu Xiu's music is not intended for open, sunny spaces; it's like a vampire in a tanning salon. Then again, Jamie Stewart isn't the sallow-cheeked ghoul you might imagine him to be based on his relentlessly in-bent, harrowingly sad songs-- he's clean-cut, handsome, pretty buff. The disconnect between his robust frame and sickly music mirrors the tension in the songs themselves, between quivering ephemera and hulking clangor. What really came clear at Intonation, watching Stewart and Caralee McElroy inflict violence on the air, was that Xiu Xiu's music is a music of intrusions. As Stewart quietly gasped over sonorous mandolin lines, McElroy introduced discord in the form of crashing gamelans and broken-glass synths, chaotic interruptions that seemed to come from outside of the music, to assault it. Life and Live, a collection of 15 solo, often acoustic performances culled from a tour with Devendra Banhart, gives us a different Xiu Xiu, one that must rely entirely on Stewart's voice and guitar without McElroy around to drop heavy ordnance on the periphery. As such, the album shrinks to a white-hot pinpoint, radiating out with grim placidity from that raw place from which Stewart projects his demons. The songs, drawing most heavily from Xiu Xiu's pre-Fabulous Muscles albums, are spare to the point of obliteration, unfolding in glittering dreamtime. They build themselves slowly, one piece at a time-- a splintered chord coalesces and diffuses like smoke; a richly emotive syllable or injured yelp hangs suspended in the thick silence in its wake-- draped loosely on rickety frames. The instances of dissonance emerge from within the songs, not from without, sealing off and pressurizing them. If Xiu Xiu's songs usually evince a struggle between penetrating quietude and untamed energy, on Life and Live Stewart proves that he's equally adept at each. The two versions of ""I Broke Up"" cleave it along that axis; the first is a prayerful acoustic ballad, the second a plugged-in tantrum that boils up over the rim in its stormy middle section. Less revealing are the two versions of ""20,000 Deaths for Eidelyn Gonzales, 20,000 Deaths for Jamie Peterson"", which are too similarly performed to really justify the inclusion of both. The ripped, hollow chords of ""Jennifer Lopez"" and the gibbering exclamations of ""Sad Pony Guerilla Girl"" strike jarring contrasts to the inexorable pull of Smiths cover ""Asleep"" and the creeping ""Helsabot"", but such outbursts are rare enough to preserve the record's hypnotic intimacy. Life and Live proves that while the superficial difficulty of Xiu Xiu's music might be tacked on, its essential intensity comes from Stewart himself. Here, he's at his most hermetic and obscure, a long intake of breath that pulls in and in but never exhales.","Live album collects 15 solo, often acoustic performances culled from a tour with Devendra Banhart.

Guerolito,Beck,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2525e6ef959693203b9/1:1/w_160/5b71588c.jpg,2005-12-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/622-guerolito/,Interscope,"Beck's eyes are preternaturally blue, and until recently, exactly what lay behind them was something of an enigma. Whether clowning in videos, spontaneously breakdancing at awards shows, or just gazing ahead on his album covers, the junkyard boho was always looking beyond, seemingly into a bizarre realm unhindered by genre-- or behavioral-- expectations. But lately, he just looks lost. Wandering down a gimmicky path lined with empty pop-up confections in the ""Girl"" video, the 35-year-old dad with bad hair found himself relegated to the role of passerby. More than ever, 2005 saw Beck losing his edge. So, on this take two, he embraces the talent and ideas of contemporaries and descendants alike (all of whom, I'm sure, are really, really nice), hoping for a little friendly friction. Much like its inconsistent source material, Guerolito emits a few flashes but lacks the cohesiveness that was once this innovator's hallmark. Possibly a sign of self-conscious second-guessing, Beck began to commission new mixes for Guero early on. Oddly, the lo-fi blip GameBoy Variations EP, featuring remixes for four of the album's songs, was thrown up online a full two months before Guero's official release. Then, over the course of the year, about a half-dozen more trickled out. Wisely, not all of these previously released alternates-- including lazy efforts from Dizzee Rascal and Röyksopp-- are included here. All in all, nine of Guerolito's 14 tracks are new, which, along with fresh artwork courtesy of surrealist Guero cover illustrator Marcel Dzama, and a track-for-track sequencing, indicates the intention of a true remix album rather than just another careless fourth-quarter hodge-podge ch-ching. While such efforts are duly noted, the bare-bones liners and widely varying quality of these retries make Guerolito better suited for iTunes cherry-picking than full-on Amazon consumption. Several tracks equal or trump their initial incarnations by emphasizing pluses and playing into their remixers' entrenched strengths. Both Boards of Canada and Air are wonderfully type-cast; the former's take on ""Broken Drum"" highlights Beck's Sea Change-y lonesome vocals with apropos amble ambience while the latter's ""Missing"" redux, ""Heaven Hammer"", boosts sexy-church synths, echoing drums, and everything else you'd expect from France's finest purveyors of cheesy-cool. The new ""Scarecrow"", courtesy of El-P, is a marked improvement on its predecessor, with the hip-hop producer's succinct drums and keyboard stabs giving the song a newfound strut. Meanwhile, golden boy Diplo reiterates his current crate-king status by slowing down the staccato bass backbone of the English Beat's ""Twist and Crawl"" to provide his ""Go It Alone"" redo with a stealth funk. Alas, many other attempts fall flat due to weak, repetitive arrangements, or an inability to convincingly congeal with their forebears. The worst offender is nerd rap group Subtle, whose lumbering ""Farewell Ride"" won't entice anybody to grab onto the Anticon trolley anytime soon. (I hope.) Two ex-Unicorn projects are represented, and neither clicks, though for different reasons; Islands' Uni-lite twee instrumentation sounds woefully out of place when meshed with Beck's East L.A. non-sequiturs on ""Que Onda Guero"" (not to mention the ill-fated, half-assed screwed 'n' chopped bit), while Th' Corn Gangg's electro R2-D2 spin on ""Emergency Exit"" takes too long to climax with its dense thump and cut-up vox. And just when you thought the Beasties couldn't get more annoying, Adrock comes along with his throwback minimalist-clang take on ""Black Tambourine"" featuring enough repeating ""ugh!"" and ""what!"" drops to make you want to steamroll your copy of Check Your Head. His fierce glint fading, it's becoming increasingly clear that Beck is no longer able to freely revel in the youthful dalliances that made him famous more than a decade ago. Guerlito's standouts prove that proper taste and a good ear can be just as valuable as songwriting to a multi-tasker like Beck, but even for an artist this venerable, a remix record is still a remix record-- generally uneven, part enlightening, and part skippable.","Track-by-track Guero remix album features nine previously unreleased mixes and contributions from Air, Boards of Canada, Diplo, Islands, and El-P, among others.

On the Outside,Starsailor,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a552c0084474cd0c06bf/1:1/w_160/65609a21.jpg,2005-12-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7481-on-the-outside/,EMI,"I'm still waiting for some wink or tongue-implanted cheek revealing that the stakes in Starsailor's maudlin utopian message aren't so high. Sure, immaculately sly Art Brut scene-skewering would be unreasonable, but these guys can't possibly believe, as their debut suggests, that ""love is here."" The other day on the subway some snot-nosed preschooler gave me the finger, for crying out loud! But hey, Starsailor were in their early 20s when they thanked goodness for the good souls. Four years and two albums later, the more world-weary quartet now shares an ethos only Staind could possibly articulate: they're On the Outside. Like every jerk who reads an Orwell or Rand novel and walks around a few days with a chip on his/her shoulder, Starsailor play the self-righteous yet simplistic social critic. Beck and Elliott Smith producer Rob Schnapf is behind the boards on this one, and it's likely his easiest gig yet. Starsailor shies away from riffs, tempo changes and even syncopation, leaving Schnapf to whittle each song into a ""Speed of Sound"" offshoot. Such bland instrumentation only places frontman James Walsh higher on his pedestal, and unfortunately, he's ready to give everyone a 40-minute piece of his mind. Opener ""In the Crossfire"" wrestles with the age-old issue of dealing with fame, though Walsh conjures up more images of the Milton Bradley board game commercials than the ""crossfire"" between his private life and fame. Walsh's solution to this problem? Try the faith, hope and love on the track ""Faith Hope Love"". Walsh opines about ""this modern world,"" offering the three title tenets as panaceas. Problem is, if the ""plastic society"" in ""Get Out While You Can"" irks Walsh so deeply, why does his band constantly cash in on its Coldplay likeness and leather-jacket, mop-top boy image? Of course, when the highfalutin ideology falters, Walsh always has his big guns--love and oddly optimistic heartbreak. ""This Time"" is vintage Chris Martin down to the fey piano lines and lithe verse/sweeping chorus dynamic, and on ""Keep Us Together"", Walsh manages to both snipe at Americana and butter up his honey: ""Folks in California can't live without their son/ They've actor politicians to infiltrate their young...The bitter the taste when they don't deliver/ Will keep us together."" You don't need Dr. Phil to point out the crazy in that relationship, and it's the grave, misplaced emotions like these that ultimately sink an otherwise innocuous band.","Former NME hypes, still plugging along.

What the Game's Been Missing!,Juelz Santana,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63f5e6ef95969320cb9/1:1/w_160/6b1e76d2.jpg,2005-12-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7713-what-the-games-been-missing/,Def Jam,"When he appeared three years ago on Cam'ron's ""Hey Ma"", Juelz Santana actually sounded older than he does today, stretching his naturally spiky voice to fit the reclining, piano-driven beat. Copping good ""dome"" his club night ne plus ultra, Santana's fledgling audacity shone clear: ""I'm 18 and live a crazy life"" hardly prohibited ""Get in the car/ Don't touch nothin', sit in the car."" I guess you could say he's grown: What the Game's Been Missing! woos dope boys, not fastidious females. Ask Young Jeezy, such is the fashion. Santana talks coke with a sentimental drift. On ""Rumble Young Man Rumble"", it's toast-worthy (""To the good days, to the bad days/ To the good yay', to the bad yay'""); on ""Oh Yes"", lamentable (""I'm back/ I'm crack/ Sorry 'bout that""). Nowhere on this trap-happy album is Santana's pocket full of stones more pivotal than in ""Lil' Boy Fresh"", which details a S\xFBze-esque set-up (""You should've seen the look on Jose's face""), nowhere soupier than in the otherwise squeaky-clean ""Good Times"": ""Those were the good ol' days/ Every hustler had good cocaine."" Jeezy invokes community in his pusher raps-- no matter how hard, a hustler is never above helping his hood. But Santana is so heels-over-head smitten with his product, one wonders if people even factor on his radar. He embodies coke: A daisychain of wildly entertaining summer mixtapes wore the rapper's audacious moniker, Human Crack in the Flesh. The series yielded a number of underground hits, including ""Mic Check"" and ""There It Go (The Whistle Song)"". Both here and on his mixtapes, Santana delivers simple phrases with enough oomph to break a dinosaur rib cage. He's a master minimalist who can take a single word and make a song of it. Few MCs say more with so little, and Santana compensates for what he lacks of Cam's 3D-goggled imagism or Jeezy's raze-the-block charisma with a knotty, nunchucking delivery style that's half flow, half helicopter. Santana's staccato spit makes ideal rhythm-play. Beats aren't foundations but running ropes, designed to test agility. On ""Oh Yes"" he jukes the Marvelettes' ""Please Mr. Postman"", recalling a young Cam's snappy ""Oh Boy"". Although he was weaned on the Dipset aesthetic, which favors cutting strings and tamped-down drums, Santana excels at navigating the vacuous spaces in starkly unadorned beats. Time and time again, he fashions a soft spot in inflexible bedrock. On ""Clockwork"" he creeps over hollowed-out string trill and noisome synth fuzz, working the titular metaphor into pretty much every line. Lyrically staid next to Cam's fantastical scrolls, Juelz dazzles by dint of sound. He rhymes words with themselves (""Whatever U Wanna Call It"" simply keeps ""business, business/ pleasure, pleasure,"" and never mixes the two, ""ever, ever""), beats cadences to a pulp like the Ying Yang Twins' favorite topic, and truncates lines as if he's ducking the oncoming kicks. When Sensitive Juelz proclaims his shit ""the realest I ever wrote"" on token lament-to-self ""This Is Me"", you'll sashay next door to ""Make It Work For You""'s crumbling corner real estate, much truer; when Hell Rell grumbles over roto-toms and drear piano twinkle on ""Whatever U Wanna Call It"", you'll commend Santana for flying solo on heat like ""Gangsta Shit"" (""Hi, my name is / Deeeeez nuts!""). But the holes are more Alpine Lace than Emmentaler. Barely 21, Santana might as well have his head in the font, and he conserves words as if poised for a long race.","Dipset member's latest studio album features highlights from his Back Like Cooked Crack mixtape series, plus previously unreleased material.

Blurred in My Mirror,Tujiko Noriko,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c428ea9e61561daa80ad/1:1/w_160/5e99b352.gif,2005-12-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5836-blurred-in-my-mirror/,Room40,"When does food stop being food? Is it when you chew it? When you swallow it? Is it later, as it's broken up by your body's digestive system? It's an interesting question, one that probably has no answer, or perhaps has several that are equally correct. It came to mind as I listened to ""I'm Not Dreaming, King"" from Japanese electronic experimentalist Tujiko Noriko's Blurred in My Mirror. The track is the sound of a conventional song being eaten by electronic noise, swallowed and broken up into proteins and enzymes. Noriko's frail voice sings a wandering melody as guitar, saxophone, and drums kick up dusty texture below her, threatening to congeal into rhythm and metered chord changes, but never quite doing it. Australian Lawrence English's electronics coat the whole thing in a patina of slow breakdown, piercing with high-pitched whines and ultimately gobbling up the song's conclusion. It poses the question: When does a song stop being a song and start being something else, say, a noise sculpture? Blurred in My Mirror is Noriko's sixth album, and it spends a lot of time in this gray territory, pop enough that it's emotionally resonant and musically memorable, but avant garde enough that it challenges your musical expectations and refuses to take easy paths. ""Tennisplayer Makes a Smile"" stretches pop ingredients even further than ""I'm Not Dreaming, King"", pulling Noriko's sung Japanese phrases like taffy into long, amorphous suggestions of melody as acoustic guitar plucks along unmolested by processing or glitch. Meanwhile, muffled drums lurk just on the edges, kept buried but threatening by English's electronic manipulations. Noriko speaks in English on opener ""Niagara Hospital"" before switching to Japanese, and her measured, almost casual manner of describing simple happiness when her boyfriend visits her at the hospital is disarming. A deep, squelching beat suffused with vibes and marimba stutters behind her, balancing the simple innocence of her words with skin-prickling menace. The payoff lyrically comes with surreal images of a dancing doctor and her suspicions that she is losing her memory. ""Tablet for Memory"" and ""Shayou (Setting Sun)"" are the most overtly song-oriented pieces on the record, with the former essentially an electronically generated slice of psychedelia. ""Shayou"" rides a complex beat riddled with sub-bass sine waves and clipped percussion, while Noriko doubles up her vocals on dramatic melodic phrases, suggesting a sort of alternate-universe Björk. Blurred in My Mirror is an intriguing record that, while clearly not aiming to be pop, or even especially accessible, nonetheless possesses a few truly transcendent moments. More than simply exploration or experimentation, the album manages a measure of magic when it rests right at the nexus point of song and sculpture, pop and experiment. When does food stop being food? The answer doesn't matter so long as you're nourished.","Japanese singer's sixth album blends the emotional resonance of pop with the challenges of the avant garde.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 3: 1963",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a837b1335d7bf1699222/1:1/w_160/de3a5123.gif,2005-12-08 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2066-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-3-1963/,Hip-O Select,"It's 9:05 on a Friday morning sometime in 1963, and Berry Gordy locks the door. The Hitsville, USA product evaluation committee is in session, and if you've shown up late, tough luck. Wait until next Friday. During the meeting, Motown employees from both the creative and business sides frankly evaluate everything demoed during the week and either approve it for release or send it back. Motown in 1963 was firing on all cylinders-- the business ran smoothly and the music was hot. By the end of the year, Gordy's operation sent 10 songs into the pop top ten and had laid the groundwork for 1964, the year the Motor City went supernova. 1963 was the year of Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech (released on a Motown LP), and the Great March on Washington in August brought the Civil Rights movement to one of its greatest crescendos. The year also saw the graduation of James Meredith, the first black man to attend the University of Mississippi, the horrific bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, all against the backdrop of escalation in Vietnam. Despite the chaotic environment, the music on the third volume of Hip-O Select's ongoing Complete Motown Singles collection is absurdly consistent. Hitsville's A & B sides from that year fill five CDs, and judging from the whole, most of those Friday morning meetings must have been full of good cheer. Among the year's great milestones was the formation of the mighty writing/production team of Holland/Dozier/Holland, whose guidance resulted in the development of that signature Motown stomp that would reap such great creative (and financial) rewards. In fact, over the course of this set, you can hear the percussive accents slowly moving from just the second and fourth beats to all four beats. While Eddie Holland remained a mystifyingly slept-on performer in his own right (check the amazing Northern Soul classic ""Leaving Here""), his real legacy lay in his collaborations with Lamont Dozier and brother Brian-- and one listen to Martha & the Vandellas' massive smash ""Heat Wave"" shoves their collective genius straight up your face. Yet, it was on an earlier Vandellas track, ""Come and Get These Memories"", that the trio truly established their widescreen vision, transforming a clever post-break-up lyric into an exhilarating wall of sound. Also coming up in 1963 was ""Little"" Stevie Wonder, who became the first Motown artist to simultaneously top the album and single charts-- and this at the age of 12. Ever conscious of how his output was performing in the marketplace, Gordy took note that several radio DJs across the country had latched on to the B-side of Wonder's ""Fingertips"" single, a live recording that actually featured a prominent mistake. When that recording was made, Wonder had yet to have a hit, but he performed with a manic energy befitting his age, and after extending a monster take on ""Fingertips"" at a Motown revue, he snuck back on stage for an encore, much to the crowd's delight. The next band was setting up, and bassist Joe Swift can clearly be heard shouting ""What key?"" Sensing that audiences were latching on to the spontaneity, Gordy astutely reissued the recording with the sides reversed and Swift's panicked query mixed as high as he could get it. It landed four-square atop the chart, dragging the accompanying album right along with it. The ""Fingertips"" scenario is emblematic of how efficient Motown had become at managing distribution and taking advantage of regional success. What still wasn't paying off, though, were the label's offshoots: Gordy believed diversification was a good way of hedging financial bets, and as on this series' previous two volumes, a few head-scratching experiments rear up. His love of jazz stretched back more than a decade-- he even had a failed record shop devoted to it-- so his establishment of the Workshop Jazz imprint makes a certain amount of artistic sense. The label only functioned during 1963, serving largely as an outlet for assorted Funk Brothers to stretch out, but the music was probably too conservative to leave much of a mark on a jazz world already split wide open by Sketches of Spain and Free Jazz. Gordy's Divinity imprint also kept an iron in the gospel fire, though as his operation began colonizing the pop charts, the small niche market wouldn't have a place at Hitsville for long. And then there's the handful of strange, old-timey country releases from the Mel-o-dy label. A few of them are actually pretty good, but where they fit in the overall Motown story is anyone's guess. Not that any of these excursions held Gordy back: By the end of the year, he'd purchased several houses in his neighborhood and a downtown ballroom, creating a genuine Hitsville within Detroit. The label arranged international distribution via EMI, and sure enough, the Beatles' early LPs contained Motown covers. Other pieces were moving into place, too. Artist development and quality control were firmly established, the Four Tops had been signed, Holland/Dozier/Holland landed the Supremes in the top 40 with the brilliant ""When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes"", Earl Van Dyke took the helm of the Funk Brothers and made them even tighter, and the Temptations-- still toiling in obscurity-- added David Ruffin, completing what would become their classic line-up. By this point, Gordy had stepped back from the creative process to take a more administrative and directive role, but he returned to songwriting in late November to write ""May What He Lived for Live"", a heartfelt tribute to the fallen president he had so loyally supported. Sung with operatic fervor by Liz Lands, it's a stirring if atypical homage. One gets the sense that the end of 1963 was a somber time for Berry Gordy, but 1964 held unimaginable things in store.","Third volume in Hip-O Select's Motown series features every A- and B-side the legendary Detroit label issued in 1963.

Zoom (It Happens All Over the World) EP / Music From Bubble EP,Robert Pollard,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d25e6ef95969320041/1:1/w_160/4e830392.gif,2005-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11806-zoom-it-happens-all-over-the-world-ep-music-from-bubble-ep/,Recordhead,"With Guided by Voices dissolved and at least two solo records completed, you'd think Robert Pollard might like to take a break for once-- if not for artistic reasons, then to build anticipation for his upcoming double album. Of course, the forces that compel him to pen new material daily haven't abated, and he continues to insist on releasing virtually all of this music in a steady, intractable flow. Since disbanding Guided by Voices almost a year ago, Pollard has already released two EPs under his own name-- and that's disregarding the side projects, compilations, and, oh right, an album composed entirely of stage banter. Of these EPs, one is a slipcase-bound sampling of acoustic rock, while the other is a brief soundtrack for the Steven Soderbergh film Bubble, set in Pollard's native Ohio. (Soderbergh, an apparent fan, also contributed a list of fawning bullet points to Jim Greer's recent Guided by Voices book.) Bubble is, surprisingly, the more fully produced and cohesive piece, a collaboration between Pollard and multi-instrumentalist/recent production foil Todd Tobias. ""All Men Are Freezing"" is a rousing midtempo rocker with romantic lyrics that are surprisingly-- if blandly-- straightforward for Pollard, alternating ""miss you"" and ""kiss you"" in several lines. ""747 Ego"" is a chunk of lumbering, beer-stained bloat-rock that's old hat to Pollard by now, and familiar to anyone who's followed late-era GbV (and lucky us, the final track is a reprise). ""Boring About"" and ""Search-Light Pickups"" are brightly recorded but unmemorable instrumentals given thrust by acoustic guitar. And Pollard absolutely maims the melody of ""I'm No Child""-- unless you find the babyish murmuring at the song's end amusing. Granted, the film may serve as a more ideal setting for these tracks, but as a stand-alone release, Bubble delivers an uninspired sampling a few of Pollard's songwriting modes, and nothing more. When casual fans shout down Pollard's quality control issues, Bubble is the kind of record they're talking about. Zoom exudes more creativity and homespun charm. By all appearances, it epitomizes the cast-off, with simple, traditional compositions, and hiss-drowned taped dialogue filling out the corners. But opener ""Dr. Fuji and Henry Charleston (Zoom Variation)"" is a quaint guitar duet between Pollard and late-era axeman Doug Gillard that's unprecedented in Bob's catalog, and the title track's rosy-cheeked melody and skip-along drum machine rhythm are charming elements of an unusually demure Pollard track. Even the raw ""Catherine from Mid-October"" sparkles, a gorgeous acoustic demo waiting to be fleshed out. Elsewhere, the dialogue snippet segues find Pollard teasing a heavily accented woman attempting to define conceptual art, and talking with another woman whose affirmations sound like a lecture from a life coach. They're brief pieces, but add just enough contrast to the cozy, informal atmosphere of the songs. Ultimately, though, neither of these EPs is near to what one might call ""essential,"" nor do they contain any real gems worth plundering, save the potential of ""Catherine from Mid-October"" being re-recorded by a full band somewhere down the line. Still, the worst I can say of Pollard in his comfort zone is that he's more competent than he's generally given credit for, and if nothing else, you can never be sure exactly what to expect.","Two EPs from the prolific former Guided by Voices leader, one of which was written for a Steven Soderbergh film.

The Rescue (Travels in Constants Vol. 21),Explosions in the Sky,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd8eb335119a49ecd61/1:1/w_160/5972060e.gif,2005-12-07 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2882-the-rescue-travels-in-constants-vol-21/,Temporary Residence,"Thanks to a series of phenomenal albums and a reputation for jaw-dropping live performances, Explosions in the Sky have become one of the strongest voices in post-rock. Even so, it was surprising when the band was commissioned to provide the score for the high school football film Friday Night Lights, a movie whose core audience has likely never heard of them. The soundtrack's subtle, moody compositions were unlike their typically explosive, epic work, and that shift toward a quieter, more delicate sound is found again on volume 21 of Temporary Residence Limited's mail-order-only Travels in Constants series. For The Rescue, Explosions in the Sky recorded eight songs in eight days, creating a slightly disconnected affair, with the band in an atypically casual, carefree mood. Freeing themselves from the constraints of a normal cohesive thematic unit, they branch out, experimenting with new instruments, voices, and moods. Although the songs lack some of the tension-building dynamics of their previous works, they are still compelling, passionate, and full of beautiful elements and energetic performances, and many of the band's more recognizable characteristics-- hollow, bright guitar tones, marching snare rolls, and sorrowful yet ultimately triumphant melodies-- are still here. The tracks are titled ""Day One"" through ""Day Eight"", presumably representing the day each was arranged and recorded. ""Day One"" opens with a quiet feedback and shuffling drumbeat would easily fit in on either of the last two full lengths. On ""Day Two"", new paths unfold. The track's primary instrument is the piano, and a chorus of oohs and aahs swirls throughout. It's the first time vocals have graced an Explosions in the Sky track, but they're used primarily as texture rather than the song's focus. Piano is also prominently featured on many of the tracks here: On ""Day Four"", it tinkles over down-mixed cymbal crashes and delayed guitar strumming. On ""Day Five""-- the most upbeat and cheerful thing the band has recorded-- sharp piano and chiming bells augment echoing guitar melodies. Maintaining the jovial feel, ""Day Seven"" is reminiscent of a forlorn holiday tune, with jingling bells and more ethereal non-verbal vocals. ""Day Six"" stands out as the album's strongest offering. Reversing the crescendo pattern used by so many instrumental bands, the song begins with booming drums and layers of distorted bass, high-end guitars, and uplifting piano. But then, after a minute and a half, it melts away into a familiar feedback drone, and the instruments creep back in a much more subdued manner. Thanks to increasing skill and higher production values, the band has mastered the art of using guitars to mimic other instruments, and throughout the latter portion of the song, they drone in the background, trilling like flutes and gliding like violins. The only real misstep here occurs in ""Day Three"", which could've been a creepy, atmospheric piece built on swirling ambient tones and reversed guitar chords. Any amount of focus that could be placed on those elements, however, is distracted by the inclusion of a conversation about a failed van transmission and the amount of money required to fix it. Even in an album that features more relaxed and light-hearted material, this seems out of place. It's not only a distraction in the song, but it unfortunately breaks up an otherwise captivating, albeit brief, album.","Post-rock band contributes the latest volume in Temporary Residence Limited's mail order-only Travels in Constants series.

If You Were Born Overseas,Norfolk & Western,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9655e6ef95969322958/1:1/w_160/61b8361e.gif,2005-12-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5890-if-you-were-born-overseas/,self-released,"Not sure if Norfolk & Western frontman Adam Selzer's Thomas Hobbes references (""We were both reading Leviathan/ Not necessarily your best seller"") signify any more than some shared cross-café literacy, but it's probable. In its seven-year run, the band appears to have drawn up a commonwealth-through-social-contract type deal: Selzer's the sovereign, and citizens suspend sleepiness in exchange for the loveliest of songs, both gorgeous and soporific. Earlier albums (Dusk in Cold Parlours, in particular) were lulling and understated-- they portended great things, but lacked immediacy: If Selzer would swap reservation for liberties maybe he'd be onto something. N&W; now outdo themselves effortlessly-- maybe inadvertently-- with the tour-only If You Were Born Overseas (originally sold on recent treks with M. Ward, the CD is now available on N&W;'s website). ""The Shortest Stare"" uncannily channels the Decemberists: Selzer croons unlike Dean Wareham, for once, and sounds as nose-jammed as Colin Meloy, as assured as Mark Kozelek. It's not any less authentic than usual, though, and the likeness makes sense: multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Rachel Blumberg is sometimes-drummer for the Decemberists, Selzer plays bass for M. Ward, and though the album's nothing exotic, it's still beautiful in its traditional grounding (itinerancy, rather). Norfolk & Western's tradition is in railroad tracks, Adam Selzer's great-grandpa, Adam Selzer, was the first conductor of coal trains across Virginia. Selzer and Blumberg deny themselves standard vehicular luxuries of modern transport, and insist on touring exclusively by train. Only so much shit can go down on trains, but Norfolk & Western's progressed from busted, kinda-boring boxcar moods to forward locomotion-- pushing their hallmark folksy envelope to span wider, with Overseas waxing and waning but mostly waxing poetical-- sometimes a stalled Polar Express shipping kids to snowier places, and others the jaunty engines to Anywhere, U.S.A.; they could've easily run out of steam, but pick it up instead: Even songs that don't fall far from the tree of previous work still move charmingly. ""She Won't Be Famous"" accrues strings and drums in a simple, perfect crux of resignation; a girl who's ""timid and shy, doesn't try"" only lets a privileged few hear her songs, but when Selzer eavesdrops (""On Sunday morning, I hear through the walls/ the prettiest voice""), it's bliss, more or less. Spotted with songs like these (see also ""Porch Destination""), Overseas moves beautifully-- the voices of Blumberg and Selzer fit as perfect as usual-- but still stalls too often. Cinched tighter, their forthcoming A Gilded Age EP (which will include different versions of Overseas tracks, and others) seems terribly promising.","On this tour-only, self-released album, frontman Adam Selzer comes across like a mix of Colin Meloy and Mark Kozelek.

Kosmischer Pitch,Jan Jelinek,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e8ea9e61561daa70d6/1:1/w_160/fc4067ab.jpg,2005-12-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4237-kosmischer-pitch/,~scape,"Jan Jelinek is fond of conceptual hooks. Going back to his Farben alias, tracks titles like ""Live at the Sahara Tahoe, 1973"" and ""Farben Says: Love to Love You Baby"" reinforced that project's excavation of dance music tropes, where snapshots of soul and disco appeared as sonic negatives. On name alone, Loop-finding-jazz-records hinted at a trip-hop spin through the Blue Note catalog but led instead to something far more abstract, as tiny grains of samples were placed under the sound equivalent of a high-powered microscope and stretched into unrecognizable shapes. La Nouvelle Pauvreté introduced Jelinek's ""backing band"" the Exposures, which turned out to be just another mischievous device for him to explore the signifiers of live performance in a controlled studio setting. This playfully cerebral approach has resulted in one of the more remarkable bodies of work in electronic music. For Kosmischer Pitch, Jelinek draws from the obsessed-over rock produced by his German countrymen in the 1970s. Of Jelinek's experiments with reference and allusion, Kosmischer Pitch may well have the clearest lines between inspirational source and finished track, but the connections are still subtle. Two forces seem to be operating simultaneously and both stem from familiar Jelinek obsessions. First, motivation comes primarily from the minute detail found in the production of the source material, the way the instruments and studio engineering choices of a specific time and place fused to form the regional flavor of psychedelia that came to be called krautrock. A digital approximation of early synths like the gurgling Moog along with fragments of guitar are common to most pieces, which congeal into a thick, wooly texture. The second notable feature is the strong focus on highly repetitious loops as the means of composition. Jelinek curiously avoids the obvious ""motorik"" metaphor and offers instead loose, overlapping phrases that suggest a machine bolted to the floor and gyrating in place. Trance-inducing repetition is constantly modulated by variations that hover on the threshold of audibility. ""Universal Band Silhouette"", for example, spins over and over through a progression that at first seems to be a static meditation on four grimy organ chords but actually grows steadily in intensity with each new cycle. As the music becomes progressively crowded time itself seems to stretch to allow for the inclusion of more sound, a peculiar and disorienting effect that's new to Jelinek's world and forms the basis of several tracks. It never gets old. Again Jelinek has assembled an album designed to work as a whole, with a consistent palette and tracks that bleed one into the next. Not a single track on Kosmischer Pitch would sound correct placed on any another Jelinek album, which, at a time when so many great electronic producers seem to have become prisoners to their own sound, is a surpassing virtue. Down deep Jelinek has base aesthetic principals to guide him, but he's clearly unafraid of change. Let's hope future explorations lead somewhere this engaging. ","On his latest album, the German producer draws from the obsessed-over rock produced by his countrymen in the 1970s.

L.S.T.,Shugo Tokumaru,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8899d034d5c69bf3a84/1:1/w_160/3fe6e721.jpg,2005-12-07 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8271-lst/,Compare Notes,"The original review I wrote for Shugo Tokumaru's 2004 debut, that spritely guitar-pop mini-album called Night Piece, got shot back to me. A Tokyo twentysomething whisking through his own soundscapes, losing himself in the cinema, shooting guns at wild west bad guys, battle rapping-- apparently it wasn't criticism. Fair enough, but as I work through this follow-up jam L.S.T., what jumps out most is how un-evocative it is by comparison. Shugo's really pulled back. In just a half-hour, Night Piece covered impossible ground stylistically, flirted with genre pastiche but still came unassuming. It was clever, making something cohesive of all that j-pop video game and film scoring and straight-up, unequivocal pop stuff-- maybe not as lovable immediately, but certainly more memorable. L.S.T. has one-speed-- Raffi Plays the Shins-- and while Shugo's clearly settling into being ""one of those guys who just writes good songs, man,"" he's also not come up with anything special here, or memorable, or anything more than pleasant. Still, as far as inoffensive acoustic guitar pop goes, this ain't bad. Give Shugo a chance to snap ""Mist"" out its woozy lullablahs; his sudden, close-mic'd guitar strums grit forcefully like the opening moments of Microphones' It Was Hot. The whistling on ""Mushina"" beats Andrew Bird's for most dulcimer, and ""Vista"" has something of a less-collective Broken Social Scene sound to it, with heavy reverb, disembodied vocals, and big dumb horn melodies. The first 100 seconds or so of ""Yukinohaka"" promise to sour L.S.T.'s unfazable grin, something along the lines of Ben Chasny's rolling drone figures, but then Shugo starts singing. And oh that voice-- it's as if nothing could possibly go wrong when that unintelligible full-bodied whisper of his courses these headphones. This time Shugo's pushed it into the instrument mix further, sometimes even pitting it against the intermittent noisemaking that normally stays beneath the guitar lines. But then I hear something like ""Karte"". It's by far the least pleasant song here-- super-cartoonish silent movie chase music, no vocal melody to rally behind, occasionally showy guitar-playing, some weird squeaky wheel sound I can imagine is torture for some. To be honest I hated it at first, because the short, nimble track has more energy than the rest of the album combined, more smarts too-- the only track Shugo didn't dumb himself down for. It doesn't go down easy, and some spots do prick at first, but that's pittance for smart and lovable-- maybe we could stand to meet him halfway.","Second album from this Japanese artist is more song-based and less evocative than his intriguing debut.

Singles,New Order,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e1c0084474cd0c3583/1:1/w_160/469e6cbb.jpg,2005-12-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5770-singles/,London,"There are lots of different ways of thinking about singles, of which let's just mention two. The album-oriented Rock Way is suspicious of singles: It's cool if a band writes something easy-to-like by accident, but to sit down and do it intentionally would be, like, crass and commercial. The Pop Way, on the other hand, is interested in how singles can work in a big social context-- the way you and 80% of everyone in a 10-mile radius can know and share the experience of, say, dancing to ""Dancing Queen"". The fascination here is that there's some conversation going on in Our Common Culture, and that a song can carve out spots in the lives of millions of people, whether or not said people actually buy the thing, or even know who sang it. This mindset holds slightly more sway in the UK, where it's a matter of more or less national trivia who holds the #1 single at Christmas time, or who's been picked to do the next Bond-movie theme. I mention this because the product we're talking about today is a complete collection of the A-sides from New Order's 31 UK singles. That means these discs basically upgrade and/or supersede the Substance compilation, which is already most Americans' primary take-home method of engaging with New Order; this grouping updates stuff to the present, which means a bunch of latter-day singles that fewer people actually care about. For a lot of bands, this kind of thing would be a Greatest Hits proposition-- a run-down of album highlights, plus maybe a remix or soundtrack tune. With New Order, it is, of course, anything but. What you get instead is something like a timeline of this band's peculiar and ever-changing relationship with the single as a format, and all the notions of participation in Our Common Culture that come along with that. And the really weird twist is this: Part of what makes the collection so engaging in the fact that New Order have not always been good at negotiating this stuff. From leftover Joy Division songs to 12-inch dance edits to World Cup anthems, they tend to be sorting it out as they go along, which turns out to be more interesting to follow than if they knew exactly what they were up to. The first four singles here accomplish as much as most bands do in their careers, which is to find their sound and make it work. This is where the energetic hustle and excited riffing of certain Joy Division songs turns over into the ""happier"" major-key gut-stirring stuff that makes New Order anthems so lovable: Vocals have shifted from dour, gruff Ian to starry-eyed Bernard, Gillian has come in on keyboards, and by the time you get to the 7"" version of ""Temptation"" the whole thing has coalesced into the cruising, casual, hook-filled style that would sustain this band's pretty-great rock albums for years to come. (And not just them: the guitar and bass sounds here are the basic DNA at the core of a massive chunk of indie.) The not-very-good single from this period, in fact, is ""Everything's Gone Green"", in which the band discovers a) Computer-based sequencers, and b) Almost the exact vocal line from ""Blue Monday"", and stumble their way through an awkward dry run-- i.e., for a second, they were actually doing better not trying anything new. Then they embrace dance music: the drum machines and sequencers, the extended 12"" mixes, the single as something totally distinct from the album version, the iconic ""Blue Monday"". Given how successful all that stuff turned out-- you probably hear ""Blue Monday"" more than ""Dancing Queen""-- it's tempting to think this is the part where New Order start aiming their singles the Pop Way. The truth, though, is possibly the other way around. Geeking out on computer music, Italian disco, and Kraftwerk, collaborating with NYC dance producers like Arthur Baker: This stuff was New Order abandoning a working formula to follow their own muse, one exploratory enough that it was probably more likely to lead them to the punks-gone-dance obscurity of A Certain Ratio than the dance-pop stardom of Duran Duran. And yet, and yet: ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling British 12"" single. One reason for this is that ""Blue Monday"" is totally fucking sweet. (Even if you think it's ""overplayed,"" which it is, it's still totally fucking sweet.) Another essential thing, though, is that starry-eyed ultra-earnest quality of Bernard's. The English seem to have a soft spot for anyone who can credibly fit the everyday white guy into dance music, which is usually assumed too futuristic or ""soulful"" (read: non-white) to accommodate him-- see also Happy Mondays, Primal Scream, ""Born Slippy"". New Order's best dance music did exactly this: It allowed the group to work, genuinely and enthusiastically, in all sorts of cool new electronic dance tropes while still allowing Bernard and bass-playing Peter to function like everyday white-guy indie lads. (Bernard's chronically clunky lyrics might even have helped: This is a guy who doesn't just rhyme ""June"" with ""spoon,"" but requires seriously dubious associations just to rhyme ""own"" with ""phone."" All while talking about serious stuff.) The combination's not only totally thrilling-- all the perks of dance, pop, and indie in one seamless package-- but accessible to all sorts of people in all sorts of ways. The magic here is that New Order may not have initially courted big popular dance singles; it's possible that they got the popular to come to them. And then look what they could do with it! The middle of this first disc contains all of the moments for which New Order are so well-remembered, even by folks who've never heard any of their albums. ""Blue Monday,"" obviously. Maybe better: ""The Perfect Kiss"", a sunny blend of that early rock cruise with disco claps and soul phrasing. A few singles later, and they've consolidated their dance-edit success with their pop cruise even more deftly-- now they're sitting down and writing smash singles in the Pop Way, new Common-Culture icons like ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""True Faith"". God knows how, but it makes it even better to hear them fail in between peaks like that-- note the 12"" mix of ""Sub Culture"", which turned out iffy enough that regular designer Peter Saville supposedly declined to do a sleeve for it. (One of its problems: Bernard evidently getting self-conscious about the white-guy thing and recruiting Actual Black Women to double his lines, which never works for anyone.) It's good context for those highs, and some of the lesser-known singles are just a testament to the sound: Even when the songwriting's formless and Bernard's using the same chants you heard on the last track, the results are still terrific listening. Just as interesting is the period where New Order are-- on the basis of those smashes-- irrevocably involved in this conversation about Our Common Culture, something that nets any number of curious effects. ""Fine Time"" was the band's response and contribution to the late-80s wave of UK acid house. ""Blue Monday 88"" was a smoothed-out remix by none other than Quincy Jones. ""World in Motion"" was the official theme song for England's 1990 World Cup squad, and was totally freighted by all sorts of terrific Common-Culture concerns, from hooliganism fears to the incipient rise of rave culture; this is the kind of ""talking to the kids"" Art Brut dream of. The peak of it all is 1993's ""Regret"", which is sort of the ultimate New Order song-- a fine-tuned pop single in that same old early-cruising mode, most everything you could love about them crammed into one joyous smash-hit victory lap. I doubt you'll be surprised to hear that the excitement ends there, though the good songs don't. Some singles sound a bit limp, or dire, or offputtingly elder-statesmanly, but there's nothing wrong with or unlovable about, say, ""Crystal"" or ""Here to Stay"" or ""Waiting for the Siren's Call""; there's something just plain basic and familiar and comforting about this band's signature casual pulse, and it's almost reassuringly beautiful to hear them settle ever more comfortably into its formulas. Given the intro to this whole overlong deal, you might assume that I'm in favor of that Pop Way of thinking about singles. And yes, if you put that rhetorical gun to my head and asked me to be a partisan, I probably would be. But the point here is maybe something else-- that all those multiple multiform ways of thinking about how a format like the single can work (Pop Way, Rock Way, Dance Way, Mixtape Way, whatever) create a whole astounding system in and of themselves. And when it comes to the various stories of bands negotiating that system, I can't think of too many that are as fascinating as New Order's-- a story that's pretty much audible on these two discs.","Double disc collects every UK A-side from the dance/indie/pop band's legendary career.

XIAO / Buck Dharma / The Flood,Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab213d1975652139aad/1:1/w_160/0d0faa52.jpg,2005-12-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11867-xiao-buck-dharma-the-flood/,De Stijl,"Like those kindred meta-associatives in Sunburned Hand of the Man or the silvan folksters of the Jewelled Antler Collective, Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice are an epically productive bunch. As a result, each new album in their seemingly constant parade of fried psych/folk/jazz possesses a relaxed air. That unhurried vibe is one of the NYC/Tennessee troupe's strong points; though, on the downside, keeping up with their numerous records can be a son of a bitch. Outside of James Toth's excellent Wooden Wand solo album, Harem of the Sundrum & the Witness Figg, the most recent suite includes Buck Dharma, released as a limited-edition double LP on Time Lag and CD on 5RC; XIAO, a sold-out double De Stijl LP reissued by Troubleman Unlimited; and The Flood, which arrived up in your local record store last month. Corralling these three releases is hardly definitive-- readers should keep ears to the ground a little longer for the jazzed Gipsy Freedom, due on 5RC early next year, and a planned double CD-- one instrumental/one vocal, to be played together as stereo overlap. All said, seems they have Sebadoh-itus. In general, the band tends to do a few different song formations: longish group sing-alongs/chant-alongs with apocalyptic themes and performed with noise squiggles going on behind 'em; burnt folk darkness via Wooden Wand, who sings like Roky Erickson; airy excursions fronted by Satyn Sai, who sings like a 1960s chanteuse; and noisier rambles. WWVV never lock into as aggro rides as No-Neck or Sunburned-- there's something spacier and more fragile going in their ruckus. Each album has its strengths, but Buck Dharma's the better of the older collections. For the opener, the guitar and noise hum of ""Hideous Whisker & His Woman"" feels like a dragonfly darning guitar licks in a Motel 6. Toth baptizes himself with a vat of echo punch for ""Rot On"", laying down Loren Connors flamenco dub. It's always the band's strongest angle when he channels an echoplex preacher. Satya Sai takes the vocal lead on ""Risen From the Ashes""-- guitars pitch ragged Wayne Rogers-like psych blood at her airy delivery. ""Satya Sai Scupetty Plays 'Reverse Jam Band'"" is, more or less, as the title says, with Sai jamming for over 10 minutes to ambling, rusted root backwardness. The guitarist's start turn is ""Steven the Harvester Presides O'er the Din of the Cups"", a mess of flickered drone dream over drum soloing. There's plenty of good stuff across the nine tracks, but the best is the finale, ""Wicked World""-- think of an 11-minute Woven Hand damnation call around a U.S. Saucer campfire. The liner notes (as incantation) come courtesy of Byron Coley. Pete Nolan of Magik Markers guests. Accompanied by extensive Thurston Moore-penned road-trippin' liner notes and more peyote than the acid-hinged Buck Dharma, XIAO crunks like Castanets on no-doze. The songwriting and/or improvising seems more tentative or redundant, as if the posse's not quite sure where they're going. Still, the crew does eventually make it to the silty baptismal font of the Mississippi. Oddly, you can occasionally pick bits of Smog from the pacing of ""Paper Trail Blues""'s junk-n-bowed percussion and camel-through-a-pinhole Bible story. Satya Sai is a female John the Baptist or some other desert rattlesnake charmer on ""Caribou Christ in the Great Void"". The centerpiece is the Native American ""Weird Wisteria Tangles Carrion Christ But Intends No Harm"" has me thinking of Angus MacLise jangling into an outdoor love song. There's a scrappy belly-of-the-whale feel to the Jonah-seafaring-jam ""Lions In Love""-- not too many joyful sounds on this one, though it does get a bit rockin' at the end. ""Return of the Nose"" has Toth's voice upfront, backed by a lovely ""all roads lead to him"" church choir. I've had Buck Dharma and XIAO for ages and both took a little time to really sink in, but The Flood's apocalyptic drone hit me from the first listen. It's a fresh set of detuned atmospheric blues dedicated to sax player Charles Gayle and Death Vessel. From the opening strums of ""Snake Earl"", The Flood feels more assured. Of the six songs, three are more than 10 minutes long, and all are well done. The hypnotic 14-minute title track is a Noah-focused group chant-- the noise waves increase as the song gurgles onward. The guitar piece, ""(I Wanna Live In) Sunbeam Creek"", is perhaps the most unadorned and sprightly beautiful WWVV track so far. I could imagine Cardinal using it as a bridge between two hooks. Dropping ""American Pie""'s Chevy and levee, the reverbed, howling strummer, ""Dogpaddlin' Home to Live With My Lord"" is as good and lovey-dove countrified as anything from Harem of the Sundrum. Turning the Zombies into an autobiographical sketch, ""Imeltime of the Season (Interlude)"" is a spiraled guitar and woodblock backed by Toth waving goodbye. The finale is close to 15 minutes of the standard Satya Sai piece, this one called ""Satya Sai Sweetback Plays Oxblood Boots"": more blocky percussion (this time in more of a loping loop), laser gun, echoing vocals chopped between speakers, guitar hum, some of that Gayle stuff, flood themes, etc. On Halloween, two weeks before I'd heard The Flood, I ran into Vanishing Voice members Glucas Crane and Steven the Harvester sitting on a bench between some of the only pine trees on Bedford Avenue. It made sense to see that they'd cozied themselves within a personal urban pine forest to watch paired kids parade past in colorful and spooky garb. Now, post-flood, it gives chills-- like it was some kind of Noah's Ark trial run.","Trio of recent releases from the unhurried NYC/Tennesse troupe.

February,Jonathan Kane,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4eea9e61561daa744c/1:1/w_160/b6835dcb.jpg,2005-12-06 06:01:40,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4603-february/,Table of the Elements,"As co-founder of Swans and a volcanic drummer behind such notables as Rhys Chatham and La Monte Young, Jonathan Kane has provided the rhythmic foundation for several classic Downtown NYC landmarks. Perhaps it's this pedigree that allows Kane to deliver his solo debut February with such high decibel self-assurance. His music's intrinsic swagger is crucial to the album's success, for here Kane has chosen to work almost exclusively within the outwardly stagnant vocabulary of the blues. Though he utilizes some of the most familiar and overworked progressions of the past several decades, on these five pieces he side-steps cliché by marshaling his minimalist riffs to their trance-inducing limits, and deftly sparks a synaptic link between Neu!-style repetition and the hypnotic electric blues of Junior Kimbrough. With the exception of some guitar contributions from Igor Cubrilovic, February is a true solo work, as Kane handles the rest of the guitar, bass, and drum duties himself. On these five instrumental pieces he's stripped away all of his music's inessentials, excising overwrought vocals or flashy solos to instead pare these blues-based excursions down to a streamlined, locomotive core. Kicking immediately into an unapologetic foursquare blues riff, the 12-minute opener ""Curl"" initially does little to impress, Kane biding his time as he patiently sweeps again and again through each dusty corner. As the track progresses, however, the riff begins to build a tenacious momentum through a series of almost imperceptable directional shifts, and soon the massed overtones of the guitars course against Kane's powerhouse drumming to assemble into a singularly captivating propulsive drone. Likewise, the set's version of the traditional ""Motherless Child"" elongates the old spiritual's structure nearly beyond the point of recognition, with each melodic detail considered in isolation beneath distant ascending distortion and the rolling boulders of Kane's unyielding rhythms. Spacious tracks like ""Pops"" and ""Sis"" incorporate subtle traces of parched earth Americana to somewhat less invigorating effect, although Kane supplies each with a certain sawtooth grit and a cold-blooded rattlesnake resolve. But he saves his most effective transmutation for last with his mammoth set-closing take on Rhys Chatham's epic ""Guitar Trio"". Whereas the original was a cascading, open-tuned electrical current, Kane's blues-refracted interpretation concentrates its substantial energies onto the piece's imposing rhythmic lumber. Over the course of the track's 12-minute length, Kane adds and removes sonic elements with the single-minded endurance of wide, muddy river carving itself a canyon, and with the unwavering confidence of an already-veteran solo performer secure in his vision.","As co-founder of Swans and a volcanic drummer behind such notables as Rhys Chatham and La Monte Young, Jonathan Kane ...

Fragments,Capillary Action,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74b5e6ef95969320f3d/1:1/w_160/ee3d4e2c.gif,2005-12-06 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1824-fragments/,Pangaea,"I think at this point we've established that reasonable guitar solos are okay again, and that all of punk's moping about displays of virtuosity was just depriving us of one of the best parts of the song. After all, the fear of rocking out is a pretty silly phobia. It would be an exaggeration to say that Capillary Action's debut Fragments is all about guitar solos (there are piano and keyboard solos, too), but virtuosity and rocking out are both very much in the cards. Before discussing any of that, though, I'd like to address the drunken samba ""A Hundred Pages of Cannot Be Named"" that sits in the middle of the album, next to a jazz piano thing called ""Scattered Remnants"". These two tracks form the quiet but still jittery core of a record that generally feeds on adrenaline, and they're a necessary respite amidst tracks like the spasmodic and pretty aptly titled ""Mid-Coital Seizure"", which sounds a little like three Need New Body songs fighting. Instrumental rock can be a dead zone or a playground, and guitarist/core member Jonathan Pfeffer is determined to make Fragments the latter, dragging noise from his Fender one minute and layering intricate little thickets of arpeggiated rhythm the next. The second and penultimate tracks on the album, ""Ticking Ghosts, pt. 2"" and ""Architecture Would Fail"", flirt with that dirty hyphenate prog-metal; the first taking it straight on with pummeling guitar/drum stutters and harmonized leads, while ""Architecture"" cuts passages of fretboard fireworks with jarring interjections of brutal noise-rock and forehead-crushing kickdrum. The best track is opener ""Ticking Ghosts, pt. 1"", which splits the difference between Pfeffer's spacier and harder-rocking tendencies, riding a swaying 6/8 groove through passages that alternately chime and squall. Fragments is a nifty guitar record that plays well with different moods and feels, making for a cohesive whole that flows from track to track in an almost suite-like fashion. It's an assured debut, and Pfeffer is a clearly talented musician who bears watching to see where he'll take his craft.","Virtuosity, power, and guitar solos are on display on this Pangaea release.

Crime & Dissonance,Ennio Morricone,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44e69fc7814a47cd85b/1:1/w_160/8797a2d6.jpg,2005-12-06 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5570-crime-dissonance/,Ipecac,"When most rock critics compare music to Ennio Morricone's scores-- and they compare things to him a lot-- they're speaking of one very specific corner of his long career as a film composer. It's the big, echo-ing spaghetti Western sound he popularized in his work with director (and fellow Italian) Sergio Leone, full of twanging guitar and high lonesome ambiance. The comparison is often apt, but it only captures a sliver of what the man did for film music, the part most of us know and love. Crime & Dissonance, a new double-disc compilation from Mike Patton's Ipecac label digs beyond his Western work and his 1980s experiments with early digital synthesizers for films like the Untouchables (a score I actually think is awful, at least in terms of how it matches with the film) to his music for 1960s and 70s Italian crime and exploitation movies. The music unearthed here is a minor revelation, among the oddest produced by a true auteur and frequently quite innovative for its era. Alan Bishop curates the tracklist (no less an avant garde legend than John Zorn provides limited liner notes), and he's chosen some wonderfully dark and bizarre stuff that careens from musique concrete, melodramatic church organ pieces and free jazz to wah-drenched psychedelia, stiff funk, and abstract avant-gardism. The two discs are sequenced more for flow than anything else, jumping back and forth over a range of films completed between 1968 and 1981. This makes for a great listen, eschewing historical baggage that only a few people are likely to care much about anyway. The spry title theme to Gli Intoccabili segues remarkably well into ""Fondate Paure"", a slow, menacing piece from a film recorded three years later, as both make excellent use of oddly arranged strings. ""Gli Intoccabili"" is founded on a manic jazz/funk vamp, which thrusts along under strings scored with no vibrato, giving them a dead, discordant tone-- the tension between rhythmic movement and melodic iciness is enough to prick your hair up. Morricone was obviously heavily effected by the psychedelic movement of the late 60s, and guitar feedback, oscillations, Eastern scales and heavy wah guitar are frequent sonic signifiers. The lone post-1980 track, ""Fumeria D'Oppio"", is a haunting bit of largely unaccompanied gypsy violin that's eventually joined by guitar so subtle that it's only noticeable peripherally-- you barely hear it when you listen for it. It's the kind of detail that abounds here, and each composition is far more loaded with fine points than it first appears to be. Take ""Memento"", from the 1971 film ""L'Istruttoria E' Chiusa: Dimentchi"", which electronically subverts a choir to sparse free improvisation. The following track is a collage, fading harmonized female voices in and out with a weird psych instrumental, a string processional and marching soldiers. More than setting the tone for Western scores for a generation, Morricone's greatest legacy is perhaps the way he used sound elementally, largely disregarding the expectations his captive listeners had of guitars, orchestras and percussion in favor of combinations that captured very specific moods in a way most traditional soundtracking methods simply couldn't. His music is often hard to pin emotionally for the same reasons-- the emotion we so frequently draw from music is largely a result of the harmonic clichés we learn to associate with certain feelings, and he doesn't use any of those clichés in these pieces. Crime & Dissonance is perhaps the most essential Morricone compilation out there in that, in skipping hits like the theme from ""the Good, the Bad & the Ugly"", it captures his darkest, most adventurous material, shedding light on a part of his career that hasn't been explored deeply enough.","Ipecac's 2xCD compilation digs beyond western scores and 1980s digital experiments to his music for 1960s and 70s Italian crime and exploitation movies.

Wait Long By the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By,The Drones,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc55e6ef95969322cb9/1:1/w_160/f450d7c9.jpg,2005-12-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2627-wait-long-by-the-river-and-the-bodies-of-your-enemies-will-float-by/,ATP,"Pay no mind to the misleading name: The Drones are in no way a noise band, Tony Conrad-derived, or psychedelic. Actually, on first listen the Australian quartet may seem like little more than an unhinged bluesy garage outfit-- but that's because career music fans are too often trained to shun things that work within genre definitions. Serious, give these fuckers time and they'll rip out your eardrums, perhaps even your heart. Vocalist/guitarist Gareth Liddiard and guitarist Rui Pereira found a drummer and bassist and formed the group in Melbourne in early 2000. They put out an eponymous EP in 2001 and a year later released the full-length debut, Here Come the Lies (which tellingly included a cover of the Cramps' ""New Kind of Kick""). Over the next three years they only put out two 7"" singles. Now, kinda out of nowhere, comes their amped sophomore dispatch, Wait Long By the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By. Playing together for a half-decade has resulted in shivery tightness: Notes bend and expand just as a snare wakes up; the bass adds an exclamation to a vocal line. They have the boundless cohesion and energy of X or the Gun Club. Judging them against other Australian acts, you'll find more than a bit of Kim Salmon's Scientists (see, for instance, their 1983 single ""We Had Love"") and, of course, the Birthday Party (albeit with less all-over-the-place percussion, horns, and avant tendencies). Despite the band's meshing, the focus rests squarely on vocalist/guitarist Gareth Liddiard. A tall, lean rocker who flails on floors and swings his guitar over his head, Liddiard's reminiscent of the Laughing Hyenas' John Brannon in his willingness to shred his vocal chords. Fast forward to his bloody howl on the poppy, Ponys-like ""Baby"" to get an idea of the scratchy decibels. Lyrically, the Drones' world's crammed with drunkenness, night sweats, and suicide notes. The album opens with ""Shark Fin Blues"", one of the best rockers of the year, a seemingly endless path of riffs and dynamics and a good introduction to Liddiard's nihilistic subject matter. The song's protagonist is stuck on a sinking ship, watching sharks ""coming fin by fin"" toward the wreckage ""like slicks of ink."" He thinks he sees Jonah, there's an albatross á la Samuel Taylor Colerdige's ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"", and the captain's ""laid up in the galley like a dried out mink...dying of thirst."" He admits he's going to be alone, asking ""Why don't you get down in the sea/ Turn the water red like you want to be?"" And there you are, losing oxygen sans friends, all by your lonesome. The other thing the band does is slow. things. down. They take their time with pieces like ""Sitting on the Edge if the Cryin'"" and ""The Best You Can Believe In"", which closes with smears of vibrato distortion and posits that there isn't much in which you can have faith. Variations on this crisis are echoed throughout: For instance, in the aforementioned ""Baby,"" Liddiard admits, ""Man, I won't ever be free/ Though alone drunk on a beach/ Ain't such a bad way to be."" The aptly titled ""Another Rousing Chorus You Idiots!!!"" Perhaps the track most structurally redolent of Laughing Hyenas' slow-burn blues lets it be known that ""We were shat from wormholes...there's no use for order."" It's also a solidly working-class record, discussing the walk home from the factory or, as in ""Locust"", sketching a depressing port town. In what amounts to the town's love story, the protagonist's first girl, daughter of drunken war veteran, leaves a suicide note. One of the more atmospheric tracks, it opens with moments of feedback and single piano notes while Liddiard pensively intones, ""Georgie, I can't stop drinking/ Seems like every time I can't stop thinking."" The tracks ends under a distorted gale of malleted piano strings, frenzied bows, and a tidal whirlpool of guitar noise. Albums that stick come in various shades: Something surprisingly ambitious like Sufjan Steven's Illinois, meta-smart like Art Brut's debut, as beautifully honed as Othrelm's OV, or as magnificently unrelenting as Sunn 0)))'s Black One. Wait Long By the River sounds nothing like any of these, and won't win awards for originality. But it could garner some props for brilliance. There's nothing wrong with being a solid whiskey-drunk rock band. But really, the greatest thing about such a pessimistic bunch of sots (with a truly ecstatic spitter) is the realization that they're too smart to relegate drowning to one's enemies. Hey, if you hang out by the river long enough, you'll most likely spot a couple of friends, too.","Australian quartet plays tight, working-class rock, creating vocal-shredding songs crammed with crammed with drunkenness, night sweats, and suicide notes.

Brocade,Landing,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc99ea9e61561daa74ee/1:1/w_160/3ebbe6ce.jpg,2005-12-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4674-brocade/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"After six albums of sedate post-shoegaze pop, Connecticut-based quartet Landing have gradually seen their work overtaken by the dread shadow of familiarity. So on Brocade-- their return to Strange Attractors after albums on Ba Da Bing! and K-- the group has sensibly taken a hard step away from dreamcore to a slight return to the gauzy space-rock of earlier records like 2002's Fade In/Fade Out, an exchange that includes its own distinct set of pitfalls. On Brocade, however, Landing makes enough strategic use of Kraut-inspired rhythms and shimmering, repetitive minimalism to help sidestep the New Age perils of their ambient celestial navigations. The quartet is still based around the husband-and-wife duo Aaron and Adrienne Snow, but since the release of their 2004 album Sphere founding member Dick Baldwin has moved on, and was replaced by keyboardist Peter Baumann. Seizing upon this subtle change in dynamic, Landing essentially recorded Brocade live in the studio, allowing the album's five tracks to naturally expand and contract with a graceful, unforced dexterity. And unlike much of their recent material, the group spares little attention to either pop songcraft or discernable lyrics, as vocals are kept offstage for nearly the entire length of the album. Bursting forth with an uncharacteristically dissonant thrum of feedback, the opening ""Loft"" soon settles into an agile, motorik lumber, working some of the same rich, patterned fields as Caribou's The Milk of Human Kindness. Throughout the track, competing swells of keyboard lap softly at the rhythm's sturdy shoreline, but this seawall soon crumbles on the percussion-less likes of ""Yon"" or ""Spiral Arms"". On these lengthy pieces, Landing's combinations of tranquil strings and synth drones can at times achieve the spirited delicacy of Brian Eno's collaborations with Cluster. That said, it's often only the group's melodic economy and the occasional loosened analog buzz that distinguishes these tracks from the tepid watercolors that typically soundtrack the Dead Man's Pose at yoga class. It comes as a pleasant shock, then, to have your slumber disrupted by the hard-driving ""How to Be Clear"", Landing's grungiest track to date. The song also features the album's lone vocal, albeit one buried beneath distortion. The track's invigorating effect is magnified when contrasted with the mesmerizing set closer, ""Music For Three Synthesizers"", a hazily-unfolding epic that takes a sheet or two from Keith Fullerton Whitman's music stand. True to its title, this piece features three unaccompanied synths captured in effortlessly transfixing dialogue, as Landing sagely permit themselves to be lifted off course, carried skyward by their music's patient, weightless ascension.","Connecticut-based quartet moves away from dreamcore on this slight return to the gauzy space-rock of their earlier work.

Escape From Dragon House,Dengue Fever,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb40ea9e61561daa71c9/1:1/w_160/1f47df7e.jpg,2005-12-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2506-escape-from-dragon-house/,M80 Music,"World music-- music that expresses the indigenous folk traditions of a specific culture-- has always been closely bound with notions of authenticity, since it develops outside of capitalism's imperatives, solely as a conduit for a culture's heritage. Listening to Dengue Fever's second album, Escape from Dragon House, without any sort of background information or context, it's easy to assume that it's an authentic example of modern Cambodian pop music that has reached American shores, undiluted. In fact, Dengue Fever's story is much more complicated and-- depending on your perspective-- either inauthentic or thrillingly mutli-culti. For my part, I don't believe the dilution of world music is anything to get upset about-- it provides exciting new opportunities for musical expansion and cultural exchange. We tend to think of traditional music as something static, when in fact, traditions evolve over time, picking up new influences according to the maneuvers of history. Now that telecommunications technology grids most of the world, the rate of evolution seems to be speeding up, and the old styles we think of as so permanent either persist outside of the new music, or they become a part of it. So it goes. American rock and soul music and its instrumentation and stylistic tenets found purchase in trad Cambodian music in the wake of the Vietnam War. So Dengue Fever are revising an ""authentic"" style that was actually bastardized from the moment of its inception, folding modern American pop idioms into a Cambodian style that was heavily influenced by classic American surf rock and Nuggets-era garage-psych. Dengue Fever also blend the long rhythmic lines of Ethiopian pop and jazz into the melting pot (for more on Ethiopian music, check out the Ethiopique series, or just ask Joe Tangari). But here's the real kicker: Except for the singer, the entire band is American. Based in Los Angeles, Dengue Feature includes Ethan Holtzman on Farfisa (his phrasing is reminiscent of Ray Manzarek's), guitarist Zac Holtzman, saxophonist David Ralicke (who's played with Beck and Brazzaville), bassist Senon Williams of the Radar Brothers, and drummer Paul Smith. The group assembled around their love of Cambodian music; only then did they find singer Ch'hom Nimol in Long Beach. Nimol sings in her native Khmer, and while she was making her Stateside living singing at Cambodian weddings, she was a star in her native country, often performing before the King and Queen. Dengue Fever's debut album was all covers of the cute, romantic Cambodian pop of the 1960s. Having gotten that out of their systems, they've followed it with an album of original material that shatters the language barrier with mildly psychedelic, blissed out pop. On ""Tip My Canoe"", Zac Holtzman takes a stab at singing in Khmer, laying those long, mellifluous syllables over a tweaky vamp, as Nimol uses her imposing pipes to trace accents so dynamic that they sound almost vocodered as she leaps around her impressive range. ""Sui Bong"" channels Dick Dale through its verses and explodes into crunchy garage rock choruses, with a-- wait for it-- Cambodian rap bridge. ""One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula"" pairs sun-baked spaghetti western guitars with Nimol's clipped, forceful singing, and acoustic ballad ""Hummingbird"" closes the album on a quiet note, with Nimol sliding between English and Khmer. If that fact that Dengue Fever's music has been used in films as diverse as Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers and the John Cusack vehicle Must Love Dogs isn't proof enough of its potent versatility, then the ease and unity with which the band conflates idioms should be.","L.A.-based band fold Ethiopian touches into a Cambodian style of pop heavily influenced by classic American surf rock and Nuggets-era garage-psych.

Angherr Shisspa,Koenji-Hyakkei,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe6ea9e61561daa7349/1:1/w_160/298bca5f.jpg,2005-12-05 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4505-angherr-shisspa/,Skin Graft,"Picture this: a very strange time for the country; dissatisfaction at all points, assisted by a long-standing economic downturn and a distant war that infuriates half the population and seems irrelevant to the other half-- except of course when they have to buy gas, or catch TV news. The American president is polarizing, and if you believe the news media (which, by the way, half the country doesn't-- or will only hear from sympathetic sources), seems as secretive and sinister as the people he was supposed to have fought on the other side of the globe. At the same time, there are constant reminders of progressive thought: unprecedented technological advances, both globally and in outer space; an almost surreal feeling of community and discovery via networks never before imagined. Sure, it's a scary place sometimes, but peering through the colorful distractions, money (or lack thereof), politics, and social strife, somehow this place manages not to explode. Is it a desire for unity? Love or justice? It's hard to pinpoint, but it's enough to stave off civil war for the time being. But this isn't 2005, it's 1968. Just as now, kids then stepped into the middle of the circus any number of ways, from political involvement, to the workforce, to the arts. In music, the tense, multi-directional pull of urban life was felt in radical methods of expression: psychedelia, proto-punk, exaggerated white blues and the actual embrace of forms of music previously out of range (world music, country, and of course soul and funk). Scenes merged and splintered and got mixed up again, creating altogether new ones-- or conversely, the late 60s eliminated the idea of permanent scenes at all, in favor of ever mutating movements of sound. Progressive rock happened this way, and as then, now seems to lurk just around the corner. In 2005, rock-based progressive music is bubbling below the surface with almost as much vigor as it did in the late 60s, just before it hit the pop charts in the early 70s during the heyday of Yes and ELP. We've got Animal Collective, Lightning Bolt, Black Dice, Mars Volta, Vooredoms, Fantomas, Orthrelm, Ruins, Liars, Excepter, Dillinger Escape Plan, Sunn 0))), the Psychic Paramount, seemingly all of Finland...Somehow over the past decade, an onus of experimentation has shifted from the academics and electronic musicians to the rock bands-- just like it did in the almost 40 years ago. Japan's Tatsuya Yoshida has seen it all. As half of the kinetic duo Ruins (and countless other projects), he's helped usher in the idea that rock bands can both ""rock"" and do ""crazy shit,"" usually at the same time. He had precedents (see prog's extended canon), but is easily seen as a godfather of today's blossoming art-rock-noise-pop scene. Koenjihyakkei (or ""hundred sights of Koenji"", referring the area of Tokyo where Yoshida lives) is my favorite of all his bands: imagine Ruins + three or four more people doing interplanetary opera, and you're getting there. The most obvious reference is to French avant-proggers Magma, but on Angherr Shisspa, the band's fourth album, there are also ties to Canterbury prog (Hatfield and the North, National Health) and RIO (Henry Cow, Art Bears). Koenjihyakkei's sound is a compact mix of operatic vocals, repetitive unison riffs, lots of drums and piano, and, with the recent addition of reedist Komori Keiko, the occasional sax solo. In ""Rattims Friezz"" (don't try translating-- Yoshida's words are in a language of his own invention), droney instrumental vamps (dig the opening synth silo), high-speed choral vocals and a surprisingly mellow breakdown near the end where Keiko takes over with his soprano sax-- just before the vocals come in again, and the band pounces on the main riff like a chamber classical group suffering from ADHD. Likewise, the title track alternates almost inhumanly angular melody lines with calmer sections featuring soft vocals and saxophone. For fans of Koenjihyakkei's records, this stuff will seem might different. Gone are the metal guitar overloads, but have no fear, it's not that these guys have gone soft, rather Soft Machine. Bassist Kengo Sakamoto's ""Mibingvahre"" begins as an island chant with hand percussion before exploding into relative chaos via group improv and Yoshida's typically unhinged drumming. There is an emphasis on keyboards throughout (similar to the band's previous album NIVRAYM, though Angherr Shisspa sounds much better recorded), though generally not playing flashy solos. Piano and synthesizer plays the role of guitar, fleshing out the riffs and vamps on ""Grahbem Jorgazz"" and the epic closing piece ""Wammilica Iffirom"". The overall sound is aggressive and quick, though perhaps not as violent as many of Yoshida's other projects can be. Still, his stuff towers over most modern progressive rock because of an attention to detail and almost overwhelming force of conviction. No irony here: this rocks with the teeth and heart to cut through scenes and the ""overground"" like a knife.","Fourth album from this Japanese band featuring Ruins' Tatsuya Yoshida, godfather of today's blossoming art-rock-noise-pop scene.

Expedition to the Hairier Peaks,Mindflayer,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43669fc7814a47cd818/1:1/w_160/aca8f990.gif,2005-12-05 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5545-expedition-to-the-hairier-peaks/,Corleone,"Since 1996, Mindflayer's Matt Brinkman and Brian Chippendale have placed skronk beneath splashes of electronic Day-Glo feedback, with individual pieces reeling like the decapitated segments of basement jams. There's been variation in the overall approach-- last year's Die & Mold 12"" stretched tracks to longer durations; It's Always 1999 basted punchy rocket-fire soundtracking-- but overall the vision's remained more or less the same. Expedition to the Hairier Peaks, the band's fourth album, is rawer, cavernously big-bottomed, and less sequenced than its predecessors. That, and, well, really long. Its trio of 10-plus-minute pieces work (and work well), but because these freeform monsters are followed by a seemingly interminable succession less successful five- to eight-minute rockers, the whoop-ass grows anemic. As so many bands have yet to realize (or realized but decided to ignore?), albums and live shows could be so much more enjoyable if the players simply wacked weeds. It's unclear why Mindflayer overstuffs. As a bit of background: Brinkman pilots Forcefield and Chippendale pounds skins and screams in Lightning Bolt. There's been a considerable time lag when it comes to Mindflayer releases. For example, Hairier Peaks was recorded in October 2002 and released three years later. Likewise, 2004's It's Always 1999 was released five years after it was put to tape, as its title suggests, in 1999. It's hard to call Mindflayer a side project, especially considering Brinkman and Chippendale have been pairing up like this since the mid-90s. But since Forcefield became art-world darlings, partaking in the 2002 Whitney Biennial, and Lightning Bolt emerged as noise-rock poster boys, Mindflayer's stuck playing second fiddle (or distortion pedal, if you will). Still, all's not a wash. The boomy 11-minute opener, ""Rally For A Wind War-- Part 1: Whirlwind Dervish, Part 2: Cracking The Barrier Riffs"" is a tad like Silver Apples eking ""Oscillations"" from within a static maelstrom. It's followed by the serviceable shorty ""Getting Our Hair Done"", a drum solo (with slight bass hum in the distance) that evokes boxers feeling each other out before engaging in the first punch. Like the opener, it just stops-- no attempt to smooth it into the following piece-- and this ragged, free-and-easy approach is a plus. Of all the long balls, the best is ""Each To Their Own Dark Path"", which squeezes two distinct movements into 12 minutes-- the first's an unrelenting This Heat! rave-up; the second has Chippendale gagging on faint Chromatics vocals behind a slightly less rousing monster smash. Despite some beauts, the cataloguing eventually gets tired and even the most patient listener may resort to picking out songs with funny titles: ""Let's Play Holy War Fuckers"", ""Gore Gone Wild"" etc. Entropic noise (or metal-noise or minimalism or whatever) released in the wake of Orthrelm's magnifico OV needs to step it up, which can mean downsizing or interjecting precision or even some sort of theoretical raison de etre. A few weeks back, a friend and I were talking about how it's cool Thurston Moore collaborates on noise stuff and promotes younger artists, but it's disappointing that his experimental side hasn't developed-- i.e. he still basically stands in front of an amp, bends the guitar neck, and baptizes us with his fretwork. I get that same feeling with Mindflayer: Chunks of this racket provide enjoyable sugar lumps, but put them all together on an album, then line said album up with the entire oeuvre, and the flat-line non-arc gives me brain freeze.","Latest from Lightning Bolt's Brian Chippendale and Forcefield's Matt Brinkman is rawer and more cavernous than its predecessors.

Nine Times That Same Song,Love Is All,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab5e5e6ef95969321738/1:1/w_160/9c61ff46.jpg,2005-12-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8971-nine-times-that-same-song/,What's Your Rupture?,"What's the stat, 99% of all songs are love songs? And what's the other, 99% of all love songs make me want to slit my face? Swedish indie pop group Love Is All admit as much in their bandname and album title. It's not necessarily a joke, but they're in on it: All people-- not just songwriters, Hallmark cards, and bridge-and-tunnel dudes in party shirts and going-out jeans-- struggle talking love. Most hack it up; others come too wry on the game, too whiny, or their cleverness can be disgusting. Love Is All make it work cos they know their snags-- shitty equipment, love-lyrical cliché, inevitable Life Without Buildings and Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparisons-- and speed headlong into them regardless. There's a dire necessity to Nine Times That Same Song, and ultimately that's its charm. Like the other recordings on the New York-based What's Your Rupture? label, the playing happens beneath a prophylactic lo-fi glaze. All sounds seem to hit the mic at once, and our ears forgive the occasional imprecisions for the overall fit. So that's the musical counterpart to the lyrical problem-- turning lo-fi from a ho-hum excuse to a gritty asset. But we respond to passion, not perfection, and like your ESGs and Delta 5s, this band makes do like a motherfucker. ""Things, they aren't going that well,"" confesses singer Josephine Olausson on ""Used Goods"", which comes early in Nine Times's faint love-cycle sequencing: fall out, get over, fall in again. The song has sympathy for the stalker, who follows around town the one about to break her heart, noting those worthless similarities we all think actually mean something (""we like the same kind of cheese""). The guitar melody hams, and the rhythm section's on some Looney Tunes-meets-Orange Juice disco chase-scene bit, and funny synths poke out towards the end-- somehow the song communicates the complex of madness, embarrassment, and ""everybody does it, right?""-ness of watching someone pull away. ""I don't mind used goods,"" she admits ashamedly. Most times, though, the lyrics hide deep in reverb; LIA's most affecting turns are musical, and often extremely minimal. ""Talk Talk Talk Talk"" combines Daft Punk's ""one more time!"" chorus mourning in monotone, Karen O's ""rich rich rich"" snarl, James Chance sax skronk, and vicious call-and-response figures in support of the song's only intelligible line: ""Please just leave me alone."" But all that's just a set-up for the band's pregnant mid-song pause-- they come back in a beat earlier than we expect-- and the song's tense last note, one half-step away from resolving. ""Ageing Has Never Been His Friend"" tones down the desperation and ups the dance with a bigger beat, bass octaves, and a happy-go-lucky sax line to underscore the song's misplaced hopes that all things love will stay ""fresh and young"": ""I keep the one I love/ In the freezer."" By ""Turn the Radio Off"", no more bang: The sax plays out of tune, guitarists pluck out the chords as if they've lost all patience, and Olausson delivers the frustrated refrain, ""Hey world, I've had enough!"" The rest of Nine Times happens on the upswing, starting with the utterly optimistic sing-along ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up."" A counterpart to ""Turn the Radio Off"" in a way, the song acknowledges How Things Are, but grants ""I think I'll stay all day in bed"" a positivity ""Radio"" previously denied. ""Busy Doing Nothing"" takes nervous pleasure in the out-of-sight, out-of-mind getting-over-you process-- ""Five movie marathons! Nine times that same song!""-- and another deceptive stop/start and smart key change make this song the most exciting one on the album. The pretty two-speed romance ballad ""Felt Tip"" flirts with obscurities (stuff about ""spray cans"" and ""finger tips"" and ""step right on the beat""), but that's romance is it not? A conflation of meta-metaphors and the prowl, this song about graffiti never says, brilliantly, ""The writing's on the wall."" And then we're back again, in the frenzy of the fresh and young, ""clapping hands up in the air,"" saying yeah, unraveling your reactions. The band could have ended Nine Times-- a bit solipsistic but deservedly so-- on the lonely what-to-do of ""Turn the TV Off"", the album's ninth song har-har. Too easy. In an album that's so anxiously avoided these types of cliches, the power-pop ditty ""Trying Too Hard"" truly seals the kiss with an afterthought: ""I was trying way too hard.""

Curtain Call: The Hits,Eminem,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc61eb335119a49ecc59/1:1/w_160/62da6a2d.jpg,2005-12-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2773-curtain-call-the-hits/,Interscope,"Frankly, I don't want to hear these songs anymore. Nothing personal, but are there people who think ""Without Me"" has resonance? Eminem has even worn himself out. It shows in interviews, and as he watches hard-won respect slip through his fingers whenever he shits out another scatological invective like ""Just Lose It"". He's been swindling his audience for some time now, milking stardom for all its goopy dairy: D12, the 2Pac album, the outrageously overrated 8 Mile, a cartoon, radio station, DVDs, and books. His most recent LP, Encore, was a shell, full of flow-fuckery and canny hooks, signifying nothing. Eminem's rise, in all its Great White Hope glory, paralleled the rise of modern hip-hop as America's dominant musical form. But it also happened mostly in conjunction with Em dipping into the pop well. It's a sad state of affairs now for someone who could have been the premier musical artist of the last decade. For all intents and purposes, Eminem's position as globo-mega-star and intriguing personality began to wane after the release of his second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, a record regarded by most as his masterpiece. But his 1999 debut The Slim Shady LP marked his creative zenith. Only two songs from that album are included here: the hits. ""My Name Is"" remains blissful and more complex than the novelty it was written off as-- it's funny and bizarre, and each punchline could have been a chorus. ""Guilty Conscience"", the role-playing jaunt between Eminem and mentor Dr. Dre, also holds up, especially when Em puts his producer on blast as ""somebody who slapped Dee Barnes."" Eminem's strengths-- verbal elasticity, the ability to write thunderous hooks, chameleon-ism, being white-- have hamstrung him psychologically, but in these early days, before fame, 65 million albums sold, and media persecution, his joy for rapping shone hard. From the moment Dre and Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine forced Eminem back into the booth to record ""The Real Slim Shady"", the cake icing on his colossally important second album, his fate was sealed. The songs Curtain Call culls from that album are fine, but had little to do with the outrage he caught from parents, GLAAD, and the conservative right. ""The Real Slim Shady"" made him profitable; songs like ""Kim"" and ""Kill You"" made him interesting. ""Stan"", however, still stands out as an exception. Overplayed as it may sound today, it remains a cultural milestone-- throngs of people, fans and not, flipped upon first hearing it, essentially forcing the label to release it as a single. All didn't end well, though: Dido has a career now. Third album The Eminem Show is repped here by two songs: ""Without Me"", and the underrated ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"", which contributed as much to the confusing Freudian glints in Em's persona as anything else he's done. Which leaves the compilation's four new throw-ins: the Nate Dogg collaboration ""Shake That"", the ridiculously inane ""FACK"", and new single ""When I'm Gone"" are all desolate placeholders-- lesser versions of Eminem songs that already piss me off. ""Gone"" is the worst offender, yet another love letter from Em to daughter Hailie, it, like Encore's ""Mockingbird"", is heavy-handed and saccharine. The final new track is the live version of ""Stan"", performed with Elton John at the 2001 Grammys. Its inclusion is pointless. Eminem has always had a self-loathing streak. He still comes across as uncomfortable with both stardom and his standing as a white rapper, and in a recent MTV interview seemed unhappy with this compilation's tracklist. This isn't his art-- it's his commerce. That's partly alleviated by Curtain Call's seven-track bonus CD, which contains five of the 10 best songs he's recorded. Included are two incredible album cuts from his debut, ""Role Model"" and ""Just Don't Give a Fuck"", one of his earliest, funniest thrillers. ""Kill You"", from his second LP, is psychotic mania but it's also hilarious and paramount to his dichotomy. Also featured are tracks he recorded with two giants: The first, ""Renagade"", comes from Jay-Z's The Blueprint, and finds each MC handling two liquid verses apiece. It's also a rare occasion in which Eminem's funeral dirge production doesn't sound overwrought. The other, Notorious B.I.G.'s posthumous ""Dead Wrong"", is about as vicious and beguiling a thing as I've ever heard, featuring both men pulling the razors out from under their tongues. The fact that Em stands toe-to-toe in the face of two potent Biggie verses was a sort of unofficial ""okay, we can all fuck with this dude"" moment for hardcore fans. Eminem was a battle rapper first, then a backpacker, then a hook-slinger, now a tortured artiste-- the last bastion of the overexposed. He's still a star, but he no longer seems nearly as fascinating as we've been made to think. And Curtain Call, an inevitable and adequate document of his hitmaking, allows him the opportunity to remain in the spotlight while also receding from it. And with that, he's back into hiding for the forseeable future, building mystique: His next album is unscheduled, and, promo for this collection aside, his profile never seems to rise above churning out goth-rap backing tracks for lesser artists. Which, of course, is all probably intended to get me wishing the guy who once pleaded, ""Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill,"" would come back around once in a while.","Hip-hop legend frustratingly collects the hits, saves some of his best work for a tack-on bonus disc, and adds a few mostly insignificant new tracks.

The Enemy of Love,Annie Hayden,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0855e6ef9596932356f/1:1/w_160/464c1a68.jpg,2005-12-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3778-the-enemy-of-love/,Merge,"Aspiring singer-songwriters take note: Accompaniment can make all the difference. Annie Hayden's voice-- a scratchy, paper-thin cooing (think Mirah's little sister)-- is barely strong enough to command a song on its own. I think Hayden realizes this. It may be a solo record, but The Enemy of Love isn't a singer's record-- it's a record of songs, where Hayden's voice is one of many carefully applied textures and tones, and what it lacks in strong vocal performances, it makes up for in craft. Hayden began her career in the slept-on Spent, and Love is her second solo record following 2001's The Rub. Hayden handles guitar and piano, drums are handed by Peter Retzlaff, and producer Glen Tarachow and various other ringers add extra percussion and instrumental color. More importantly, it's recorded without the help of former Spent-mate Jon King (who assisted on The Rub), so sink or swim, this one is distinctively her own record. Nearly all of these songs begin sparsely, with just Hayden's voice accompanied by one instrument. Just around the corner lies the barest intuitive application of drums or guitar that dramatically alters the tone of the track. Opener ""Cara Mia"" begins with innocuous acoustic strumming, before a trebly guitar line precedes the metronome tick of the drums, and a coffeehouse performance turns into a professional courting. ""Your Carnival"" has a barebones piano intro, but the band cautiously dials up the pressure and when it should boil over in the chorus, it becomes cool come-hither pop with icy keyboards and clear, muted chords. The approach should grow predictable, but the additions are so minimal it surprises every time. The disc is not without its missteps. Labeling yourself a ""singer-songwriter"" and getting all grown up from indie rock does not mean you can get away with sounding like Ben Folds circa 2005 (the maudlin ""Staring at the Movies""), sandpapering all the grit from the Replacements' ""Swingin Party"", or beginning a song with the question ""How's the weather in your guitar?"" (""Guitar""). You shouldn't let the label on the spine fool you into thinking Enemy Of Love is unconventional or indie in any way but despite the missteps, Hayden finds her voice without forgetting to turn in a tasteful, carefully detailed record.","Merge issues the second solo album from the former co-leader of Spent.

The Sound of Revenge,Chamillionaire,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74aea9e61561daa5556/1:1/w_160/b80bf306.jpg,2005-12-04 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1823-the-sound-of-revenge/,Interscope,"The first thing you need to know about Chamillionaire is that he's one of the greatest rappers on the planet, sly and quick-tongued with perfect timing and better punchlines than first-album Eminem, and he has a sticky-sweet deadpan singing voice that nails hooks like Nate Dogg. In 2003, he and Paul Wall released Get Ya Mind Correct, one of the best Southern rap albums ever. Everything that everyone ever says about 3 Feet High and Rising is even more true about Get Ya Mind Correct: smartass dorks tossing goofy-sharp jokes back and forth, bringing a sense of play to a genre not known for it and sidestepping their lack of hardness by making light of it, even celebrating it. Paul's clumsy charm makes him a valuable foil, but it's all Chamillionaire, crooning the hooks and wrapping his irresistible liquid flow around sunburst Houston-synth beats, getting in all the best lines: ""They said rap was a waste of knowledge, 'Take ya ass to college'/ Now they broke asses call us, try to ask for dollars."" A lot has happened since 2003. Soon after Cham and Paul split from each other and began quietly feuding, the rap world discovered Houston, and Cham signed a solo deal with Universal. When you're one of the greatest rappers in the world, you're going to be facing some pressure when you're releasing the first solo album of your career. And even if your sense of humor is your primary strength, you might decide that you want to be taken seriously. Get Ya Mind Correct was great partly because it followed no formats and pandered to no audiences; it's mostly just about cars. But on The Sound of Revenge, Cham makes a common mistake: He tries to be all things to all people, making songs for every rap audience. He touches all the bases: love-rap (""Grown and Sexy""), club-rap (""Peepin' Me""), street-rap (""No Snitching""). The fill-in-the-blanks approach kept Cham's fellow Houston MC Bun B's solo debut Trill from being the classic it should've been, and it has the same effect here. Cham smothers his sense of humor and only gives rare glimpses of his personality. It's all solid, but it's never transcendent. On ""Southern Takeover"", Killer Mike becomes possibly the first rapper ever to outshine Cham on a track; that wouldn't have happened two years ago. But it's always a joy to hear Cham's effortlessly slippery flow even when he's not playing to his strengths. And a few tracks on the album show that Cham is at least maturing in the right direction. On ""Rain"", a gorgeous piano-laced, Scarface-assisted soul track, Cham gets inspirational: ""Tired of being poor, trying to leave the rats/ Walk out to see that three of your tires would be on flat/ And that one tire left's a sign of hope/ That helps you keep on grinding when you're kinda broke."" If Cham can give us an entire album as powerful as ""Rain"" next time, he'll have another classic on the level of Get Ya Mind Correct.","Sly, quick-tongued Houston emcee and former partner with Paul Wall trades candy paint for more serious subjects.

Kosi Comes Around,DJ Koze,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb69c0084474cd0c2854/1:1/w_160/ae156cf5.jpg,2005-12-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2543-kosi-comes-around/,Kompakt,"Stefan Kozalla comes from Hamburg, so maybe that explains his distance from the middle-aged-man-funk of the rest of Kompakt's Cologne-based output. He also got his start as a hip-hop DJ, which explains his DJ sets, full of hard edits, scratching, and ghetto-tech odes to popping that pussy alongside the standard issue melodic tech-house. His 2004 mix All People is My Friends opened with the Langley Schools Music Project before getting down to ""business"" with Farben and Mathew Jonson. As Adolf Noise, he's recorded everything from grating punk-techno to a drunken seaside cover of ""We Are the World"" with himself doing all the voices. As one-third of International Pony he's made two discs of post-Daft Punk pop dance, one released on a major label. Which is why the relatively straight melodic house and techno of Kosi Comes Around is such a pleasant surprise. It's a rather risky gambit, considering he's built most of his rep so far on stepping outside genre conventions. ""Don't Feed the Cat"" jacks along on little more than its own percussive momentum, reminding us that for all the home listening rhetoric that rightly gets thrown around with dance music CDs, its power is still rooted in the rhythmic. ""The Geklöppel Continues"" blurs the line between harmonic and rhythmic entirely, as the melody is hammered with such force that it becomes part of the beat. ""My Grandmotha"" is a bit like a house music Boards of Canada, with tiny melodic chunks swirling wistfully. ""Estrella"" likewise plonks itself squarely in the Kompakt tradition of chugging, dewy melancholy. The album climaxes with the strange 2003 anthem ""Brutalga Square"", a trawl through a dark, dank German sewer full of bass, lots of negative space, and strange, rattling offbeats. This is still Koze's most famous track, nearly 10 minutes of ridiculously tense brooding with no release. After the pleasing, warm music of most of Kosi Comes Around, this plunge into the underworld is disorienting, like suddenly being stranded in a long, dark tunnel. The very bright light at the end comes with ""Chiminea"", a sweetly lilting comedown that floats us out to sea. The Hamburglar himself winks at us as his balloon sails over the sunset, pleased as punch that there's still life left in a twenty year old genre. While I appreciate all his half-soldered bedroom experiments and flashy way with a crossfader, I'm pretty pleased with the results.","Debut LP from one of Kompakt's more underrated producers is also the label's best artist album of the year.

Book of Sand,Tarantula A.D.,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b1b1335d7bf169933d/1:1/w_160/6355d629.jpg,2005-12-04 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8308-book-of-sand/,Kemado,"For their first full-length, Book of Sand, prog-chamber trio Tarantula A.D. withheld nothing from their daring but cumbersome experiments in musical husbandry. Combining classical instrumentation and techniques with elements of metal, flamenco, and various pan-global folk forms, the group eagerly succumbs to their every outsized whim. Wearing their lofty art-rock pretensions with a theatrical Centurion pride, Tarantula A.D. ultimately prove unable to bring their epic vision into any degree of focus and fail to keep their numerous plates spinning in balance. Though predominantly instrumental, Book of Sand has the look and feel of a rock opera, lacking only a cohesive libretto. This impression is accentuated by the album's ambitious structure, which features a two-act piece entitled ""Who Took Berlin"" interlocked with a grandiose trilogy called ""The Century"", as well as a generous handful of preludes and intermezzos. At any rate, Tarantula A.D.'s three group members-- Danny Bensi, Saunder Jurriaans, and Gregory Rogove-- are all obviously musicians of skill, and each of them here plays multiple instruments, so rarely does the album sound like the work of a mere trio. Adding further depth of field are vocal cameos supplied by CocoRosie's Sierra Cassidy, Inouk's Alexander and Damon McMahon, and the omnipresent Devendra Banhart. With their shared appreciation for virtuosic bombast, classical music and heavy metal have long made strangely cozy bedfellows, but theirs is a union that seldom rewards a peek through the keyhole. Such is unfortunately the case on Book of Sand's opening track, ""Century Trilogy I: Conquest"", as the lyrical strains of Bensi's solo violin soon give way to black cape-twirling, gong-shaking power chords. So it continues on ""Who Took Berlin (Part I)"", portions of which sound something like a troupe of gypsies absconding with Metallica's ""Sad But True"". On these and Book of Sand's other more amplified segments, Tarantula A.D.'s use of metal textures sounds oddly self-conscious and mannered, almost as though they're more comfortable using the genre as a seasoning rather than as a main ingredient, thus never allowing their music's varied flavors to become fully integrated. Even more problematic is the set-closing saga ""The Century Trilogy III: The Fall"", which features Devendra Banhart's dubious contribution. In a performance seemingly designed to fuel his detractors, Banhart here plays resolutely against his strengths, adding a series of operatic trills and ululation to Tarantula A.D.'s vaguely North African-tinged prog-odyssey, resulting in a wildly ineffective track that stands as the surest evidence yet that the singer just might benefit from a sabbatical. Faring much better is the Sierra Cassidy-sung ""Sealake"", which features her quiet multi-tracked cooing over an eerie bed of chimes and scraped strings. As evidenced by this expertly understated track, Tarantula A.D. are at their best when they choose a single style and ride it for the whole length of a song, a method that also pays nice dividends on the extended Debussy-like piano composition ""The Lost Waltz"", and the gritty tango of ""Palo Borracho"". The only catch is that, when played in isolation, each of these highlights sounds like the creation of completely different act. So until Tarantula A.D. can find a way to unite their many disparate musical ideas into a single congruent narrative, perhaps their work is best experienced in clip form, on a scene-by-scene basis.","Debut LP from the prog-chamber trio combines classical instrumentation and techniques with elements of metal, flamenco, and various pan-global folk forms, and features appearances by Devendra Banhart and CocoRosie's Sierra Cassidy.

If Songs Could Be Held,Rosie Thomas,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a788c0084474cd0c0bf1/1:1/w_160/3eb6cfe3.jpg,2005-12-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8022-if-songs-could-be-held/,Sub Pop,"Tricky thing about music is, judgment's impaired when we're vain enough to think songs are about us: when puppy love turns train wreck and the only movies worth watching spotlight John Cusack way down in the drippy-nose dumps-- every song seems worthy to weep to, and Sarah McLachlan (or worse-- Vanessa Carlton, anybody?) sings volumes to smarting souls. So maybe Sub Pop signed songstress Rosie Thomas is Sarah McLachlan for the hipster haircut set; maybe her 2002 debut, When We Were Small, wasn't much more than mouthpiece of shy girls, given up on love, meant to flip boys off. If that's the case, it's arguably the cutest flying middle finger Sub Pop's ever seen (""So much for love, I guess/ I've been wronged but it's all right/ Cause I'm moving on/ I'm gonna drive over hills over mountains/ And canyons and boys that keep bringing me down""). Revisited, ""Bicycle Tricyle""'s still as gently lovely as it is inspiring (""I can't be the homecoming queen/ To every boy who falls in love with me""), and Thomas' voice is still the prettiest, honey-logged thing; but in the end, When We Were Small was little more than fleeting moments-- and followup Only with Laughter Can You Win fell into similar ruts. Thankfully, Thomas, a former Seattle resident, recognized the danger in sounding like she does, and moved to L.A. to record her third Sub Pop release, If Songs Could Be Held, where inspiration was scheduled to strike, but passed her over. It's too bad nothing's new a third time around either, and Thomas-- gorgeous, emotive voice and all-- could still make for some teen sitcom backdrop, provided it's something like the late ""Dawson's Creek"". Maybe it's just that lives come in motifs, and recycle themselves, but talk of uncertain futures, homecoming queens, and outerwear needs no repeating. To its credit, ""Pretty Dress"" sounds unique-- kinda like Alanis Morisette doing ""Smooth Criminal""-- for better or worse. The effort's there, but when Thomas records ""Let It Be Me"" with Ed Harcourt, they end up floundering like a pair of white kids trying to pass as Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong. Last words of lines are too-easily guessable, but lyrics are best summed up in the familiar ones of ""Time Goes Away"": ""How do we make these moments last/ How do we get them to stay/ When everything passes and time goes away?"" It's as easy as rhyming ""crying"" with ""dying"" (see ""Death Came and Got Me"")-- as easy, maybe, as singer/songwriter stints come, requisite heartache aside. Still, time passing's the stuff of Virginia Woolf, and feelings like ""What can I say/ What can I do/ I'm still in love/ Why aren't you?"" and ""I remember what you used to feel like/ See how much has changed"" are basic but beautifully recognizable. There's the potential for something here; as of If Songs Could Be Held, it's yet unrealized.","This album from the Sub Pop songstress is her first since moving to L.A.

Memento,Dead Can Dance,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c9b1335d7bf169937a/1:1/w_160/553d2def.jpg,2005-12-01 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2212-memento/,4AD,"The much-maligned category ""World Music"" seems to have been invented for Dead Can Dance. From the beginning, Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard thought of their work in global terms, as music from any latitude and any era was fair game for appropriation and assimilation into their distinctive musical vision. Somehow, because they never lost sight of core aesthetic principals that began with their dark self-titled debut in 1984, their borrowing never seemed displeasingly imperialistic or slanted toward cultural tourism. They cared about the music that interested them and they had an intuitive understanding of how it would fit into the Dead Can Dance project. Representative samples of almost every Dead Can Dance style can be found on this, the fourth Dead Can Dance collection and third since Perry and Gerrard parted ways in 1999. There's the soft, ethereal ambience of ""Ariadne"" which would really begin to flower when Gerrard turned her attention to film soundtracks. There's the intense, ritualistic Near East vocalizations on ""Cantara"", which finds Gerrard unleashing the full power of her amazing voice in a cavernous Wall of Sound production driven by tribal drums. ""Enigma of the Absolute"" from 1985's Spleen and Ideal is an excellent showcase of the band at its most gothic, with the deeply echoing production conjuring images of a medieval cathedral as dusk. Other tracks impress simply with the strength of the tunes. On ""The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove"" Perry seamlessly blends instruments from a handful of different cultures-- sitar, antara, guitar, synth, violin-- and make them work together in a conventionally Western songwriting style that could easily be translated to a rock context. Further into the pure singer-songwriter direction is Perry's voice-and-guitar showcase ""American Dreaming"", which I remember being on regular rotation on post-Nirvana ""alternative"" radio in 1995. Though the sonic experience of the band was a large part of their appeal, Dead Can Dance didn't need exotic production to get over. Memento is the fourth Dead Can Dance compilation and the third since Perry and Gerrard parted ways in 1999, but it's the only single-disc set spanning their entire career. Actually, ""entire career"" is not quite accurate, since it avoids the classically Goth debut album completely and focuses heavily on two early '90s albums that coincided with the band's breakthrough in the United States. Such a focus makes sense considering that Memento was conceived partly as a souvenir for those who came out for their recent reunion tour. Dead Can Dance was an intense band requiring a certain commitment, and for a lot a lot of people 70 minutes of prime music is all they will really need. For them this is definitely the place to start.","Compilation of the most memorable releases from the famed 4AD duo, which moved between soft, ethereal ambience and intense, ritualistic vocalizations and Wall of Sound production.

The Beginning of the End of the World,As Mercenárias,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d29d034d5c69bf2a4c/1:1/w_160/5398f712.gif,2005-12-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/492-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-world/,Soul Jazz,"There's hardly a more romantic image in globalized rock: a quartet of journalism students in São Paulo, performing Sid Vicious covers and spewing sarcastic critiques of Figueiredo's presidency in clipped Portuguese. No wonder As MercexE1rias are largely responsible for the ego-stroking interest in Brazilian post-punk (as exemplified by the excellent comps The Sexual Life of the Savages and Não Wave). The group matured and vanished in the span of only six years and two albums, leaving a reputation analogous to that of the Pop Group or Kleenex: obscure and original subterraneans whose legacies were tarnished by their more popular successors. Despite the band's recent notoriety, the MercexE1rias are perhaps unrepresentative of their native country's post-punk pantheon. First, they have less blatant allusions to funk- and reggae-inflected pop melodies of the 1970s. While Gang 90 and Nau churned fluttery lambada kitsch into dingy contusions, the MercexE1rias abided by clockwork minimalism, as precise and sober as systems analysts. Likewise, the band generally eschewed samba and bossa nova rhythms in favor of a constrained percussive tension. Lead singer Rosália Munhoz was famously ignorant of Música Popular Brasileira and preferred the plastered rancor and aloof satire of the Raincoats, Joy Division, and PiL. The result is a distinctly sour-- and British-- amalgam of gloom, ire, and anxiety. Even the lyrics traffic in sloganeering cynicism (""solitude is a fact!""). Their first release toggles crazily between poetic abstraction (the existential gibberish on ""Me Perco"") and reflexive anti-authority populism (the anthemic preadolescence of ""Polícia""). The Beginning of the End of the World, the first full-length easily available in the U.S., collects the MercexE1rias' 1986 debut, Cad\xEA As Armas?, and half of the tracks from 1988's Trashland. While Armas may be more petulant than similar Brazilian records from the early '80s, it deliberately lacks the sheer dissonance often associated with its North American counterparts. In fact, guitarist Ana Machado owes more to stoner psych: The debut teems with laggard fuzz, shuffled drones and bruised metal. ""Pânico"" features sparkling surf reverb, and ""Loucos Sentimentos"" mutilates stammering guitars on an otherwise innocuous amateur session. Every song is under two minutes, and the band is clearly struggling to compress its excesses into palatable punk. Trashland is another story entirely: hi-fi, downbeat, and lathered in heavy globs of venom. There's less militant rage and juvenile apathy, and no further attempts to suppress the band's idiosyncrasies. Munhoz transforms her sterile yelp into incantational jazz. Mouthfuls of acid surf roll in the background. Automated vocals hex fiery keyboard clusters in EMI-produced clarity. On ""Há Dez Anos Passados"", the band is nearly overwhelmed by its quirks: demonic grinding, berserk bicycle horns, and snippets of Fair Warning-era shredding. If it's truly a sign o' the times, one must assume São Paulo spent the decade imprisoning killers and clowns. Sadly, World excises most of Trashland's more tender moments (""Angelus,"" ""MatixEA""), as though only frantic DFA-influencing party jams were suitable for inclusion. The timing of the release is also suspect. The MercexE1rias, now grayed and reunited after a 16-year hiatus, have been strutting through Brazil's TV studios in loopy leopard-skin outfits. Considering the States' propensity for Pan-American punk, I doubt we'll hear much about their impending tour and album. For now-- and until the Baltic no-wave market takes off-- this is yet another admirably warped reflection of the North's most endearingly snobbish genre.","Venerable reissue imprint Soul Jazz collects the best from this 1980s Brazilian post-punk group.

"Okie Dokie, It's the Orb on Kompakt",The Orb,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f75e6ef95969322ab4/1:1/w_160/668f10b6.jpg,2005-12-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6029-okie-dokie-its-the-orb-on-kompakt/,Kompakt,"Dammit, there went my first sentence: As the title of the Orb's new album indicates, the pairing of one of UK rave's most legendary acts with Cologne, Germany's techno powerhouse Kompakt is the kind of marriage that gets Discogs junkies all hot and bothered. But as any cat-number addict could tell you, this is not the first but the sixth Orb outing on Kompakt since 2002 (preceded by the ""Kompassion"", ""Komplott"", and ""Komfort"" singles-- lord knows what those guys would do if their ""k"" key broke-- plus a Speicher side and an appearance on Pop Ambient 2005). It's worth asking, though, especially for an outfit that's recorded for dozens of labels across its 17-year, many-membered history: Why does any of this matter? Probably the most notable thing about the Orb's increasingly frequent residencies on Kompakt is that the group seems to be rotating back to its German side. The Orb, and especially its chemical enthusiast co-founder Dr. Alex Paterson, may be thought of as a quintessentially English project, synonymous with acid house and Balearic ambient weirdness, but from the beginning they were looking East: As early as 1993 Paterson's WAU label released ""Ploy"", from Basic Channel member Maurizio, and before that, in 1989, Paterson's A&R; work for Brian Eno's E'G imprint led to collaborations between E'G and Thomas Fehlmann's Teutonic Beats label (which itself had its eye on Detroit). Berlin's Fehlmann came aboard the Orb in 1994, and he's been a steady presence in the inner circle ever since; no doubt his own releases on Kompakt helped pave the way for this eureka-deeka moment. In the end, Okie Dokie has Fehlmann's swirly fingerprints all over it, from the stubby keyboards and schaffel rhythms of ""Cool Harbor"" to the ambient oompah of the opening ""Komplikation"", which sounds a little like moon-stomping in the Mariana Trench. Fehlmann's trademark eddies-- fading loops and spiraling delay spun into hypnotic sequences-- run through Okie Dokie from surface to seafloor, and it's his dub rhythms and fondness for density, washing everything with shifting layers of sound, that describes the album's overall aesthetic. (Also notable are the titles: Fehlmann's frequent aquatic metaphors run through ""Ripples"" and ""Cool Harbour"", while ""Snowbow"" echoes Fehlmann's recent Plug Research album, Lowflow.) Paterson has taken on so many guises and collaborators over the years that it's difficult to say where he is in the picture, aside from the occasional vocal loop and sample (like ""Lunik TM""'s ""Gotta be free,"" drawled with a dry abandon that recalls classic Primal Scream). Then again, that same track pulls in cycling wind instruments that, if not sampled directly from Steve Reich, might as well be-- and it was Reich's ""Electric Counterpoint"" that anchored the Orb's biggest hit, 1991's ""Little Fluffy Clouds"". Trading classic Orb's celestial aspirations for a glass-bottomed boat, Okie Dokie announces a new port of call, but familiar tides run through it. Listeners expecting nu-Kompakt's bombastic trance or poptastic indulgences might be put off by Okie Dokie's heavy water-- even though gently skanking whisper-anthems like ""Kan Kan"" and ""Ripples"" could, properly timed, flood a heaving dance floor. But those who remember M:1:5's eerie polyrhythms on pre-Kompakt Profan, or Dettinger's slurry dream-techno will find that having the Orb on Kompakt makes perfect sense, a bit like an astral body returning to a favored house after a long, elliptical journey.","Dr. Alex Patterson's first full-length for Kompakt is full of eerie polyrhythms and slurry dream-techno.

Special Herbs 9 + 0,Metal Fingers,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c52bc0084474cd0c36b5/1:1/w_160/ad8673a5.jpg,2005-11-30 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5616-special-herbs-9-0/,Shaman Work,"Daniel Dumile, the man behind the metal, whether of Face or Fingers, is one of those artists whose hustle is so ingrained that his releases seem to have less to do with the people's appeasement than with his need to clear mental space. He's prolific to the point where he's often docked points for not letting us forget about him for a minute, yet his output is rarely, if ever, disappointing or boring. To keep it fresh, he sidles up to the zeitgeist to hover over Madlib's cobwebs or paw at Dangermouse's fleet beats with Garfield mumbles. When he can't find a collaborator, he raps about his dinner or changes his costume. All that to say that it's usually his lyrics that are on display or in demand, his production getting less notice because the words are a maze. To remind everyone that he is indeed a formidable producer, Dumile quietly releases a volume of Special Herbs from time to time. Each is a collection of instrumentals, some previously-released backing tracks from his or other's albums, some unreleased beat sketches or stand-alone compositions. 9 + 0 feels more substantial than previous volumes, though, partially due to the upped quality of the unreleased material, but also because of the conspicuous selection of old tunes. This latest edition starts off with ""Vinca Rosea""-- each song is named or renamed after a homeopathic medicine, usually one that soothes the bowels or eases depression-- an organ(ic) soul bouncer propelled by the mmm's and ohh's of a dusty female vocal loop, followed by the late-Doobie-ish piano and willowy keyboard line of ""Burdock Root"". Elsewhere, previously unreleased songs ""Bergamont"" and ""Yellow Dock"" prove Doom's taste for shrill brass and woodwind, with horns and clarinets crying all over chopped drums. But it's ""Coca Leaf"", the lone stimulatingly titled song, that makes one wonder how many epics Dumile's got stocked. ""Coca"" is massive. It thunders down with a conflation of resolute gospel chants, a pummeling breakbeat, tumbling organ and piano hammers, and an outraged female vocal sample in an overt call-to-arms track without being all ""Jesus Walks"" on you. Hopefully, someone will see the title and do a drug rap over it, but it's so outsized that most rappers would cower. Or possibly, it's being saved for the secretive Ghostface/Doom union? That's the point with these things; they are both career retrospective and future teaser, Doom's chance to show his skills extending endlessly over the timeline. Some instrumentals from past volumes resurfaced on subsequent records, but not all. See how fun Doom is? He's the rap Monty Hall. The real gems on 9 + 0, though, are the classic instrumentals, heretofore unavailable in compact disc or mp3 format. ""Podina"" is ""?"", a very rollerskate-y jam from Doom's first post-KMD album, Operation Doomsday. The beatboxed victory parade of King Geedorah's ""The Fine Print"" returns on ""Untitled (Meditation)"", and ""I Wonder"", also from Geedorah, extracts Hassan Chop's introspective lyrics, leaving the doleful strings standing in the raixC9 without an umbrellaÉ or galloshes. However, it's the final ""known"" beat that seals it. This whole Doom, Viktor, Metal, King saga began with two brothers and a kid with a killer high-top fade. Back then, it was Zev Love X, DJ Subroc, and Onyx The Birthstone Kid. It was the scrawny Dumile brothers in kufis and the tall, smooth dude, kicking it to girls over a card table covered in essential oils and incense. Riding bikes in the neighborhood, Subroc sitting on the handlebars and Serch carving shit in his hair in one of the classic videos of early ""Yo!MTV"", Fab 5 early. I've listened to ""Peachfuzz"" from KMD's debut Mr. Hood literally 8 billion times, and I've listened to the instrumental ""Peach Extract"" a million more. It's inclusion here feels like closure, like Daniel Dumile is cool with it being out there, remembering it. Maybe it's not that big of a deal. Maybe it's just one of my favorite songs, and I like trying to remember all the lyrics. Regardless, it's here, and that's good.","Latest collection of MF Doom instrumentals-- some previously-released backing tracks from his or other's albums, some unreleased beat sketches or stand-alone compositions.

The Very Best Of,Men's Recovery Project,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36d13d197565213bd1f/1:1/w_160/38508ff4.jpg,2005-11-30 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5668-the-very-best-of/,5RC,"It's weird to imagine, now that everyone and their brother considers Devo and the Residents and every jackoff noise chancer in history part of ""the continuum,"" but people were pretty hostile to Men's Recovery Project when they crawled out of the wreckage of Born Against. As their early singles landed on the desks of ungrateful reviewers for MRR or Heartattack, people scoffed and snooted. There was the stink of ""art"" about it, you see. So the band did the only classy thing and recorded a Regan Youth tribute 7"" on Kill Rock Stars with lyrics about The New York Times and riding in boats and aeroplanes. From this reviewer's admittedly tweaked perspective, their The Golden Triumph of Naked Hostility compilation is one of the key documents of the 1990s. (So buy that first.) A track like ""Man, Urinating Laughter""-- collected here on the LOL-iciously titled The Very Best Of along with 40 other tracks-- is just what it says on the tin. There's the sound of piss hitting porcelain and some very creepy canned laughter. ""The Couch"" is a monologue about a living loveseat that absorbs the feelings and lives of those who sit upon it, only to expire, heartbroken. Between the cracked electronics, occasional flailing hardcore guitar, and Sam McPheeter's hectoring delivery (performing from under a trash bag or in a Revolutionary War costume), I can only imagine the audience's response when they opened for Autechre. The work MRP and other acts on McPheeter's Vermiform label were vomiting up in the late 90s now feels very prescient in a world where Load is the new Merge (or something). ""Thaw Walt"" is about just that, as McPheeters imagines travelling to the underground Nazi bunker where Mr. Disney is frozen until such a time where he can take over the world. ""Get Your Dick Out of My Food"" confronts an interloper who doesn't understand that ""it is to eat, not to saut\xDA your fucking meat."" Most of the time there's not much to the songs beyond what their titles imply, as on the cave-funk of ""Manhole"" or their chanted titular anthem. Some of the more, um, considered tracks from their Middle Eastern ""concept record"" Boldies over Basra, like ""In Khartoum"" and ""Egyptian Assassin"", feel out of place divorced from their original context and surrounded by stuff like a 30-second ode to one-time bass player Joe Preston. ""Why We Are Lazy"" contains their non-manifesto: because the future goes to the bovine and the slothful, of course, and it's the wheat that gets the shaft and the chaff that always rises. If this was Entertainment Weekly or I wanted to be cheap, I'd pull out tired names-that-have-become-adjectives like ""Lynchian"" or ""Daliesque"". But for all their keeeeerazy, man affectations, MRP are shot through with a pathos and humanity that too often gets glossed over. As they summarized in a track title (from the aptly titled Resist the New Way), their music was about ""The Awful People in the Empty City"", about trying to make sense of a wold where I'm not the crazy one, you're the crazy one. The whole damn system's out of order. Tilt. Check please.","5RC presents a 40-track comp from this post-Born Against, Residents-like group.

Coming on Strong,Hot Chip,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c189c0084474cd0c3363/1:1/w_160/86a21835.jpg,2005-11-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4028-coming-on-strong/,Astralwerks,"Bedroom laptop thug-pop. Electro-ironic soul music. Tongue-in-ass hip-hop. DF-Ay-Ay-Ay! There are all sorts of wonky titles we could create to describe Hot Chip, Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor's perplexing electronic British outfit. Hell, Goddard even looks like a mellow James Murphy. Their full-length debut, Coming on Strong, was released in Europe more than a year ago and warmly if not exasperatingly received. This slightly reconfigured U.S. issue comes off at first like slight pop-- novelty even. But extended listens reveal a goofy sincerity and romantic insouciance. Hot Chip wear influences like yellow Livestrong bracelets-- quietly, gallantly, but a bit too noticeably. The Beach Boys, Prince, Ween, 60s girl groups, Dr. Dre, Devo, Stevie Wonder, Madlib: Each hallmark has their moment, or idea borrowed. The sum of inspiration isn't always rectitude, but Hot Chip make it work for them. American heavyweight counterparts LCD Soundsystem, a more forceful, knowing act, are clearly an influence, and ""Down With Prince"" is Hot Chip's ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"". Admiration is draped all over the production-- clipped hollow snares, noodly bass line, funk keyboards-- and it's impressive that they don't get us rolling on the ground with an opener like ""I'm sick of motherfuckers tryna tell me that they're down with Prince."" The desperate Purple allegiance is pretty apparent though. Someone oughta FedEx this record to Paisley Park. These guys have the gall. ""Keep Fallin'"" is the big scandal (""I'm like Stevie Wonder, but I can see things."") and the funniest thing here. Built on a simple groove, Taylor, whose fragile vocals guide much of the album, drops all kinds of bombs on us. He nods at obvious lyrical influence Ween and daintily moans ""Give up all you suckers, we the tightest motherfuckers and you never seen this before, now."" The decision to end many of the unrhyming couplets with ""now"" usually signals amateur. Hard to say how much Taylor and Goddard are lampooning things, though. The whole pop-satire gag is a tidy little safety net to throw at critics. Chemical Brothers meets Art Brut or something like that. The synthesis isn't perfect yet though, like on the groan-worthy ""Shining Escalade"". Some of the melodies, the mortar of these attacks, are occasionally less than cocked, as well: They're all simple, keyboard-based splashes and once in a while the bottom of the paper bag gets too wet. Lyrics are sung so delicately-- fogged up in the cushiness of the production-- it's hard to make out the gangsta-lite gags. This complicates the consternation over whether these guys are ""serious"" or not. But in a world where 12-year-olds quote 50 Cent to their aunties at Thanksgiving dinner, it's not hard to understand why Goddard, the rap fan with the baritone, would consider dropping a chorus like the one on ""Playboy"": ""Driving in my Peugeot, yeah yeah yeah/ 20-inch rims with the chrome now, yeah yeah yeah/ Blazin' out Yo La Tengo, yeah yeah yeah."" Everyone likes everything these days, Cam'Ron to Ira Kaplan. That's why a group like this makes sense. It's what separates them from the likes of Goldie Lookin' Chain and Kidz Bop. Hot Chip's songs are lazy, or at least leisurely, but they're unafraid to roll up on you in the most unsuspecting ways. ""Keep Fallin'"" ends with a kazoo solo. ""Baby Said"" closes madly, with 30 seconds of honking Casio and buckwild kick-drumming after four minutes of parlor room mellifluousness. It's only really a tease, flirting with the concept of upbeating their sound. Four on the floor quaking seems to be their next goal. Hot Chip's new album, scheduled for a 2006 release, already has the danceteria types excited just on the strength of lead single ""Over and Over"" b/w with, fittingly, the DFA Remix of ""Just Like We (Breakdown)."" So, enjoy serenity now. The backbeat reigns supreme soon.","Long-awaited U.S. release from this at times perplexing electronic British outfit, who come across like a mellow, hip-hop-lovin' version of LCD Soundsystem.

Horses [30th Anniversary Legacy Edition],Patti Smith,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4799d034d5c69bf3097/1:1/w_160/9f977e73.gif,2005-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/,Arista,"Patti Smith sounded both young and old on her 1975 debut, Horses: young because only a young punk can slink into the spotlight and sell an opening line like, ""Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine""; old, because she was dead serious and sophisticated, an ur-punk but also a poetess and a singer who knew to stop this close to overindulgence. Like her hero Jim Morrison she wrote absurd verses more fit for a diary than a rock 'n' roll record, but could also follow them with lines that genuinely terrified. Smith is the fountainhead for the punks, grrrls, rockers, and artists that have worn the shit out of this record in their most raw, needy hours, and who study and mimic everything she does with that voice-- which is all rends, tears, and bite marks, and no clean cuts. So it feels cheap not to put this fully on a pedestal, even if ""Land""'s meandering free verse makes a poor bookend for the enraged lust of ""Gloria"", and ""Elegie"" is a turgid closer. The flaws don't matter: Horses is an album of its time-- not because it's dated, but because it precariously captures a phase in Smith's life, and when all the raw elements fall in place, it feels miraculous. Take ""Birdland"". Just like in a jazz ballad, you can practically hear the band breathing in sync, and the slightest misjudgment would screw up the flow of Smith's surreal-- but straightforwardly powerful-- poem. But Lenny Kaye's guitar stretches effortlessly from post-funeral ballad to ecstatic, crazy fury, and Smith's performance is fierce and horribly unbeautiful. ""It was as if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars/ 'Cause when he looked up they started to slip."" Holy God is she a poet, and she hurls those words so accurately you want to scream and give up too. That was 30 years ago. Today, Smith is unavoidably grown up, stuck in the canon, and well defined, and that's the artist we hear on the bonus disc in this package, a live track-by-track recital of Horses from the Meltdown Festival in London, this past June. She took the stage with old friends Tom Verlaine and Lenny Kaye on guitar and Jay Dee Daugherty on drums. They knocked the roof off-- but they don't match the original. ""Birdland"" is fitful and noisy, the segue from ""Lands"" back to a ""Gloria"" reprise seems like a cop-out, and Smith's wild poetess thing has settled into something a little more, hey, settled, like when she complains about how much time we spend on email and Blackberrys. ""Elegie"" takes far more meaning now that she has a list of loved ones to commemorate, like Robert Mapplethorpe, or her own husband. But play it back to back with the debut, and instead of a transformative force, you hear an old familiar voice cranking about George Bush. Here's the thing about growing up: You don't know when it happens until later, but if you could catch it, it would be an amazingly quick moment-- like the point where you toss a ball in the air and it comes to a complete halt before it starts to fall to the ground. When we talk about youth and rock and roll, we're looking for that moment, of not being one thing or the other but of straddling both, of making mistakes that are above and beneath us, of a crest of energy as the ball gets ready to stop. We're talking about Smith changing from the twentysomething poet who decided to add guitar to her readings, and about an artist who can ape the last generation even as she spawns the next one. Or a performance like her old take of ""My Generation"", where she and John Cale knock the shit out of the by-then-ancient Who classic and Smith wraps with the wail, ""I'm so young, I'm so goddamn young""-- and she's still, barely, right.","New York poetess and singer's proto-punk classic is reissued with a live track-by-track recital of the LP, recorded this past June, tacked on as a bonus.

Rollin in the Ruins,Get Hustle,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf0feb335119a49ed171/1:1/w_160/7ff950b0.jpg,2005-11-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3429-rollin-in-the-ruins/,Three-One-G,"Rollin' in the Ruins recreates the sleazy skronk Get Hustle became known for on previous singles and the Earth Odyssey LP, but with one exception: no guitars. Guitarist Dave Stone left shortly after the band's first full length and they've decided not to replace him, raising their own sonic hell with bass, keyboards, and vocals alone. The band do a thorough job of exploring the outermost edges of its new limitations, and is perhaps even more abrasive here than on its previous LP. The first half of Ruins consists of brief, cacophonous pieces of avant-garde soul-pop reeking of poverty and madness; the second half is an extended jam, testing the limits of the band's ability and the listener's patience as singer Valentine Hussar warns and begs for the ""revolution van"" to come. The band has the instrumental prowess to back up the noise. The electric piano fills every possbile open space, complementing the rhythm while acting as a divining rod for dissonant incidental noise. Drummer Ron Avila flips tempos with ease and lays down sophisticated polyrhythms, though he's just as adept at locking into a primal groove. ""Brothers and Others"" is a concentrated taste of what they're capable of, moving fluidly from unpredicitable noise to headbang-worthy ryhthms without warning. Valentine's lyrics are like the babbling of a coma victim who woke up after 30 years and just cracked: easy riders, black cobras, Wattstax, Evel Knievel, towels with Elvis' name, and Jesus Christ Superstar flood her waking nightmares. Per ""Revolution Van"", she's self-admittedly ""full moon crazy."" She's a strong vocalist who ends up being the weak link here, with a wildly exaggerated diva act that doesn't quite cement the apocalyptic soul aesthetic her lyrics suggest, but is far too strong to idly complement these free-wheeling compositions. It's a distraction, a fight between musicianship and showmanship that Rollin' in the Ruins never resolves. There are only fleeting moments, like the first half of ""W.S.T.P"", when the band slows down and follows Valentine's lead, with a lurching understated beat that's gradually, systematically dismantled. The 14-minute closer, ""Don Quixote & I"", is the record's most minimal moment, anchored by a throbbing drum loop while reprising ""Revolution Van"" in it's lyrics (and pretty thoroughly at that-- I got tired of hearing the titular phrase around the ninth minute.) While the first nine or 10 minutes almost qualify as cabaret, an instrumental version would be even better: After hypnotically hammering past the point where most listeners would get restless, the drum pattern variates, revealing that maybe they were live all along. If you're a listener who thrives on this kind of orchestrated chaos, maybe you'll have the taste for this discordant vocalist/band conflict; to me, it sounds a like-minded trio rushing towards the same end without waiting up for one another.","Indie band recreates the sleazy skronk of its previous releases, but this time does so without guitars.

When the Detail Lost Its Freedom,Brian McBride,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36ec0084474cd0c3489/1:1/w_160/4c726754.jpg,2005-11-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5669-when-the-detail-lost-its-freedom/,Kranky,"Brian McBride is one half of Stars of the Lid, the quietest band you ever barely heard. The other half, Adam Wiltzie, is off making rock records with Windsor for the Derby at the moment, so McBride has stepped out on his own. Instead of exploring other sounds, as his partner has, McBride opted to go even deeper into the quiet on his solo debut. When the Detail Lost Its Freedom is the sound of beauty replacing silence, as drones and small musical figures rise into the void and recede, creating a sort of oceanic pulse. Sonically and emotionally, the result bears a fair resemblance to William Basinski's recent work (especially The Disintegration Loops), but the compositions are much more directed and detailed. It's an album derived mostly from recordings of organic sound-- violins, trumpets, pianos, guitars-- but it takes those basic elements and fashions them into timbres that are hard to pinpoint through processing. As such, it's often difficult to tell what instrument a sound is emanating from, and the whole thing has a kind of far-away, aquatic patina, the aural equivalent of pictures of whales skimming below the surface in daylight. Though the sound, instrumentation, and harmonic development vary from track to track, the basic premise of the music seems modeled on natural rhythms, like heartbeats and breathing, especially the latter. There are moments that sound like a grand piano heaving a sigh, exhausted from playing etudes all day. One exception stands way out from the rest, though: ""Our Last Moment in Song"" is a big, dreamy slo-core plodder moved along by rhythmic piano, slowly changing chords, whale-song guitars, and beyond-blissed vocals, mostly wordless. It's a little jarring coming in the middle of this record, actually, but it fits the tone if not the apparent mission of the rest of the tracks. When the Detail Lost Its Freedom is essentially an exploration of the slightly more varied territory immediately adjacent to the realm of majestic drone Stars of the Lid last left us in on the Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid. In it, he finds immense, enveloping beauty and the true power of a whisper.","Not an act named for the Fulham striker, but the solo record from one half of the Stars of the Lid.

Stubbs the Zombie OST,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7049d034d5c69bf36ba/1:1/w_160/b422cb6d.gif,2005-11-29 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7898-stubbs-the-zombie-ost/,Shout! Factory,"Indie-yuppie will eat your brains. Natalie Portman: ""I was proved fucking right!"" Stubbs the Zombie, the videogame, is a third-person cerebellum-gobbler starring Edward ""Stubbs"" Stubblefield, a long-slain traveling salesman hungry for revenge (and brains). Stubbs' tongue-cheeked horrorshow comes re-alive in a newsreel-grainy 1959 ""city of the future"" called Punchbowl. Stubbs the Zombie, the soundtrack, reanimates innocent late-1950s and early-'60s pop classics with present-day noises from still-breathing Pitchfork review victims. While video game music has grown increasingly vital-- spawning remixes, orchestral concert tours, and cover bands-- video game soundtrack albums have often stayed as stitched-together as the living dead. Discs might include instrumental suites (Stubbs progenitor Halo), ""inspired-by"" prog-metal (Halo 2), or vast assortments of licensed songs (Grand Theft Auto). While Stubbs isn't the first game soundtrack consisting of original pop/rock recordings-- earlier this year, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland challenged West Coast skate-punkers to exhume (and then attempt to cover) their punk forefathers-- it pairs a witty concept with mostly decent-or-better execution. Undeath becomes the unfunny recordings best-- at least outside of a game setting. The Walkmen imbue the Drifters' ""There Goes My Baby"" with their now-familiar windswept chill, restrained elegance echoing into raw anguish. Sock-hop pianos still kachink around the edges, but singer Hamilton Leithauser's soused rasp reaps greater pathos by omitting the dated ""whoa-oh-ohs"" of the heartbreaking original. Similarly, Death Cab for Cutie loses itself in the slow-dance sumptuousness of oft-covered ""Earth Angel"", Ben Gibbard's schoolboy tenor expressing the song's simple sentiment of affection better than it did the more death-obsessed material on Plans. Perennially overlooked, perennially Shins-compared Rogue Wave refashions Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" with sad, subtle acoustic guitars invoking said comparisons-- better than the James Taylor version, even! Still, Stubbs's Punchbowl is a darkly ironic place (""Drink your fill of the future""). A number of songs nail the kitsch level appropriate given the game's gory, ""retro-futuristic"" setting. Chief among: Cake's understated ""Strangers in the Night"", with shameless schmaltzing, trumpet flourishes and a canned-sounding rhythm section. Flaming Lips could have recorded this delightful, surprisingly faithful ""If I Only Had a Brain"" in their sleep; from the sound of this rendition's cinematic flourishes, weird lucid-dream honks and munchkin giggles, maybe they did. Stubbs's context makes the tune sinister despite Wayne Coyne's ignorant/blissful scarecrowing. Oranger has fun, too, with a crunchier version of ""Mr. Sandman"", bum-bum-bums included. The Raveonettes also did their sexed-up ""My Boyfriend's Back"" for this year's Pretty in Black, which weakens the soundtrack's claims about all-original content while strengthening its lineup. Too bad about the Dandy Warhols' nose-pinched underwater ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"", though. Hey, Punchbowl ain't perfect (dude's snarfing brainstem, remember?) and neither is this soundtrack. Rose Hill Drive's Hendrixed-up, chops-flashing corpse-dragging of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates' Who-popularized ""Shakin' All Over"" is probably the worst offender. Phantom Planet offers up the album's lone new composition, ""The Living Dead"", and it's a sludgy, sneering rocker that sounds like it was commissioned for a video game soundtrack. OK one-liners, though: ""Here's some advice: Don't lose your head."" Plus on ""Lollipop"" you get to hear Ben Kweller do the ooh-lolly-lolly cheek-pop. Almost a reason to live. Again.","Video game soundtrack features new tracks from the Flaming Lips, Death Cab for Cutie, and the Walkmen, among others.

Black Vase / The Warriors,PrurientPrurient & Wolf Eyes,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a7c0084474cd0bfe67/1:1/w_160/e9c47d5d.jpg,2005-11-29 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11808-black-vase-the-warriors/,Load,"The one time I met Dominick Fernow aka Prurient, we were introduced at a Peter Sotos reading. It was the ex-Whitehouse sound collagist and current underground author himself who pointed Fernow out to me. Sotos seemed a fitting facilitator for the handshake, considering the debt Fernow owes Whitehouse for both his high-frequency noisemaking and the linkage he shares with the group via his dark subject matter. For instance, Black Vase is decorated with photos of Fernow's girlfriend posing in S&M; gear, images of foggy/misty landscapes, and the Freudian Buddhist quote, ""Desire is the root of all suffering."" Musically, for those more accustomed to the noise-rock of semi-catchy Lightning Bolt or Negative Approach-style Wolf Eyes, Black Vase will be a tough listen-- unlike those more popular feedback entities, Prurient makes no attempt at establishing even a demolished hook. That said, if there ever were to be a crossover in the harsh noise, power-electronics scene, my money would be on Prurient. Hanging with the likes of Macronympha, Panicsville, Emil Beaulieau, Bloodyminded, Slogun, and Jessica Rylan, the Bushwick-based one-man-band plays his shows shirtless and, unlike many in the subterranean world of contact mics and feed-smack, can actually pull it off. Brandishing microphones, he prostrates himself before his amplifiers, wrestling with sound-waves and noosed cables, more reminiscent of a tar-souled Conor Oberst than an aging Wookie in black sweatpants. Fernow's been at it a while. He started honing his assault in high school in Wisconsin before relocating to Providence, R.I., and then Brooklyn. This is his seventh full-length, or thereabouts, not counting a million splits and cassettes, etc. As in the past, his cocktail includes a heavily processed voice (shouting, growling), electronics, and synthesizer. On Black Vase, there's also tribal factory-cog percussion. Black Vase is front loaded with the 15-minute ""Roman Shower"", a quavering high-pitch flutter. It's not busy or big: Fernow weaves a spare feedback strip that slips into your ear like hemlock. Even when it becomes something scruffier and the piece takes on more strands, Fernow remains focused: The pitch increases, but hardly fuzzes out-- the detailed tones are the whirl of a dental drill. For the final three minutes, he blows more gusts of distortion and then beneath it yowls, ""Two years of garbage/ zig zag to your center/ come back to me."" The noise-zen focus on the longer tracks is admirable, but Fernow's briefer blasts are more sugar-shocked: ""Silent Mary"" is thumping scream-o; ""Sorry Robin"" evokes Throbbing Gristle committing hari-kari; ""Back Cuts"" pairs deep percussion with Fernow's order, ""Face down/ On the floor""; and ""Soft Crack"" ups the pain, sonically and otherwise, with ""Finger nails/ Riding boots/ Jalepeno pepper/ Kitchen floor."" Ouch. Prurient toured with Wolf Eyes in September 2005 and, perhaps in conjunction, Fernow released The Warriors split CD on his own well regarded Hospital Productions. For Wolf Eyes' two long tracks, ""The Terror Tank"" and ""Human Animal"", the Ann Arbor trio doesn't partake in their wicked-witch growls or humid jungle dub centipede dissections. Instead, knobs spin into a grotto and just sorta suffocate. At 17 minutes, ""The Terror Tank"" lurks within a dank cavern. ""Human Animal""'s 11 minutes ream Prurient-style sounds like ring-tone feedback, electrocuted foil, decimated triangles. It's not Wolf Eyes' strongest showing, but it offers a fertile ambient nook. Fernow's material for The Warriors was recorded in Providence in 2002; in the liner notes he recommends playing it loud on an ""overcast afternoon."" I've listened under those conditions, but also at 3 a.m., and it's some of his most piercing. In general, the program's warmer and more collagist than Black Vase-- because the pieces are shorter (check out the booming 43-second burning star core quagmire, ""Rhythm of Shovels""), there are more gradation shifts. The sound: a film shutter exploding. Then there's ""Lime"" tripping like a pack of corralled hell hounds stuck in a vat of lye. ""Ashen Morning Glory""'s another choked cable of boom-hiss ear rot. For a noirish rain-drenched thing, check out the finale, ""Stripped Swimsuit"". This one's high on atmosphere-- the sound of water or, uh, blood on concrete-- with noise slowly sliding in subtly, for only a couple frames, before the song goes away peacefully into the night. Wolf Eyes is a bigger name than Prurient, so folks might run immediately for The Warriors split. That's cool-- it's a solid offering. But as mentioned previously, Prurient spits pure Whitehouse New Britain noise, so if you're tossing off the noise-rock training wheels for the first time, you might want to check out Black Vase, on which the added percussion offers something to latch onto when you're wading in Fernow's wave pool.","Two noise/power-electronics releases from Dominick Fernow, the second of which is a split with Wolf Eyes.

DFA Records Holiday Mix 2005,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8129d034d5c69bf3959/1:1/w_160/1233b5b1.gif,2005-11-29 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2033-dfa-records-holiday-mix-2005/,EMIDFA,"For the sensible types who don't fuck with remixes, the DFA's Holiday Mix 2005 collects, sequences, and beatmatches the better ones that the New York-based label commissioned for three of its primary artists: savant-noise trio the Black Dice, drizzly electro-funker the Juan Maclean, and dancerock flagship act LCD Soundsystem. Later in the mix a krauty soundscape off Black Dice's Broken Ear Record called ""ABA"" and a gorgeous unreleased Delia & Gavin flutter ballad called ""#5"" rep as breather tracks for in-house mixers Tim Goldsworthy and Tim Sweeney, who turn in another typically smooth, effortless blend. People think DJing is easy because of these guys. After that, we could talk about how four otherwise completely different artists sound at peace with one another on this mix-- about the phantom strand of gattaca that keeps them related (though DNA themselves may not be far off here) . But really, Holiday Mix 2005 has less to do with the DFA, more with one small trend this year in dance music: strung-out, space-feeling disco-house and disco-house remixes, the patient, sometimes aimless explorations that dominated 2005's 10 p.m.-12 a.m. stretch. The kickoff means much: Goldsworthy and Luomo each stretch out Black Dice's impossibly compact ""Smiling Off"" like silly putty, the former with harder rockdrum sounds, the latter with trademark slick swaps and swoops. A testament to its density, Juan's ""Give Me Every Little Thing"" appears here in four different incarnations, dubbed and drugged, clubbed and club'd. And in the case of LCD's ""Too Much Love"", remixers Rub 'N' Tug just let the disco-house track lose itself, here granting infinite space to the original's unsettling, claustrophobic vocal harmonies. Stretch everything out like that, though, and the mix pretty much refuses momentum. The 48-minute run moves steady but stays still, if that makes sense. Only at the last seconds do Tim and Tim move into harder stuff: first Tiga and Jesper Dahlback's remix of ""Tribulations"", and finally into Soulwax's acidic take on ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"". That's when the party starts, really-- which makes Holiday something of a perfect, propitious calm.","DFA selectors Tim Sweeney and Tim Goldsworthy mix tracks and remixes from four of the label's primary artists-- LCD Soundsystem, Black Dice, Juan Maclean, and Delia & Gavin.

A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,Panic! At The Disco,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a69d034d5c69bf29e7/1:1/w_160/3be34bad.jpg,2005-11-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6586-a-fever-you-cant-sweat-out/,Fueled by RamenDecaydance,"Ten years ago, who would've guessed that emo would usurp punk as the genre du jour for angst-ridden teens. By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage"", and it's followed by ""London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines"". If those don't quite do it for you, check out ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", or my personal favorite, ""Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"". But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a track or two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings. The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In ""Camisado"", Urie croons, ""You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,"" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In ""Time to Dance"", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, ""When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding"", and ""Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break."" Yeah, you and me both, kid. It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality.","Emo barrel-scrapers make Rites of Spring seem two decades old.

Stay Close,Death Vessel,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcbc0084474cd0c2939/1:1/w_160/d7555e15.jpg,2005-11-28 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2632-stay-close/,North East Indie,"There's an inescapable sideshow quality to the band Death Vessel. Listening to the 10 sepia-toned folk songs on its debut, Stay Close, you can almost hear some carnival barker loudly exhorting midwaygoers to step right up and see THE BOY WHO SINGS WITH THE VOICE OF A GIRL. Inside the tent sit a stage, an old microphone, and an unassuming man named Joel Thibodeau gently plucking an old guitar. None of it would strike anyone as out of the ordinary...until Thidodeau opens his mouth to sing. From that masculine frame emanates a woman's voice, one that doesn't just hit the higher registers like some Appalachian castrati, but possesses an assertive feminine lilt reminiscent of Laura Cantrell or Iris DeMent. But this isn't the typical androgyny of glam, which has no freight in the Americana traditions Death Vessel adopts. Gender isn't an issue inherent in the band's music, but is projected onto it by listeners and passively undiscouraged by the artist himself. Thibodeau-- who plays most of the instruments on the album-- doesn't write from a female perspective-- or from a male perspective either; on Stay Close the point of view is deliberately clouded by the delivery, which adds a layer of mystery to every note. As complex and compelling as it is, this aspect of Death Vessel proves as much a liability as an asset, often suggesting the mere novelty of a physical feat rather than actual artistry. On a few songs-- most notably the jaunty openers ""Mean Streak"" and ""Later in Life Lift""-- Thibodeau's vocal delivery sounds like an end in itself, but more often it serves the purposes of his precisely crafted melodies and obscurely out-of-time lyrics, melding nicely into the mix of acoustic guitars, banjo, fiddle, and organ. From the hand-drawn cover art to the history-bound, occasionally impenetrable lyrics-- ""The load is unneat, sprawling oddly/ J-ing the stern, pelicanly,"" he sings on ""Blowing Cave""-- Stay Close has an antiquated style reminiscent of the 1999 movie Wisconsin Death Trip, which reenacts 19th century news stories about wintry deaths and rural despairs. Occasionally this atmosphere sounds studied and rehearsed, but moments like the coda of ""Nothing Left to Bury"" and the menacing drum-guitar interplay on ""Deep in the Horchata"" suggest a creative investment that transcends put-on airs. A mortal dread, played out with tensely intertwined guitar lines and gusts of feedback, shadows ""Blowing Cave"" and ""Tidy Nervous Breakdown"", making even the capriciousness of upbeat songs like the bluegrass ""Mandan Dink"", about a leisurely day at a place called Picnic Rock, seem precarious. Stay Close hits its stride on the last three songs, starting with his spacious cover of Townes Van Zandt's ""Snow Don't Fall"". On ""Deep in the Horchata"" he scratches out a melody on fiddle to echo his own vocals, as Daneil Mazone's drums stitch everything together. ""White Mole"" ends the album with a nearly instrumental coda, as Thibodeau's soft ooh's usher listeners out of his world and back into the hubbub of the midway.","Singer-songwriter Joel Thibodeau offers delicate, affecting songs sung with a unique feminine lilt.

Sing Along With Acid House Kings,Acid House Kings,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d05e6ef95969320296/1:1/w_160/c47b9c8a.jpg,2005-11-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/490-sing-along-with-acid-house-kings/,Twentyseven,"Acid House Kings' fifth LP isn't menacing, once you get past the absolutely terrifying cover. Do they have Olan Mills in Sweden? Is it haunted? The eyes just follow you. But visions of some wainscoted dystopia where bands wear turtlenecks and play acoustic Kraftwerk medleys are dispelled as ""That's How You Drive Me"" pops in like a pacifier, with all of the comfort and none of the sucking. Its gauzy lilt establishes the album's tone, an effortlessly levitating pastiche of Bacharachian flourishes and precious anorak harmonies, with the faintly lingering musk of something pulled out of mothballs. Major chords are accustomed to shouting, but this is how they sound when they whisper. Bandleader Johan Angergård makes sure the music doesn't get too placid to make an impression by embedding little brain-tattoos into the songs, like the giddy handclaps on ""Do What You Wanna Do"" and hipster-dork fingersnaps on ""This Heart Is a Stone"". This is a sterling example of modern twee with everything in its right place, from the flawless melodies to the droll lyrics: ""They say your middle name is trouble/ But I know it's Caroline."" Comparisons to Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura are both inevitable and unfair, since Acid House Kings predates both. Still, it doesn't help any that the rhythm guitar on ""That's How You Drive Me"" sounds exactly like a fuller version of B&S;'s ""Dog on Wheels"", or that the lead guitar on ""This Heart Is a Stone"" sounds a lot like the one on Camera Obscura's ""Before You Cry"". And how many writers have beaten me to Acid House Kings of Convenience? Whatever; that all this modern naïve-pop sounds the same is part of its appeal, although it's possible that Acid House Kings is a little more calculating than it would appear. Wearing their hearts on the tongues in their cheeks, Acid House Kings presents its achingly earnest songs with such seamless artifice that it approaches performance art. It doesn't stop with the ghastly cover; the first edition of the album comes with a bonus DVD containing three videos and a karaoke version of the album. The karaoke speaks for itself-- realize that you can't sing after all as you watch the band play ping-pong and pull shots of espresso. It's the videos that are of interest. Somewhere between Warhol and ""Laugh-In"", their stark pastels recreate a time that might have sort of existed but probably didn't, when everyone wore cardigans and comb-overs; danced stiltedly to fey pop music; read Marx for pleasure. Post-irony or the new sincerity? Either way, the surface of the presentation (like that of the songs) is smooth as glass-- watching Julia Lannerheim smile beatifically while singing about getting her heart broken on ""7 Days"" (Amy Millan fans: This song owns you), nonchalantly dancing while her bandmates ham it up behind her, is pretty unsettling. But the simplicity of the video imbues her with a sort of iconic presence, like she's every girl who ever danced to a sad song. So what, like, Plato meets the Lucksmiths? The tragic and the adorable vie for attention, which, in this genre, is just par for the course.","Veteran indie pop band takes steps towards justifying the Belle and Sebastian and Camera Obscura comparisons on its fifth album.

One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back,The Darkness,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb565e6ef95969322bb8/1:1/w_160/55aac99e.jpg,2005-11-28 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2525-one-way-ticket-to-helland-back/,Atlantic,"The torment reserved for Justin Hawkins in Hell is obvious. Should the Darkness frontman be so metaphysically unfortunate as to be cast down into the fiery depths, Lucifer would merely have to inundate Hawkins with reviews and articles declaring his band to have been nothing more than a novelty act, a joke, a piss-take. Flames and pitchfork-stabs the singer can handle, but being historically slotted next to Weird Al, Rappin' Rodney, and Ray Stevens would be the ultimate torture. Unfortunately for Hawkins, there's still a very real possibility of him experiencing this Hell on Earth, despite the Darkness' surprising one-year slingshot from obscurity to worldwide fame. Even with millions of albums sold, the cynical legions still question the seriousness of the Darkness' intentions, often confusing the sense of humor apparent in the band's songs and videos with insincerity and winking satire. But all the discussion of falsettos and leotards misses the obvious: If the Darkness were anything less than completely honest devotees of the large-scale rock they're determined to resurrect, their music wouldn't be so successful or so unconditionally welcomed by the Pyromania tour-shirt-wearers that pack their live shows. Thankfully, as the album title and cover image less than subtly suggest, the Darkness haven't forced themselves into an unwilling seriousness to appease the skeptics. But the sound of One Way Ticketto Hell...and Back makes some concessions towards respectability, emphasizing the most critically reputable of their triumvirate of arena-rock influences: Queen, Thin Lizzy, and Def Leppard. By recruiting producer Roy Thomas Baker, the man behind the board on classic Queen albums like Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera, the Darkness set themselves up to both expand their sound and gently remind short-memory critics that pop-metal has roots deeper than the Hair Metal Era. Does it succeed? Well, despite a choir and pan-flute album intro, there's no ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to be found here, so don't get your hopes too high. Baker helps Hawkins slather more strings and horns onto his compositions than on Permission to Land, though none of the songs fully lift off into the kind of gigantic symphonic-rock territory that Queen reached at their peak. In fact, the best use of the full orchestration comes on what might be One Way Ticket's most humble (and best) number, the simple hit-and-run pop song ""Girlfriend"", which adds giddy strings verging on disco to Hawkins' manic falsetto. Elsewhere Baker makes like Michael Kamen in conducting orchestral embellishments to ""Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time"" or ""Blind Man"", but nothing hits the ""November Rain"" epic heights the band so desperately wants to reach. On the other hand, Baker's primary contribution may have been to enable Hawkins' quest to set the world record for most multi-tracked vocals, as One Way Ticket uses the ""magnficio"" effect on nearly every track. When applied sparingly, the Choir Hawkins works well-- the chorus of ""Is It Just Me?"" benefits from the effect's metallic sheen, while it adds bombastic punctuation to lead single ""One Way Ticket"". But in the wrong spots-- paging ""Dinner Lady Arms"" and ""English Country Garden""-- 20 tracks of full-blast falsetto is something less than ear-pleasing, and certainly won't persuade anyone already frightened off by Hawkins' head voice. The majority of the tricks, however, come off as cosmetic distractions, attempts to hide that Hawkins' songwriting hasn't grown since Permission to Land. Many of One Way Ticket's songs have the common second-album curse of being too closely related to siblings from the debut, and tracks that explore new territory come off undercooked (""Hazel Eyes"") or overripe (""Bald""). The material also suffers from a comparative lack of humor; nothing here is so amusing as ""Friday Night"" or ""Growing on Me"", unless you count the no less than three follicle-obsessed tracks present, perhaps a sly reference to their pigeon-holing as hair-metal practitioners. It may benefit the Darkness to cheat over Queen's shoulder even further on these points; after all, A Night at the Opera was famous for having everything from mini-operettas to fey pop minuets to heavy-metal thunderstorms. The band would do well to learn that they don't need to always be cranked up to 11 to convince people of their honest intentions, that they can only ride the non-dynamics of full-on excess so far before their music all starts to blur together into one big sheet of multi-tracked falsetto screech. Otherwise, the band runs the risk of becoming the joke they insist they aren't, honest intentions or no. Beezelbub has a devil set aside for thee, Justin Hawkins.","Pomp-rock band follows its virtually overnight success with a quickly assembled second batch of Queen-aping rock.

Just for a Day / Souvlaki / Pygmalion,Slowdive,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a691ea9e61561daa53cd/1:1/w_160/c16196fa.jpg,2005-11-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11841-just-for-a-day-souvlaki-pygmalion/,Creation,"Swooning, washed-out rock from over a decade ago: Why should these reissues matter? The obvious answer: because this band still sounds incredible. Listening back, it feels like Slowdive were both the first and last word on this particular form of guitar-pop dreaming. It's the same sense you can get from Galaxie 500, Mazzy Star, My Bloody Valentine, or the Cocteau Twins, four bands with whom Slowdive have plenty in common. The 1980s were full of earthy rock from punk's tail end, full of glittery pop and bouncy indie and spandexed anthems-- these people all pitched in to the reverse process of guitar music going slow, slurry, and stylish, going silent-cool, and staring off into space. Loads of acts still work along these woozy, languorous lines, and loads of acts traced the lines out before these turn-of-the-90s groups came along. But each of those artists staked out a patch of territory that feels definitive, a sound complete enough that there's no point following down its path. (Who in the world would think he could squeeze more out of Mazzy Star's tricks than Mazzy Star already did?) No, revisiting these bands is a little like trading in some modern guitar-pop for a Beatles record: The first shot doesn't sound dated, or less sophisticated, and it doesn't necessarily seem ""better,"" or more original, either. It's just a workable, fully-formed thing on its own, which might be why most of the acts that feel like Slowdive today-- say, Ladytron, Lali Puna, Broadcast, or M83-- are coming at that mood and atmosphere from very different directions. A year ago, we were saying roughly the same thing about Catch the Breeze, a Slowdive compilation that was more Portable Summary than Best Of. Two discs, packed with long stretches from the band's three albums and most of the highlights from their singles and EPs-- this was a big enough chunk of their five-year career to make it easy to take a pass on the rest. Now comes the complete follow-through: remastered reissues of all three LPs, in full. The first two, Just for a Day and Souvlaki, come in the now-standard two-disc format, packaged with a lot of the same extras that already wound up on the compilation; the last, 1995's long out-of-print Pygmalion, comes back to life in its original form, which is probably the best and biggest news here. Yeah, yeah: Reissues, duplication, hard-earned money, blah blah blah. But in the long term, all those kids you see picking their noses everywhere will have two solid options for investigating this band-- the short way or the long one. The gist of it: Frontman Neil Halstead has remained the same kind of songwriter throughout his career, from Slowdive's shoegazing to Mojave 3's dreamy ""country"" (someone did try to beat Mazzy Star!) to his solo folk; his songs are warm, uncomplicated, full of some strange weepy longing, and slowed down to a narcotic drawl. What's surprising is how many different ways he's found to present them. The best starting point is 1993's Souvlaki, already a bit of an Essential Slowdive in itself. Across this record, the band kicks up a swirl that matches Halstead's sleepwalking pop perfectly: Guitars stretch and swirl in slow-motion layers, and the vocals seem to be calling desperately out of them, even when they're just lazy chants. This stuff manages to be both pillowy-soft and passionately deep-- shades of the way My Bloody Valentine could blur heaviness into an out-of-focus lull, or the way Galaxie 500's drowsy strum could come out with a fist in the air. A significant chunk of Souvlaki wound up on Catch the Breeze, but anyone hoping the remainder was forgettable is out of luck: Even as collaborator Brian Eno led this album off into a few dub-deep explorations, Halstead's pop songwriting hit a peak, and the album's tracks wound up good-as-""Alison"" almost straight across. (Same goes for the cover of ""Some Velvet Morning"" on the bonus disc-- just Slowdive putting the swirl on someone else's dreamy, narcotic country songwriting.) It's a slightly different scenario for the band's first album, 1991's Just for a Day, which the anthology ignored in favor of the early singles and radio sessions that now stock its bonus disc. Not so surprising: It's a straight line from those singles and EPs to the sound of Souvlaki, whereas Just for a Day is more of a sweet-dream detour. It was in 1991 that the NME said Slowdive could ""make Cocteau Twins resemble Mudhoney,"" and the fluffy sprawl of this record seems to be trying to prove them right. There's a lot less weight to it, and if anything in Slowdive's catalogue will seem dated, it's the overgroomed production on these songs. Still, there's something terrifically oceanic about it-- tracks start out softly floating and then whip themselves up into gorgeous, overbearing squalls. Most important, though, is the reissue of Pygmalion, which should knock down the album's eBay asking price by a good fifty bucks. This is a detour of the best sort, and a Slowdive album in name only: With this record, Halstead pushed the rest of the band to the sidelines, dropped the notion of a ""band"" altogether, and recorded at least two tracks that I can't imagine being rivaled-- ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride. Some of it is all woozy layers: spare touches of guitar, vocal phrases looping and phasing around one another, slow-rolling sampled drums. Some of it takes on the warmth and empty-room minimalism of the ""folk"" Halstead would go on to make. More than just ""some"" of it appears on Catch the Breeze-- five tracks out of nine, from an album that's not exactly consistent. But the sound here is so singular that's much better appreciated in album form, failures and all, and there's good no reason an album this fascinating shouldn't be in print. The fluffy-sweet turn-of-the-90s record: That one is fans-only. The pop-rock record with the influential swoon: Anyone whose rock tastes run to the ""dreamy"" needs it, or at least needs ""Alison"" popping up on the mp3-player shuffle. The post-rock obscurity that's worth $12 just for ""Blue Skied an' Clear"": You won't find anything else quite like it. Swooning, washed-out rock from the 90s-- why should these reissues matter? I keep listening for reasons they wouldn't sound as good as they did a decade ago, and on at least two of these records, I'm not finding any at all.","Sanctuary reissues all three studio albums from the influential UK shoegazers.

Amber Headlights,Greg Dulli,by: Stephen M.

What if, instead of ditching these songs following the death of a close friend, Greg Dulli had finished Amber Headlights and released it on schedule, sometime in 2002? Would it sound any different than it does three years and two Twilight Singers albums later? Better or worse? More vital or less? Does hearing the Twilight Singers' 2003 album Blackberry Belle first change the way Amber Headlights sounds now? The likelihood is that this album would have sounded just as disappointing in 2002 as it does in 2005. Amber Headlights is a step backwards after the lush beats and subdued songs of the Twilight Singers' debut, 2000's Twilight, but it also seems weak following the harrowing Blackberry Belle and even the so-so covers album She Loves You. The fact that it was released out of order only reinforces comparisons to the albums that would have preceded and followed Amber Headlights, forcing the listener to create an alternate timeline based on so many what-ifs. The album starts with the nearly identical ""So Tight"" and ""Cigarettes"", both of which sport conspiratorial verses that peel out into racing choruses. But any momentum is tripped up by lyrics that border on parody: ""Sexy lady, she wanna play me,"" Dulli sings on ""So Tight"", ""after she get hot she starts to get a little shady."" They're the best tracks on Amber Headlights, but we've heard better versions of essentially the same songs on Blackberry Belle-- ""Teenage Wristband"" and ""Decatur Street"" are not only more pointed and purposeful, but their momentum proves more reckless. From there it's downhill. ""Domani"" recalls 1965, particularly ""The Slide Song"", but its swelling chorus suffers from the lyrics' forced ambiguity, which predictably compound love and drugs: ""I'm never coming down/so beautiful/no one around."" Songs like ""Early Today (and Later Tonight)"" handle romance with the rough disregard of a trashy revenge flick: all exploitation, no soul. The obvious pun of the album title doesn't help-- Amber Headlights = boobs! The drama that infuses Dulli's best work quickly descends to melodrama: ""I used to love you/ now I'm going to hurt you,"" he sings on ""Early Today (and Later Tonight)"". ""When We Two Parted"" it ain't. The other downside to these necessary comparisons with Dulli's previous and subsequent work is that they reveal how limited his particular aesthetic can be. He's made a fairly solid and respectable 20-year career out of very strictly defined creative parameters, drawing on specific strains of black American music-- 1960s and 70s soul in particular-- to bolster his white rock sensibility. His best songs are swirls of dark desire, pitting Dulli against his demons; at his best and darkest, it feels like the most he can even hope for is just to keep them at bay. Amber Headlights, on the other hand, sounds bloodless in comparison: his most dangerous demons seem to be nicotine and the persistent urge to remind us he's got some great blow. He doesn't just revel in his dark persona; he happily confesses his seedy sins as if every listener were a priest. But there's no real danger in these songs, no conflict, no stakes at all-- so no payoff, no catharsis. No wonder Dulli abandoned them.","The former Afghan Whig finally releases this collection of tracks that he abandoned after the 2002 death of close friend and film director Ted Demme.

As much as they've become cultural touchstones, these two things hardly epitomize the man's career or indicate the length of the shadow he cast on r&b.; Here was a guy who cut a few obscure sides and then spent the next five years of his career as a session musician and songwriter for Stax Records, plying his craft in the service of others, and who also turned out to be a ridiculously charismatic performer in his own right. His booming baritone and sweeping Spector-squared arrangements set the tone for a whole generation of r&b; in the 1960s, while his 70s Blaxploitation soundtracks largely defined the genre with their chicken-scratch wah guitars, stabbing strings, and tough vocals. And of course he had his monologues-- long, sometimes rambling speeches that he unapologetically used to preface the meat of many of his songs. Can You Dig It? packs two discs wall-to-wall with 32 of the best tracks Hayes recorded under his own name, understandably leaving out the significant portion of his career he spent laboring for Stax, though you could certainly focus an interesting compilation on his early work backing and writing for other performers-- the guy co-wrote ""Soul Man"", after all. The whole extravaganza kicks off with that familiar twittering hi-hat, joined by one of the coolest rhythm guitar parts ever, and...is it possible not to like the ""Theme From Shaft""? It gets something of a novelty rap, mostly as a result of innumerable terrible karaoke performances, but this is a truly badass piece of music, heinous funk rhythms and an entire symphony orchestra all building to a casually awesome drum fill that drops you into that ultra-smooth sing-rap. ""Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?"" Hayes was talking about the Richard Roundtree character, but much of it applies to himself as well. A Google image search for the man reveals a gallery of way-too-cool shots of Hayes with his shaved head, perpetual sunglasses and shirtless displays of gold body hardware, but Hayes did more than his share to live up to that image in his music. The cross-section of that music captured in this tracklisting is about as good as it gets. Highlights from Hayes' other soundtrack work-- his theme from Tough Guys is sweet 'n' nasty proto-disco with a synth bass part from another planet-- mingle with album cuts, minor hits, and a few edits of his longest tracks, including a seven-minute reduction of his epic reading of Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"". Thankfully, the compilers have left intact the entire 12 minutes of his definitive take on Bacharach/David's ""Walk on By"", a psychedelic funk odyssey filled with scorching fuzz guitar solos and grandiose string arrangements that's as close to perfect as any song of that length could be. It's hard for anything to top ""Walk on By"", but Hayes hardly needs to worry about that when his second tier includes songs like ""Do Your Thing"", an essential slab of languid bongo funk, the throbbing, horn-soaked instrumental ""Disco Connection"", and ""Hyperbolicsyllabic-sesquadelymistic"", a nine-minute funk crawl capped by an out-of-this world piano solo that Public Enemy later snipped a portion of for the basis of ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"". ""Joy, pt. 1"" went a long way toward establishing him as a master of seductive r&b;, wrapping direct sexuality in a pillowy love song packed with flutes, strings and horns. It's actually a little jarring sitting next to the plaintive live version of the traditional gospel song ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" There are only a few places in the two-plus hours of music here where not everything works. ""For the Good Times"" is a little too smooth, while the five-minute monologue that opens ""I Stand Accused"" is practically self-parody, and boring to boot. The need to edit down a few of the longer tracks is unfortunate, but understandable (if anything they could have lopped the intro of ""I Stand Accused""), and anyone who wants the full-length versions of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" or ""Do Your Thing"" can simply scoop up Hot-Buttered Soul or the Shaft soundtrack-- you'll want to own them anyway. Regardless, this is a phenomenal introduction to a man whose career was positively elemental both to 70s r&b; and funk and to the development of the album as a forum for stretching out and experimenting.","Sadly mostly known for one song and his ""South Park"" role, the r&b; great's rewarding solo career is here compiled on a 2xCD, 32-track collection.

FabricLive 24,Diplo,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb895e6ef95969322c30/1:1/w_160/8cc8bf60.jpg,2005-11-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2572-fabriclive-24/,Fabric,"When the first Hollertronix mix CD Never Scared first made the rounds in 2003, two kids from Philadelphia proved they achieve what electroclash and dancepunk had aimed for but never quite managed: they revolutionized club culture by ignoring the blueprint and starting anew. Their mixes piled R. Kelly, the Clash, Cash Money Millionaires, and Baltimore club atop each other with no regard for smooth transitions, genre boundaries, or copyright law. DJs Diplo and Low Budget used roughly 200 tracks on the mix-- the result was a deliriously anarchic mess. Two years later, Diplo is no longer an outsider. He and M.I.A. are on some new-millennium power-couple shit, he's turned baile funk into a hipster cause celebre, and he's worked with guys like Vybz Kartel and Kano. More importantly, you can go out any night of the week in New York and hear DJs mix Southern gutter-rap into new-romantic synthpop. Diplo often gets dissed as a carpet-bagging dilettante, but he's ultimately made clubland safe for carpet-bagging dilettantes like, um, me. So it's appropriate that the London club Fabric would invite Diplo to contribute to its Fabriclive mix series. What compelled Diplo to turn in his most obvious, placid mix yet is another matter. FabricLive 24 features plenty of amazing music and finds some inspired connections, but the great thing about Diplo has always been his ecstatic embrace of chaos, and we don't get a whole lot of that here. What we do get is the less-talked-about side of Diplo, the guy who racks up clothing-label sponsorships like notches on his belt. There's not much heavy, dirty shit on FabricLive 24; Diplo instead focuses on frisky, glinty electro. He sticks hard to genres that fit this side of his aesthetic (new wave, baile funk, classic house) while mostly tossing out the bits that don't (rap, Baltimore club). Copyright law probably has a lot to do with this; it's Diplo's first commercially available mix, and he certainly can't afford to jam in tracks the way he does on his underground sets. Additionally, he's going for a European audience here, more schooled in rave than rap, and it shows; he's gotten it into his head that a DJ set should tell a story rather than just build momentum. Problem is, he doesn't seem to have a story to tell. The first third of the mix is dominated by a long, unbroken set of 80s electropop tracks (Cybotron, Yazoo, Debbie Deb) which, while uniformly great, are so thematically close to each other that they grow monotonous. When he segues into harder, raunchier stuff (Cajmere's acid-house classic ""Percolator"", Ludacris' bounce-twerk classic ""What's Your Fantasy?""), he does it by way of watery click-house tracks like Solid Groove's ""This Is Sick"". Later, a baile funk mini-set builds up intensity nicely for the snarl-grime energy-bomb of Jammer's ""Destruction VIP"", only to deaden its own momentum with the Cure's undanceable ""Lovesong"". And it would've been a great idea to end a dance mix with a mopey, meditative Cat Power jam if Tim Sweeney hadn't already done the exact same thing a year ago. At its worst, Fabriclive 24 is a haphazard and repetitive mix of a bunch of great tracks-- which is still not a bad thing. But it also gives us one tantalizing glimpse of what it could be when Diplo mixes Outkast's ""B.O.B."" into Le Tigre's ""Deceptacon"": two frantic, desperate, furious dancefloor anthems right on top of each other, both songs feeding on each other and finding a sense of ecstatic liberation. My jaw dropped when he pulled off the same transition at Intonation, and it nearly did again here. If this one moment of beautiful insanity overshadows the rest of Diplo's fun, competent mix CD, maybe that should tell him he needs to be doing fewer fun, competent mix CDs and making more moments like that happen.","First officially released mix from the Hollertronix DJ-- likely hamstrung by copyright issues-- offers only a partial picture of the selector's sets.

Oh You're So Silent Jens,Jens Lekman,by: Amy Phillips,Managing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd213d197565213b61d/1:1/w_160/8d6a3bb9.jpg,2005-11-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4970-oh-youre-so-silent-jens/,Secretly Canadian,"Jens Lekman does not have a girlfriend. This seems to be an injustice on par with the Sony rootkit fiasco and the cancellation of ""Arrested Development"". Lekman is charming. He writes orchestral pop songs that swoon like silent movie damsels in distress. He rhymes ""chili"" with ""chilly."" The Swedish singer/songwriter hasn't been in a relationship for four years. Blaming the music business for his non-existent love life, he recently threatened to quit releasing records to become a telemarketer. Somebody hook this guy up with Nerve Personals quick-- we need to keep him around. Oh You're So Silent Jens, his new collection of previously released singles and B-sides, is a marvel of pure songcraft. Clichés unravel, traditional structures break down and build back up again, unpretentious witticisms sparkle. And then there are the sonics of the thing: lo-fi Phil Spector room dividers of sound, unexpected samples, and Lekman's rich, cavernous monotone. Lekman is often compared to Stephin Merritt (deadpan delivery, debt to Tin Pan Alley), Morrissey (melodrama, dry humor), Jonathan Richman (naiveté, simple language), and Belle and Sebastian (flowery arrangements, twee sensibility). All of these comparisons are dead on, and Lekman is worthy of the kind of slobbering devotion slathered on these artists. Granted, his 2004 debut album, When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog, was a tentative first step, relying too heavily on unadulterated cheese-- but Oh You're So Silent Jens is cheese, chocolate, strawberries, and something tangy to wash it down with. Take ""Maple Leaves"", two versions of which bookend the disc. An exploration of the difficulties of communication between men and women, it glides on pillowy strings, tearjerker harp flourishes, stately tympani, girl-group backing oohs, and celebratory wedding bells. He gets away with groan-worthy lines like, ""If you don't take my hand/ I'll lose my mind completely/ Madness will finally defeat me,"" not just on the strength of a strong melody and keen production sense, but by following it with one of the album's great signature lyrical twists: ""She said it was all make believe/ But I thought she said maple leaves."" Lekman winks through his tears. ""And when she talked about a fall/ I thought she talked about Mark E. Smith."" A diligent student of American and UK indie pop, Lekman knows exactly where he fits in the world-historical timeline, and he splatters his influences all over his songs. ""Maple Leaves"" borrows from the lush source material for the Avalanches' ""Since I Left You"". The fantastic ""Black Cab"" wallows luxuriously in loneliness (""You don't know anything/ So don't ask me any questions/ Just turn the music up/ And keep your mouth shut"") and samples both Belle and Sebastian and the Left Banke. On ""F-word"", Lekman ties a piece of Arab Strap's ""Kate Moss"" to stray cats pleading outside his Gothenburg window. ""Pocketful of Money"" is a spare symphony of finger snaps, pithy piano and bass melodies, and Lekman's pledge to spend a month's salary on a girl he just met who turns his legs to spaghetti-- but then Calvin Johnson's deeply intoned ""I'll come running with a heart on fire,"" snagged from Beat Happening's ""Gravedigger Blues"", crashes in unexpectedly. This off-key intrusion has the potential to be a deal-breaker, but Lekman instead turns it into a lovely counterpoint to his own soaring echo of the phrase. Like all love affairs, Oh You're So Silent Jens isn't perfect. The tracks from last year's Rocky Dennis concept EP are a mushy mess, and the plodding, doleful solo piano ballad ""Sky Phenomenon"" is only saved by two brilliant lines: ""At this time of year/ It's like someone spilled a beer/ All over the atmosphere,"" and, ""But I would not be accepted/ 'Cause I can't dance the funky chicken."" Lekman's faithful cover of Television Personalities' ""Someone to Share My Life With"" (""that someone could be you"") is the kind of thing that makes women roll their eyes and hop onto the back of a motorcycle driven by Tommy Lee. Which brings us back to the true source of Lekman's girl problems. It isn't the industry's fault that he can't find true love-- if anything, the kind of exposure his music has brought should be more effective than the best personal ad. But then, maybe his lack of a girlfriend isn't such a tragedy. As much as us ladies might fantasize about being saviors to wounded butterflies like Lekman, the reality of actually sharing a life with a guy whose desperation is so public is fairly unappealing. Who really wants a song like ""Julie"" (appearing here in jubilant, hollow-drummed remix form) written about her, even if it contains the couplet, ""Oh Julie, meet me by the vending machine/ Oh Julie, I'm gonna buy you a wedding ring""? And does Lekman truly desire a nice, boring, healthy relationship? If he found The One and lived happily ever after, he wouldn't have anything to write about. ","Swedish songwriter proves himself one of the year's most promising new talents with an indie pop concoction that owes as much to the Avalanches and Phil Spector as to Morrissey and Magnetic Fields.

The Antidote,Morcheeba,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e6c0084474cd0bff0e/1:1/w_160/ecfed1b1.jpg,2005-11-27 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5427-the-antidote/,Echo,"During the Black Plague ""physicians"" thought pigeons placed above a patient's head would somehow suck the illness out. They also bled people. However, neither of those nostrums tops the absurdity of Morcheeba dubbing their first sans-Skye Edwards album as The Antidote. After a string of increasingly flawed LPs, the enticing siren Edwards bolted, leaving the schlubby Godfrey brothers in the dust with their mediocre backing music. So how do Paul and Ross replace one of the sexiest voices of the past 10 years? They throw in former Noonday Underground singer Daisy Martey; an Angela Lansbury replacing a Marilyn Monroe. Not to start a fight, but Edwards possessed a soulful purr that wooed the staunchest critics into penning bizarrely detailed sex fantasy reviews. Martey is a hammed-up Natalie Merchant. Even worse, the Godfreys curb their toasted Internet Caf electronica for tuckered-out 1960s and 70s nostalgia. We all threw tomatoes when 2002's Charango killed our high, but now even that poorly rolled joint delivers the far-out vibes that the painfully sober Antidote lacks. Opener ""Wonders Never Cease"" doubly offends with its seemingly self-important title and hokey Edie Brickell artsiness. ""Ten Men"" only continues the bohemian posturing, meshing Renaissance Faire guitar lines with a slack-jawed alt-country tempo. I mean, the whole thing has the professionalism of Michelle Branch. Don't fret though faithful ""trigger hippies,"" you'll still get your psych, only now it's watered down, attached to the beginning of tracks as curt snippets of yesteryear. Hear that sitar? Of course you don't, it stopped playing when the hunky tonk guitars came in. Try as you might, searching for vestiges of the ol' Morcheeba is futile. Press releases try to plug this album as some freewheeling journey back in time, peppered with sharp-toothed blues and bouncy Bacharach melodies. Fat chance-- Martey's got neither the bite nor brio for such deft reincarnation. Sadly, this is your mama's Morcheeba, totally sanitized and sexless, even when supposedly tapping the era of drugs, rebellion, and free love. They could've at least changed the band's name, for legacy's sake. Somewhere, Skye Edwards must feel as if she was just ejected from a burning plane.","UK trip-hop chancers attempt their first record without former vocalist Skye Edwards.

Throw Down Your Arms,Sinéad O'Connor,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a19d034d5c69bf5280/1:1/w_160/ce2ebc27.gif,2005-11-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5945-throw-down-your-arms/,Rocket Science,"Okay, let's be up front: Your appreciation of this album will be directly tied to how seriously you can take the idea of Sinead O'Connor singing reggae. No one debates that O'Connor can sing. Nellie Hooper's barely-there backing of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" throws her quivering, gorgeous voice right up in your ear. Also, no one should doubt her love of this music; don't forget that when she pulled the crazy pope-ripping stunt on Saturday Night Live it was to the tune of Bob Marley's ""War"". And reggae, the most non-secularized pop music on the planet, often chapter-and-verse on record, is an apt vehicle for a woman who left music in order to become an ordained priest in a non-traditional Catholic denomination. And Throw Down Your Arms is certainly authentic. It was recorded at the Marley's Tuff Gong studios in Kingston, and produced by Sly & Robbie, one of the five or 10 most smoking rhythms sections ever, in or out of reggae. And here's the thing you're probably most worried about: no, she doesn't sing it in cod-patois. Her voice is the same as always, that ringing, lilting Irish clarity. So thank God (or Jah) for small favors and good taste. Anyway, it's hard to fuck up a song like Peter Tosh's ""Downpressor Man"", and O'Connor doesn't. The band gets deep in the pocket, bass and drums on equal footing with voice as with actual reggae, and O'Connor sticks mostly to fire and brimstone roots like Burning Spear's ""Door Peep"" and the hectoring anthropomorphism of Lee Perry's ""Vampire"". She stretches out on Perry's charming ""Curly Locks"", made famous by Junior Byles, a sweet tale of a dreadlocks in love with a girl whose father will let her having nothing to do with him. At the end of the day, though, I'm a bit puzzled over why the world needed an album of Sinead O'Connor reggae covers. If anything she's too reverential and deferential. Nothing here betters the originals, and nothing takes them out into new, unexplored terrain. There's no way O'Connor can match the dread of Burning Spear's original ""Marcus Garvey"", to say nothing of the fact that music here never stretches its legs out to the wobbly dub versioning of ""Garvey's Ghost"". (Seriously, if you don't own the Marcus Garvey album, run to the record store yesterday.) The world of reggae is so vast, with so many great records to explore, that unless you're a huge Sinead O'Connor fan, this isn't much more than an enjoyable curio.","Irish singer records an album of reggae covers with help from legendary producers/rhythm section Sly & Robbie.

Gimme Trouble,ADULT.,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a014c0084474cd0bfa96/1:1/w_160/d3c9cc21.gif,2005-11-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/58-gimme-trouble/,Thrill Jockey,"A funny thing happened the last time I saw Adult. Someone in the crowd requested their 2001 electro favorite ""Hand to Phone"", which wasn't so strange. Nicola Kuperus said she was sick to death of singing that song, which wasn't so unusual either. But then-- then she did start singing it, in an eye-rolling parody of her old robot monotone: hand to phone, hand to phone, blah blah blah. I can't think of much better shorthand for the group's career arc-- abandoning those pitch-perfect light-speed electronics and diving off into a world of potentially embarrassing basement trainwrecks. Kuperus traded icy drone for the kind of witchy yelping not much heard since Bauhaus's prime. Adam Lee Miller traded clean-line synth flash for nasty bass-guitar buzz. They added a guitar player; they spazzed out. And as much as each new release came out like a total mess, there was something in each of them that's totally fascinating, as if each of those risky sounds-- from cyborg post-punk to cheerleader pogo goth-- was one wobbly, perilous step in the direction of something much greater. The only question: when-- or whether-- they'd ever break past the wobbles and come out with whatever that great thing was. Is that thing Gimme Trouble? Not quite-- but this is a whole lot closer than anything we've heard so far. For one thing, there's the sound, which has perked up beautifully. Drum machine pump, bass blurt, synth clatter, guitar screech-- they all mesh clean and shiny here, and on some tracks they take on a slanty, minimalist bounce that practically breaks a smile. ""Bad Idea"" kicks off sounding like early Devo, something from an era where weirdoid punk and synthesizers got along naturally. The go-go drum machine and one-note guitar on ""Still Waiting"" leave the whole thing feeling vaguely like an early B-52's rave-up. Half the rest sounds like X-Ray Spex or Siouxsie and the Banshees-- there is vintage new wave rawness and goth-inflected bounce all over this thing, and it manages to leave this band in fresh-sounding territory that's somehow miles away from most everything today's ""new wave revivalists"" and/or ""electro-punks"" have even thought about trying. Best of all: no mess. No little time-trials, or side-notes, or half-formed clatters-- just 12 songs that, while somewhat lacking in super-blazing stand-outs, present a giant step up in coherence. That's good news: It doesn't feel so ""confrontational"" anymore, does it? With their last full-length, Anxiety Always, it sounded like they were challenging us, deliberately nag-nag-nagging us with the shriekiest, most paranoid rumble they could muster. That was fun, in its way, and it's certainly not as if they've dropped that agenda. But the Adult. on this record can be ""fun"" in a much more pleasant, straightforward way-- the same jump-around-and-screech-along way their early electro singles could be. The only thing that still worries me is the memory of them on stage, with Kuperus posing and sneering and genuinely trying to act out the cretinous-vampire schtick the band's been working its way through. Are we going to have to get Devo and Fred Schneider to come wave the landing lights and guide them to the sweet spot? This isn't scary tough-guy muscle, guys-- it's spazzed-out pogo geek-punk, and it's almost nearly there. Cover ""Rock Lobster"" if you have to.","On this Thrill Jockey LP, the Detroit duo continue their transformation from cyborg post-punk to cheerleader pogo goth.

"Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding the Roots, Vols. 1 & 2",The Roots,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2abb1335d7bf1698542/1:1/w_160/8a9be328.gif,2005-11-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6835-home-grown-the-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-roots-vols-1-2/,Geffen,"There's not much to understand, really. The only song you really need-- and, blasphemy!, you're getting this out a Philly cat-- is ""Push Up Ya Lighter"", from 1996's Illadelph Halflife. The Roots band never came closer to that tight-wound, RZA-squared minimalism, and they did it there without compromising their looser jazz/soul/funk sensibilities (check the watery, monkish keyb progression). The Roots worked a few years behind New York's producers in the beginning, but when records like ""Clones"" or ""Concierto of the Desperado"" hit, they made comparable Alc and RZA tracks sound demo. Allmusic loves dropping the Stetsasonic bomb when time comes to squash the ridiculously common ""Roots are the first hip-hop band"" belief among those who first saw the Roots at their college SpringFest (same kids on facebook who like ""hip-hop for dancing."") But that doesn't mean live instruments lost their cachet, especially for ingratiating 1990s hip-hop to rockies and jazzbos. Remember, too, that the Roots put Jay-Z in that Unplugged game, and I don't think anybody has taken the time to mine that moment for its music-cultural relevance. And yet as much as they shine musically, Roots MCs Black Thought and to a much lesser extent Malik B struggle with the pen. ""Lighter"" covers all the topics and touchstones: coming to terms with modern hip-hop's rags-or-riches come-up; repping Philly; repping hip-hop's Blackness; loving ladies right. Vaguely conscious, literary insofar as he was a tad sophistic, Black Thought spouts truisms in deft internal rhyme schemes, but after a decade dude still doesn't have a single memorable line, and that's foul. The better Roots mic moments have always been on the guest spots, and lady Bahamadia's work here (""Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks/ Shit is real like E packs"") recalls past upstagings from Common, Dice Raw, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Cody ChestnuTT, Q-Tip, usw. Pride's a bitch, though. Had this band thought of themselves as producers and made records with different rappers rather than convince themselves of some personal unfuckwithable aesthetic, they could have killed. Home Grown! should kill me on nostalgia alone, but all I can think of is how the Roots refused to back Jay-Z at Live 8, some snub factor or another, and how in retrospect the only reason I liked them was because they're a band, and at 13 that made it the only rap music I could play in my parents' rap-is-not-music cars. (Hey, that's how Beth and Barry roll.) Otherwise, sorry, the Roots never mustered much consequence-- musically speaking, this is a completely insular career of mostly great beats and half-realized rhymes. They have a loyal following the same way Dave Matthews or Pat McGee or moe. have them, and surely their loyal fans picked up all the rarities and unreleased these and those along the way-- maybe even off that triple-disc bootleg that was on the shelves for a minute this time last year. The rest of you might like to know that the band remixed ""Don't Say Nuthin'"", last year's worst rap single by a kilo, which I take as tacit admission they thought the same. The dub take on neo-dull song ""Break You Off"" ain't bad, and the live medley of ""The Seed/Melting Pot/The Web"" has this nasty snare-on-quarters backbeat for ""Seed"" that's worth talking about. Still, I don't know why Geffen split this into two separate volumes except for the obvious $$$ reasons, and I don't know why, after culling pretty evenly from their studio LPs, the Roots left off ""Push Up Ya Lighter"". Criminy. Maybe then I would have read the liners.","Philly hip-hop group issues two volumes of historical material.

Beyond awful. Listen, I know a lot of people out these parts didn't dig DFA79's mini-metalisms on You're A Woman, I'm A Machine-- too hard, too soft, too boring, not boring enough, vaguely misogynistic, etc. You wrote these things to me and I have all your emails in a file somewhere. But understand a simple, if not mathematical fact about this two-piece bass-and-drum duo: By necessity their songs have little to them. They're efficient bursts of less-is-more rock that ride riffs hard then cut out right before they stale. I'd have thought at least one motherfucker tapped for this turkey-shot remix project would have figured that out. Instead we get Justice on some reverso Advantage shit, making ""Blood on Your Hands"" sound like the theme to Super Pitfall, and that game's the fucking worst. Hey, let's talk Bloc Party's Silent Alarm Remixed, from which we might pretend Romance Bloody Romance took some Ps and Qs. SAR, remember, featured a different producer doing up a different track from the Bloc's debut. Then it came sequenced just like Silent Alarm, and a few of us (me) actually liked it better than the original LP-- more variety, less helicopters, etc. SAR at least made sense, since every Bloc track physically had a bunch of possible reconfigurations. Romance, meanwhile, has four telling remixes of ""Black History Month"" (the band's worst song), three of ""Romantic Rights"", an OK new song and a cover of former Peel favorite La Peste's ""Better Off Dead"". Inexplicably, nobody behind the papers realized after the second or third dude asked to remix ""Black History Month"" that maybe, maybe, DFA79's songs aren't suited for the full-on remix treatment-- they don't need it either. Listen, I respect the renewed interest in tripping up rock-kid disco homophobia (still rampant) with these Phoned-in remix blitzes of late. Vice Records, seems, is fighting the good fight. But the Braxe/Falke and Dählback joints here are so flimsy, that vocoder'd out Makuziak futuro-disco bullshit so obnoxiously tongue-in-cheek, I can't imagine anybody really psyched to hit up his neighb Fixed or Making Time party to try out his new Diesel hightops on the dancefloor. Final Fantasy's string arrangements for ""Black History"" have their charm, sure, but only Trash's Erol Alkan turns in the album's non-bomb, a simple edit of ""Romantic Rights"" that overlays percussion tracks for an intro and flips the vocal track a disorienting half-step early. Which is saying something: If the game is to make rock tracks playable in clubs, why fuck with them more than you have to?

A Hole Is True / Savage Summer Sun,Double Leopards,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4a13d197565213b061/1:1/w_160/cce30357.jpg,2005-11-22 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11722-a-hole-is-true-savage-summer-sun/,Troubleman Unlimited,"There's always been something primitive and pre-rational within the garbled drones of Brooklyn-based quartet Double Leopards. If more metallic drone sculptors like Earth or Sunn O))) can approximate the sound of a continent's tectonic plates shifting into position, Double Leopards instead channel a later epoch when the earliest creatures first began to extend their curious feelers out of the primordial ooze. And as the Leopards have accelerated their prolific output, it has grown progressively more difficult to identify the constituent parts of their mercurial noise. Since the release of their landmark 2003 2xLP Halve Maen, Double Leopards have seemingly foresworn the epic statement, choosing instead to salt their music away on numerous smaller releases. The best of their recent crop might be Out of One, Through One and to One, a vinyl-only album released earlier this year on Eclipse. But measuring the group's many recordings against each other is ultimately fruitless. Each variant is similar but displays subtly distinct gradations of modulated, indecipherable noise, and when considered together as a body of work they join to create an interconnected terrain of daunting post-industrial badlands. Recorded, appropriately enough, at the Tar Pit in Brooklyn, A Hole Is True is likely to be the group's easiest-to-find release to date, and is perhaps the most succinct distillation of their shadowy, merciless arts. The title seems a slight misdirection, as there's no sign of holes anywhere on the album's three impossibly dense squalls. Whatever its substance, the opening ""Inmost Light"" enters with a dizzying electric whirr that repeatedly threatens to congeal into a riff, before getting blown to pieces by a cyclone of unmoored spectral wails. ""Chemical Wedding"" is even simpler, just a razor-thin current of pulsing overtones, while the 21-minute ""White Cadillacs"" uses voices nearly recognizable as human to deliver shifty messages directly to the reptilian core of your brainstem. Intense as A Hole Is True can be, even more abusive is Savage Summer Sun, which captures two live performances recorded during the group's 2005 tour. The first of these, recorded at Il Coral in Los Angeles, is a 36-minute torrent of malformed rhythms and hypnotic sheets of distended feedback; the second is an equally lengthy sequence of blistering, slow-motion amp mulch and decaying radio waves. Although not quite on the grand scale of Halve Maen, these tracks are purely wide-screen experiences, and sitting through them both back-to-back can be an utterly devastating procedure. As with all of Double Leopard's most potent rituals, these two albums can each induce a cognitive return to those familiar black waters, allowing the listener to settle back into the murk and patiently await the further cooling of the Earth's crust.","

Be Careful What You Call Home,Paul Duncan,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc7c0084474cd0c2932/1:1/w_160/e6c68ffb.jpg,2005-11-21 06:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2629-be-careful-what-you-call-home/,Hometapes,"""In a time of wordy music/ Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba"" Lyric of the month, easily. And Paul Duncan is true to his word, keeping the yakking to a minimum throughout Be Careful What You Call Home, instead allowing his voice to mingle with the other instruments as just another useful wave-form. In fact, this album is so subtle that the first time you listen to it, it barely registers, like a ghost whisper or a beige amongst browns. But it leaves you with a pleasant sensation and sucks you back for more spins, and by the third or fourth time through, it's difficult not to be hooked on its blend of pastoral beauty and electronic abstraction. As the album develops its gently experimental approach, Jim O'Rourke and Fridge spring to mind as good comparison points, and like them Duncan's drum sound warrants its own little mention as a thing of rare beauty. The rest of the sonic palette is comprised of Rhodes, bass, glockenspiel, strings, and other soft things that sound great put up against the boom of the drums, which Duncan chops into new shapes as he sees fit. Duncan's voice is a soft and tuneful tenor that slides into that texture as if on a river of Vaseline. ""Oil in the Fields"" is the best distillation of the album's overall aesthetic, riding a thumping kick drum, brushed cymbals and pretty Rhodes chords, synth counter-melodies tumbling like snow behind Duncan's impressionistic verses. ""I remember father's ring/ Remember mother's hair/ Don't remember the color of her eyes/ Until I look at mine"" he sings, and the song follows a free-form structure from there, breathy vocal harmonies rising in the middle and glockenspiel leading the walk to the end. In a time of hyperactive music, quiet beauty like this is a welcome chance to calm the caffeinated nerves. If Be Careful What You Call Home is uniform, it's uniform in the right way, wringing a satisfying listen out of a simple premise.","Jim O'Rourke and Fridge are comparison points for this gently experimental artist.

Love Songs of the Hanging Gardens,Kelley Polar,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a5ea9e61561daa4855/1:1/w_160/3313aa3c.jpg,2005-11-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6585-love-songs-of-the-hanging-gardens/,Environ,"Poor Kelley Polar has one hell of an overdetermined bio: classical training at Juilliard, arrangement work for Metro Area (whose label, Environ, put out Polar's debut album), and of course that damned cello, which will forever have the name ""Arthur Russell"" rustling off lazy reviewers' lips. But wait, it gets better: his older sister is none other than Blevin Blectum, formerly of the incendiary scatolotronica duo Blectum from Blechdom. ""It's true,"" confirms Blectum. ""We grew up together in rural environments playing with Legos and listening to Star Wars disco records."" Ok, so that's where the disco comes from, not to mention the snap-tight arrangements. Polar's biggest hurdle, though, is disco: doubly so since he juices up his arrangements with tasteful strings-- they're nothing like Russell's rumbling, one-line arguments, but neither are they Philly's cheesy sweeps-- trebly so since disco's hipster ascendancy in the past half-decade. But it would be a shame to write this off as disco nouveau, or whatever damning with faint categories we'd like to pull off. If you listen with your Italo goggles off, you'll hear uncanny references to Matias Aguayo's recent Kompakt album, for instance-- the refrain ""I can't wait 'til you're back here in the dark,"" from ""Tyurangalila"", could easily be one of Aguayo's do-ya-think-I'm-sexy-because-I'm-not-sure mantras-- while the hooks jutting through every song's cheek and jowl are as pop as Annie or Mylo. Which is to say that Love Songs of the Hanging Gardens is yet another surprising, ambitious release whose primary intent is the pursuit of songform, all other genre trappings aside. There's no denying, of course, the very Environ-ness of the album (in part because Polar's string arrangements for Metro Area helped cement the sound), from the sparseness of the compositions-- every sound seems to exist in its own bubble, with soapy friction foaming up when they collide-- to the analog drum machines and bass lines. But other details, from rhythm sounds to spry arpeggios to vocal tics, nod variously to Alter Ego, schaffel, and Erlend Oye's fey delivery. But none of this speaks to the wholeness of Love Songs, which arises in part from the foamed-milk consistency of the thing, and in part from Polar's facility with the line, threading a single morphing idea through chord change after chord change, song after song. Minor becomes major and major turns ostrich-headed just as swiftly, lunging deep into dark soil. Too much music these days (not to mention music criticism) gets hung up on the nouns and adjectives, and forgets to pursue the verbs: on the sparkling cello and oogly bass lines, instead of the means by which they become something other than a collection of patches and sequences, a clever set of memory jogs. That's the beauty of Polar's hanging garden: It's not a Zen arrangement to be appreciated for its static beauty. Every vine's alive, wrangling and untangling, via black holes of recent musical history and the clever now-ness of the best pop, its way clear to sunlight.","Debut record from the Juilliard-trained cellist/vocalist and Metro Area collaborator.

12 Songs,Neil Diamond,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc8abf31b7dc7155b86/1:1/w_160/f211d7e5.jpg,2005-11-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2630-12-songs/,Columbia,"Before Neil Diamond made his name as an arena-packing performer, he made his living as a Brill Building songwriter. You probably know the hits he penned for others (""I'm a Believer"", ""Red Red Wine"") as well as the many he emblazoned with his distinctive gravel-and-fireworks baritone. Yeah, the dentures-foaming fervor he inspires in his fans has made him an easy joke-butt, but that's why 12 Songs arrives with such a perfect Hollywood pitch. Rick Rubin, who helmed Johnny Cash's acclaimed final recordings (of which American III: Solitary Man was named after a Diamond tune), was supposed to pull pop's consummate showman out of the shadow of his own glitz, shining new light on the man and, especially, his songs. Well, it don't walk. As an exhibition of Diamond's songcraft, 12 Songs can be forgiven for eschewing covers, even though spare renditions of unlikely material contributed to the success of Cash's Rubin-produced efforts (belt me ""Terrible Lie"" and I'll spot you two-tenths of a ratings point, Diamond). The songwriting, however, is the problem. While the man behind 1973's character-album Jonathan Livingston Seagull and the star of The Jazz Singer certainly used to be a master of sublimely kitschy melodrama, and a levelheaded reappraisal of his best pop-- ""Forever in Blue Jeans"", ""Cracklin' Rosie"", ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"", ""Sweet Caroline""-- is overdue, Diamond once told Barbra, ""Used-to-bes don't count anymore/ They just lay on the floor."" The bulk of 12 Songs tends toward the somber, ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon"" variety of Diamond hit, except with self-important pseudo-wisdom instead of Pulp Fiction creepiness. Rubin dresses-down the compositions in sparse, close-miked arrangements Boomerized with softly picked acoustic guitars, unobtrusive strings, and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" organs-- the type of production many listeners still mistake for lack thereof. It's been said that Diamond's style could use more adornment than it gets here, but Rubin's actually done a masterful job; mawkish break-up ballad ""Evermore"" starts with an illusion of intimacy-- studio banter, solo strums-- then glides into a processional rhythm before ramping up to maximalist strings, horns, and that goosebumps-desperate croon. The song still doesn't bring me flowers: ""Was it love or just illusion?/ All I see is our confusion"". Rubin's got experience aplenty coddling codgers-- Cash, Jagger, Cuomo-- but Diamond doesn't wear imminent mortality gracefully. ""Hell Yeah"" is a ""My Way"" misfired near Cat Stevens' ""Father and Son"", all stream-of-consciousness platitudes and vain posterity-posturing. The point is, hell yeah he knows he'll be missed when he's dead, and that he's running out of time. Still, he's lived a life full of love (""love's a gift that's made for giving""), ""a life that's made for caring"", in a fishbowl on shaky ground up in the clouds. He also ""walked the line,"" oops. Interestingly overlooked in the raft of positive press already greeting this album is Diamond's ""A Man of God"", in which he sounds just like a senile, self-righteous deathbed convert. I like Diamond's voice as much as the next guy, but dude tells us he thinks it's God's. He also confidently assures us he's going to heaven when he dies (phew) and that apparently he's ""a man of peace."" What, no Presidential Medal of Freedom? Diamond's ""faith is something you can't see"" line is second only to ""a friend is someone you need"" from E.T.-inspired 1982 Diamond schmaltzfest ""Heartlight"" for boneheaded obviousness. Not all of Diamond's new songs go awry. Most just go away, their melodies dissipating, their lyrics flimsy even through those tremendous pipes. ""Delirious Love"" is the most uptempo tune, bouncing on the ""then spring became the summer"" side of ""Sweet Caroline"" (a special-edition bonus track includes Brian Wilson in the delirium). Diamond intones that ""love is all about we"" and ""it can keep you dry on a rainy day"" on the closing ""We"", which oompahs like Sir Paul's ""When I'm 64"". Of course, Macca is currently shilling for retirement services-- something even the most accomplished songwriters might eventually want to consider. Today!","Veteran singer-songwriter and showman is reined in by producer Rick Rubin, attempting here to repeat his American Recordings Johnny Cash success.

Big Boi Presents Got Purp? Volume 2,Various Artists,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a2ea9e61561daa4f52/1:1/w_160/4b243cb8.gif,2005-11-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1184-big-boi-presents-got-purp-volume-2/,VirginPurple Ribbon,"The first release from an artist imprint should never be the second volume of anything. That's just confusing. Volume 1 of Got Purp? was actually called Got That Purp, and it was a successful DJ Drama mixtape released earlier this year that combined languorous, blissful lily pad r&b with punishing 808 body-rock. This ""official"" release is softer around the edges and it's a maddening exercise in label familiarization. If the artists on a comp are unknown, the format makes sense. Problem here is the crucial artists on Big Boi's Purple Ribbon are known, cult-like figures, ripe with fluid, engrossing backstories. Purple Ribbon is the successor to Andre 3000 and Big's failed vanity label, Aquemini. Most of its artists will likely never get a whiff of a solo album, let alone another high-profile showcase. This is the way artist imprints work. Aquemini was ill-fated, releasing only Killer Mike's sincerely disruptive Monster and a disappointing LP from Slimm Calhoun before dissolving in the swirl of label politics. Now Mike, a constantly infuriated Ralph Kramden figure, Bubba Sparxxx, Organized Noize's beatific crooner Sleepy Brown, and reportedly a reformed Goodie Mob (with Cee-Lo) will headline the label's studded, studly new roster. Of course, Killer Mike's album missed its November release date, Bubba's album has been pushed back twice, and Sleepy Brown can't catch a whiff of the shine he's deserved for some time. This assemblage only goes so far in rewarding the begging and pleading of pre-Crunk Georgia hip-hop acolytes. Antwan Patton aka Big Boi possesses arguably the sturdiest, most resolute flow of any rapper working today. He handily owns the album's lead single, ""Kryptonite (I'm on It)"", methodically riding the Egyptian juke joint's quivering drum track. He also embarrasses Killer Mike and members of Konkrete, a fledgling group featuring his brother James, in the process. Big is a technician, fast but smooth, never overwhelming, always relentless. He effortlessly replicated that flow at a live show earlier this year, practically sweating charisma. ""Kryptonite (I'm on It)"" is a space-age frozen rope, clearly and succinctly sunk into the hearts of banger-aware heads. They be on that kryptonite, but only steered by Big. It's a shame the rest isn't as transcendent. Other highlights appear, if erratically. On ""Dungeon Family Dedication"" Killer Mike mourns the once-mighty collective over Outkast's ""Aquemini"" beat, questioning the state of biting and fighting. He asks ""Is it only me or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggas of Sleepy Brown back in '93?,"" notes Cool Breeze created the term ""Dirty South"" only to have it stolen by perhaps less deserving hooligans, and grieves the absence of Witch Doctor. There's lots of r&b as well, from Sleepy Brown's luminous ""Me and My Baby and My Cadillac"", which sounds like so many glasses of lemonade in the desert, to Tony Tone Toni sound-alike Scar who's ""U Got Me!!!"" is a completely incongruous sunspot but welcome nonetheless. Less interesting cooing comes courtesy of stock Tearri-whatever songstress Janell Monae, who do-do-do-dos her way through the electro-camp of ""Time Will Reveal"" and ""Lettin' Go"". Bubba Sparxxx, a beleaguered titan forever confounded by visions of mud fights and overalls, calmly delivers ""Claremont Lounge"", a sweet Georgia peach about strip clubs, laced thick with reverberating bleeps and a cameo from the dearly missed Cool Breeze. Big Boi's ""808"" featuring Bun B and Boy n Da Hood Big Gee, was already featured on Volume 1. It's fierce, but old news. And Goodie Mob does, in fact, reunite here. ""Hold On"" is classic Mob music, at once gruff and melodic over horns and snares. It's about time Cee-Lo came back, too. Interestingly, the interludes here keep this mish-mash afloat most of the time, reminiscent of Organized Noize-helmed Outkast records of old. They meld the scattershot productions. Nostalgia is a flighty bitch, though. More than anything, Got Purp? 2 makes me sad. Sad that Society of Soul and Jim Crow never blew up. Sad that smart + throwed doesn't necessarily compute these days. Sad that Sleepy might never get another album. Sad that a guy as smart as Big Boi led with Volume 2 of a damn compilation. Quoth Killer Mike: ""Man, rap need a doctor/ Which doctor?/ Bring back the Witch Doctor, feelin' me?"" ","The first release from an artist imprint should never be the second volume of anything.

Over the Years and Through the Woods,Queens of the Stone Age,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bd9d034d5c69bf2a1a/1:1/w_160/ce1e119e.jpg,2005-11-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6608-over-the-years-and-through-the-woods/,Interscope,"This might look like Just Another Live Album (complete with ugly cover art), but don't think the Queens of the Stone Age are just mailing it in with this release. What at first seems to be nothing more than a contractual obligation thing is actually an embarrassment of riches. In addition to the 20-track concert film featuring the latest incarnation of the Queens performing at the Brixton Academy in London, there is bonus footage of various band configurations and a 14-track live CD culled from the London show featuring tracks that aren't on the DVD. Not content with just giving folks straight-up concert footage (complete with hi-tech A/V jazzhanding-- more split-screen!), the Queens opt to have director Chapman Baehler interweave shots of the band frolicking around Europe (with and without animal masks), as well as some old studio and live footage. The film's intro-- Josh Homme on a poorly lit cobblestoned street, playing ""This Lullaby"" on acoustic guitar, with various archival Queens footage interspersed throughout-- is the high point of the non-concert footage. Unless, that is, you're fond of WTF skits involving a guy in a wolf mask being harassed by drunk British yobs, or grainy black'n'white clips of the Queens frolicking in Europe. Instead, give me more of Homme on stage calling a pissant heckler a cocksmoker, please. The archival footage is great as well, although the trips down memory lane can be distracting. Hearing the current Queens charge through ""Song For the Deaf"" and ""No One Knows"" is great, but cross-cutting that with footage of Dave Grohl doing damage (on the former) and Nick Oliveri dropping down low (on the latter) doesn't do right by Homme's current posse. For those of you still sighing for what once was, there's also the bonus material, a handful of live tracks from each Queens lineup. First album-era Queens is represented by grainy footage of the group performing ""Mexicola"" and ""The Bronze"" at an outdoor festival. The Rated R Queens get three tracks-- ""Autopilot"", ""Better Living Through Chemistry"", and ""How To Handle a Rope"". The Queens that MTV learned to love receive a whopping five full tracks: four from Songs For The Deaf, and ""Quick and to the Pointless"" from the previous album. Finally, nu-Queens fans get to watch ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons join in on a Mark Lanegan-lead cover of the Top's ""Precious and Grace"", as well as some wicked ""Burn the Witch"" solo action. It's all great stuff, despite the dodgy quality of the audio and video. Oh, and the actual reason this thing exists-- the Brixton Academy concert footage-- is great as well. There are some speed bumps-- ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" hits more like the novelty its naysayers claim it is, and some of the longer tracks from Lullabies to Paralyze live up to the name of their originating album in the worst way possible. Don't mind the guitar/drum solos/piss breaks, either. Those duff moments are easily offset by the rest of the set. In addition to hitting all the high points of the Queens catalog, this set includes some Desert Session cuts (like the fuck-friendly ""I Wanna Make It Wit Chu"") and the previously unreleased ""The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died"", a long and winding circus jalopy that would've been a welcome addition to Lullabies. As an extra special secret bonus, there's a performance of ""First It Giveth"" by Homme & Oliveri hidden after the credits that tugs at the We Want Nick heartstrings. But that was then, this is now, those Queens are dead, long live these Queens, blah blah blah. As a tribute to what once was, and a testimonial to what now exists, Over The Years is the good stuff. ","What could have come across as a holiday season cash-grab is instead an embarrassment of riches, a well-crafted deluxe CD/DVD package featuring the band in all of its incarnations.

Mezmerize / Hypnotize,System of a Down,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62bea9e61561daa52ef/1:1/w_160/ed2f5909.jpg,2005-11-21 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11839-mezmerize-hypnotize/,Sony,"In the past six months, System of a Down have doubled their album output: In May, the critically successful quartet delivered Mezmerize, an 11-song, 36-minute blast of hyper-aggressive riffing, breakneck rhythm shifts, and Middle Eastern accented melodies. Six months later, they're offering the second side of the album, Hypnotize, which is meant as a companion piece; Mezmerize's ""Soldier Side Intro"" begins what Hypnotize's ""Soldier Side"" ends 23 songs later. System of a Down have always evoked strong love/hate feelings from listeners. They ride the line separating thrash metal and more radio-friendly fare, with some hardcore metal fans believing the band isn't metal enough, and fans of more straightforward alterna-metal finding them too leftfield. The band's oddball characteristics are even more upfront on Mezmerize, with the group shifting styles unexpectedly and incorporated more non-Western sounds than ever before. The songs generally gravitate toward one of two extremes-- rapid-fire, full throttle thrash songs, such as Mezmerize's ""Cigaro"" and Hypnotize's ""Attack"" and ""Dreaming"", or slow, heavy songs like Hypnotize's title track and ""Holy Mountain"". Mezmerize's strongest moments are when the band drops the eccentricities and just rocks out: On the two-minute ""Cigaro"", Serj Tankian's dominating vocals go from growl to howl while the band thrashes along behind him, and single ""Question!"" morphs from whispery and acoustic to loping and menacing. For the most part, the same holds true on Hypnotize, with musical mannerisms working best when they're accenting songs rather than controlling them. As the less ambitious of the two albums, Hypnotize is at once more aggressive and more restrained. ""Dreaming"", one of the strongest tracks from either album, builds layers of vocals, varying rhythms, and harmonies over blast- beat drums. Later, on ""Holy Mountain"", the band syncs up, firing every beat, every stroke, and every syllable together, punching their way through the track. The biggest problem on both of these albums is the increased vocal presence of guitarist/primary songwriter Daron Malakian. On the band's second album, 2001's Toxicity, Malakian's voice was a welcome accent to front man Serj Tankian's commanding, operatic howls and barks. But now, Malakian sings on every song, in some cases as the lead vocalist. Tankian's voice has always been one of the most unique aspects of the band, and to hear him step aside for Malakian's whiny, nasally drawl is a disappointment. The fact that his voice is generally clear and easy to understand only accentuates an underlying problem that has haunted the band from day one: terrible lyrics. At some point, the words just become unintentional comedy. At their best, they're nonsensical and garbled; at their worst, they're full of forced rhymes, juvenile shock tactics, and failed intellectualisms. Mezmerize give us ""B.Y.O.B."", with lines like ""Why don't presidents fight the war?"" Later we get ""Violent Pornography"", which sidesteps actually attacking the degrading of women for lines like, ""It's a violent pornography/ Chocking chicks and sodomy/ The kind of shit you get on your TV."" Hypnotize is no better. On the plaintive ballad ""Lonely Day"", Malakian croons, ""The most loneliest day of my life/ Such a lonely day/ Should be banned/ It's a day that I can't stand."" He never reveals what this day is, but my theory is that it's when he got a failing grade on his 9th grade poetry project. As with any double album, the question inevitably arises as to whether or not this could've been pared down to a single. Admittedly, there are a few tracks that just don't work. Mezmerize could do without ""Old School Hollywood"" (a failed attempt at new wave, with confounding lyrics about a celebrity baseball game) and ""Violent Pornography"", while the only real blunder on Hypnotize is the simplistic ""U-Fig"", which is far too repetitive in the verses, and never quite takes off. So, while these albums aren't likely to change the mind of dissenters, the band's voice remains ferocious and unique, even if what they're actually saying isn't necessarily worth hearing.",,7.1,
Nexterday,Ric Ocasek,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b998ea9e61561daa700e/1:1/w_160/e9ae637b.jpg,2005-11-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5935-nexterday/,Sanctuary,"In an aught-nickel chock with bests-since-they-were-goods, Ric Ocasek is the rare once-was not angling for such faint kudos. Nope, the erstwhile Cars front-skinny-man opts with Nexterday for overlookable adult-pop sophistication, a humble homemade comedown from its Billy Corgan-produced 1997 predecessor, heavy near-miss Troublizing. A record for the pre-converted, Mr. Porizkova's latest aims not to wow or to woo but to waft, stripped down, in the conditioned chill of compact guitar squiggles, reverby vox, fastidious drum machines, and pleasant-enough platitudes. The for-the-fans approach goes farthest when the geezer in question indulges the idiosyncrasies that made him beloved in the first; see Jonathan Richman's ongoing efforts. OK, sleek and tight were always Ocasek trademarks, but lean doesn't mean bony, and Nexterday wins when Ocasek strikes out into quirkier territory. The familiar synths are a good start, particularly on catchy ""Come On"", where a classic Cars line meets Tango in the Night sparkle. Playful lyrics crop up intermittently, as on ""Don't Lose Me"", with couplets like ""Don't let me down/ Don't take my red chromium cup"", and ""Carousel"", where clean guitar revolves carousel-like around a child-simple bass and Ocasek's still-Louie ""Silly clown/ There's rain in your shoes."" But while Ocasek may play most of the instruments here, the songs often could be anybody's; see the lowlights of last year's Finn Brothers' return. ""I just want to hold you tight/ Make sure everything it feels all right,"" Ocasek opines over too-pristinely chugga-chugging guitars on ""Bottom Dollar"", sounding more like a neutered Tom Petty. Soft-loud dynamics on opener ""Crackpot"" are torpedoed by excessively inoffensive production. ""Please Don't Let Me Down"" echoes ""Don't Lose Me"" (""don't let me down"") and ""Carousel"" (""I'm going round and round"") in regretful guitar ballad form. Sometimes dude's entirely half-assed: On ""In a Little Bit"", with a ""Down Under"" rhythm, Ocasek's all, ""In a little bit you will know/ If it's all just rigmarole."" Then again, an old new waver who has it all and a bag of Circuit City royalty checks can be expected to sound a little complacent-- almost excused for it. Especially when he buries a couple of subtle pleasures toward the end of the album: Best Hiccupping Chorus goes to simple, catchy love ditty ""Heard About You"", and Best Guitar Solo (in a Lindsey Buckingham role) goes to closer ""It Gets Crazy"", which Nexterday unfortunately never does. Maybe tomorrow?","Former Cars leader and veteran producer aims for adult-pop sophistication on his latest LP.

For some reason, Albert Hammond, Jr. can rip Wire and Television riffs helter-skelter, but as soon as Tangiers encroaches on anything pre-1980, whistles blow. Unfair, yes, but that's just the biz. To compensate, Tangiers plays up their ""underdog"" status to a T, which is fine, except the diamond can only hide in the rough for so long. So, in a deft move, the whittled-down songwriting duo of frontman Josh Reichmann and singer/bassist James Sayce have stopped fumbling over tinny Strokes production and instead deliver the raw mod album the Mooney Suzuki never had the sobriety to create. Thus, the underdog becomes alpha wolf as Reichmann and Sayce display an newly discovered authority over their songs. Opener ""Crack Valley"" would've been shackled by half-assed Clash guitars and boombox-quality drum tracks on 2004's Never Bring You Pleasure. Fortunately, the band checks their DIY tendencies at the door, bringing mostly melody and unpredictable tempos to the party. Not to malign their previous catalog, which certainly trumps most of today's post-punk regurgitates, but Family Myth proves fewer studio tricks lead to tighter songwriting. All soulful melodies and tender keyboards, ""That Russian Bastard"" woos the ear enough to excuse the Casablancas mimicry and curiously anti-Russo sentiments. Likewise, ""A Winter's War"" conjures a cuddly Smiths sans sad bastardy and nasal blockage. However, Tangiers hasn't troubleshot all their stylistic errors, namely the anachronistic psych musk creeping through Family Myth. One-dimensional tracks ""The Coast Guard"" and ""I Suggest a Crypt"" sound like the Coral pranking Tangiers, swapping 70s energy with lysergic homogeny. Nevertheless, Tangiers make a good first impression on their Frenchkiss debut, settling comfortably into their status as Canada's ripple-- not direct answer-- to the U.S. garage boom. Props to 'em, but even more power to the hordes of indie taxonomists who can stop fretting over which buzz bin to file the band into.","Frenchkiss indie rockers shrug off the sub-Strokes/Walkmen tags by delivering a raw, rich mod album.

Born to Run: 30th Anniversary Edition,Bruce Springsteen,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64dc0084474cd0c0920/1:1/w_160/7522c2d3.jpg,2005-11-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/,Columbia,"Try to picture the rock scene in 1974, when Bruce Springsteen started writing and recording the album that would thrust him into the national consciousness. Elvis had hit merely 18 years prior; Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and the Beatles had died or called it quits only three or four years earlier. Bob Dylan had been at it for a while and potentially seemed dated, though he was still only 33. The weight of pop music history was something that could be shrugged off, and with so much unexplored territory, bands felt an obligation to see where rock music might yet go. In this environment Springsteen was just 24, still a kid; he'd been hailed as the New Dylan and had recorded two quirky albums but he wasn't a star. He had talent and ambition in equal measure but the thing that would put him over was his vision. Springsteen believed like no one else in the power and possibility of rock, which led him to places that seem strange and maybe even awkward to those who grew up with MTV and everything punk came to symbolize. His naïve but inspiring outlook found its purist expression in Born to Run, which Columbia has now reissued in a deluxe 30th Anniversary Edition packaged with two feature films-- one documentary and one concert-- on DVD. Born to Run is a distinctive record, even in the Springsteen canon. Its world is one of impossibly romantic hyperrealism, where the mundane easily becomes fantastic, and it all happens line by line. Picture the depressed state of the Jersey Shore in the early 70s, the dull sense of an era gone, and then check Springsteen's description in the title track: ""The amusement park rises bold and stark and kids are huddled on the beach in the mist."" This could have been a couple of bored teenagers sitting on a bench bullshitting, but with Springsteen's imagery, some glockenspiel, and a deep sax drone, it's transformed into filmic splendor. The next phrase ups the ante: ""I want to die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss."" From one angle it's the kind of line that can make you wince, at best a silly emo cliché. The way Springsteen sang it in 1974, it wasn't a dorky diary confessional; it was unhinged expressionism, Kerouac with a bottle of red wine in his stomach. While everyone was zoning out in front of the TV this scruffy dude saw an opera out on the turnpike and a ballet being fought in the alley. He wants to know if love is wild and real, he says, but reality isn't a particularly useful concept in the context of this record. A masterpiece Born to Run may be, but only on its own terms. Springsteen at this point didn't know much about women or relationships (""She's the One"" is powerful and catchy but fails as a portrait of an actual person) but he had an instinct for drama, and his stories focus on plot and circumstance rather than character. Nearly every song touches on the central mythical image of the rock'n'roll era, the ideas of escape and abandon. The protagonist in ""Thunder Road"" thinks everything will change if he can make it out of town. The workers in ""Night"" suppress their daily rage by disappearing into a dark theater of sex after the whistle blows. Conflicts are all man vs. environment and man vs. society; Springsteen would get around to man vs. himself later, after he'd settled down and lived a little more. The size extends to the sound, greatly improved on this reissue with the first wholesale remastering since it was first released on CD. Phil Spector was a well-known obsession of Springsteen's at the time, a logical complement to the room-sized thematic canvas he'd stretched. ""Jungleland"" and ""Backstreets"" are famously epic, but shorter songs like ""Thunder Road"" and ""She's the One"" seem constructed as mini-suites, with tinkly intros building to immense climaxes. The title track was Springsteen's ""Good Vibrations"", toiled over endlessly in the studio and smothered with endless layers of god knows what before finally being abandoned, flawed and perfect, to the loving arms of radio. His voice would never sound quite this strong again-- perhaps he never pushed it as hard-- and the slap-echo trailing a split second behind adds to the effect. The first DVD, a complete 1975 show from the Hammersmith Odeon, is a major find. For someone like me who never got over the disappointment of only one song from 1975 on the Live 1975-85 box, this film is a revelation. The opening piano and harmonica version of ""Thunder Road"" is the scene setter, with a dim spotlight on Springsteen alone on a darkened stage and Roy Bittan playing somewhere behind. When the rest of the band joins him they have a ball, with a performance in turns earnest, theatrical, melodramatic, and clowning. It's an absolutely essential item in the Springsteen discography. Wings for Wheels, the VH-1-ish documentary on the making of the record, is a third too long and will be of only marginal interest for anyone other than committed fans, but there's still something important here. If you can get past the repetitive and fawning testimonials from the band, producers, manager, etc., there's a wealth of information about the technical process of the album, with demonstrations of how songs evolved over time. Hearing the various parts of the dense ""Born to Run"" picked apart, for example, just the acoustic guitar or saxophone isolated, is like a mini course on how songs are mixed. There's also Springsteen's own commentary on the songs-- what they mean and how he wrote them-- which is interesting if not always consistent with how I hear the record. When he says toward the end of the film that Born to Run was ""the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom-- it was the dividing line,"" it seems to me he's exactly wrong. A dividing line may be visible, but Born to Run lies entirely on the dreamy and reckless side of maturity and is all the better for it. Every young person should be so lucky, to have a time in his or her life when the inflated romanticism of Born to Run makes perfect sense.",,10,
dios (malos),dios (malos),by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6b5e6ef95969322bec/1:1/w_160/92897f91.jpg,2005-11-17 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2545-dios-malos/,StarTime,"What happened? Dios have erased their charming West Coast psychedelica, full of carefully furrowed details and clever Beach Boys tributes. It's as if conceding to Ronnie James Dio and adding a parenthetical to their name meant conceding to make more populist middle-of-the-road rock, because their second self-titled (but not redundantly titled) record turns the dial from Brian Wilson to Joe Walsh. Opener ""Feels Good Being Somebody"" throws out several leaden one-liners (""I take drugs/ But sadly I can't afford 'em"") over stilted muted chords, then adding a bright jangle to lyrics about singing ""a little song called marijuana in the sun"" and, finally, ""see how they run."" From there the songs go through several inventive instrumental shifts, though they all recall the broadest touchstones of late-1960s and early-70s rock. ""Say Anything"" turns a gentle guitar pluck and drum machine into nondescript navel-gazing ""Dear Prudence"" clone, and there's a bit of swing to the southern-fried guitar licks of ""I Want it All"", but the swaying campfire strum of ""So Do I"" is a sterling example of why artists should never build rhyme schemes around the word ""high."" (Chorus: ""I get high/ So do I!"") Were there some variation to the flat-footed rhythms, were the guitar parts and organ flourishes not so predictable, they might get away with it, but the lyrics are always the focal point. Further into the record, the band invests in smaller details, and when it does the songs overcome the lyrical shortcomings. The lurching tempo changes and keyboard effects of ""I Feel Fine all the Time"" elevate its simple melody, and the joy of studio manipulation is more palpable here, perhaps because the structure's a little looser. ""Goin' Home"" shares that same informal feel, with a layer of radio static reinforcing adding a claustrophobic air to the words (""I'm over everybody/ I've got no patience left""), and the band dynamics feeling less rehearsed and stiff, tempos dropping and picking up while a few jagged guitar lines dart in and out. It's difficult to hold the rest against them, because the approach hasn't changed, really-- feeding 60s rock through an earnest, austere indie filter. The lyrics from the previous self-titled album didn't merit a Nobel or anything, but they weren't this distracting. Rock isn't poetry, and there's always a balance between clever and phonetically pleasing lyrics; But when playing in a style this broad and predictable, you ought to say more than dios (malos) do in ""Grrl:"" ""I'll love you to the end (2x)/ Psyche, I'm just kidding.""","West Coast band gets a new name and a more populist, MOR sound.

Are You Really Lost?,Matias Aguayo,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1cfea9e61561daa48b7/1:1/w_160/8b5e5a11.jpg,2005-11-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/489-are-you-really-lost/,Kompakt,"Closer Musik were always Kompakt's best-kept secret. Known primarily for their contributions to Totals 2 und 3-- the anti-gravity ballad ""One, Two, Three (No Gravity)"" and the fat, chiming techno of ""Departures"", respectively-- the duo of Dirk Leyers and Matias Aguayo also released the criminally ignored After Love. The thick, throbbing electro (which sounds right on time in 2005) of After Love was a Trojan horse for Aguayo's lecherous whispers, which ranged from dirty (""ride ride me baby"") to plain bizarre (""day by day I love to shave myself""-- wtf?). When Closer Musik quietly imploded, the generally held belief was that Leyers was responsible for the musik and Aguayo for the sleaze that elevated it beyond straight techno/electro. Leyers' 2005 single ""Wellen"", also for Kompakt, reveled in the bubbling, melodic strains of CM tracks like ""Departures"" and ""Maria"". So it's unsurprising that Aguayo's debut album under his own name continues in the minimalist grind he brought to ""Closer Dancer"" and ""Ride"". Aguayo describes his music as ""for the city and for the night,"" and Are You Really Lost? definitely fits that description, for better or worse. Aguyao produced the album himself with help from Marcus Rossknecht, and the sound is noticeably thinned out from the Closer Musik days (no more wormlike basslines or bright, toppy melodics). This is a record designed for headphones; listened to at normal volume on a stereo, large swathes of it are swallowed up by its own dynamics. Aguayo's voice isn't quite so affected anymore; unfortunately, this has stripped his delivery of some of its charm and directness. Plus his lyrics are still largely nonsensical come-ons, that is when they're not husky breaths or sexual nonsense delivered as if it was going to magically unzip flies. When it works, as on the title track or ""New Life"", it's as odd and shivery as the Closer Musik material. When it doesn't, as on ""Radiotaxi"" or ""So in Love"", it just feels forced. Like 2005's other electro-sleaze notable, Chelonis R. Jones' Dislocated Genius, Aguayo's debut isn't wholly successful. Sometimes in all the skittering rhythms and thick, musky, dusky production murk you long for a big fat hook. But Aguayo's vision is still creepy and seductive, especially when viewed through the de-sexualized lens of so much European house and techno. It's a bit like Ralf leaning over to slip his tongue in Florian's ear.","First solo album from the randy half of Kompakt's criminally overlooked Closer Musik.

Stories for Owls,Badgerlore,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f513d197565213875e/1:1/w_160/d82f654a.gif,2005-11-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/525-stories-for-owls/,Free Porcupine Society,"Those already steeped in Badgerlore lore will recognize the setting: off in the distant consciousness, naturalist in ethos, quiet and precise in sound. Fuck a myth though (if you must, ""the music is organized around the conceptual theme of birds constructing nests""), and a wood cult too, cause the coercion just cheapens it. What's there is enough-- tired three-chord progressions, ineffable human noises, long silences, and longer delays: Stories for Owls finds its real charm in the absence of dictation. The pieces fall out, nametags pre-applied, with Ben Chasny (Six Organs of Admittance) and Deerhoof refugee Rob Fisk at work together as Badgerlore from as far back as 1998, here with two new players, Tom Carter (Charalambides) and Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans). Sound expansion's the upside, extra blood yielding an easy interplay between warbling organs and guitars, wordless vocals, and gentle tape manipulations. Organic sure, but the Stories for Owls touchstones are, in their intellectualism and breadth, surprisingly more art than folk, recalling Eno's Ambient series, Laurie Anderson's warmer vocal narcissism, and even John Cale's early, occasional organ visitations. At their most bare, as on ""Stone Stick Earth Brick"", Badgerlore stitch full-grown songs out of one or two aural ideas. The jump-off's a lackadaisical three strums, the gaps between iterations filled in by sympathetic note clusters and, later, by falsetto harmonies. The vocals, gradually manipulated, circle up and up, filling space formerly uninhabited and stark. Less structured and more purely ambient is ""String Wrist"", anchored by organ that fades off away from the speakers, the echo buoyed by two guitars and epic delays. Even the silences go long, interrupted only by fragile bursts of keys, pulling together, with only a few sounds, an almost subconscious logic. ""III"" follows the same meandering path: broken teeth piano, shimmering and bent guitar, banging away with what's at hand. But all good intentions to one side; the medium, round here, is the message. Meaning inclusive, back-to-nature forest music must include, or it's cruel before it's kind. So credit the appeal, on top of a very generous sound, to a rare transparency. In the record's silences, you can actually hear hands on strings, and then the pluck, pull and plectrum that give rise again to their unadorned sound. The harmonica of ""Your Discomfort, My Happiness"" is not so much played as breathed in and out of; the only song to feature remotely traditional playing (a sort of bare-bones raga gesture), the players are all nearly as audible as their instruments. This melding goes literal in the all vocal, all four players farewell ""Building a Nest"", which bypasses the instruments entirely in favor of the instrumentalists. Otherworldly is not the word, though it's tempting; fact is, it's easy to see where Stories for Owls comes from.","Ben Chasny (Six Organs of Admittance) and Deerhoof refugee Rob Fisk draft in Tom Carter (Charalambides) and Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans) for their side project's latest release.

Tiny Cities,Sun Kil Moon,by: Stephen M.

Modest Mouse's music, more so than with many other bands, is nearly inseparable from the musicians themselves. Isaac Brock's spitting delivery determines the vocal melodies and his particular hardluck perspective determines his logic-puzzle lyrics. But his voice and words are only two gears in a much larger mechanism, and as such, for better or worse, they depend on the other cogs to turn them-- the rangey guitarwork that trails through the songs like sparks off a campfire, the staggering and surprisingly melodic basslines of Eric Judy, the strength and fluidity of Jeremiah Green's drumwork. They don't attempt many versions of others' songs, either; in fact, their only recorded cover to date is an instrumental-- Santo & Johnny's ""Sleepwalk""-- to which they added dreamy vocals, nocturnal lyrics, and a descending arc of guitar notes to offset the moody original. Suffice it to say, Kozelek gets mauled on Tiny Cities. He attempts 11 covers, including tracks from every Modest Mouse full-length-- from Sad Sappy Sucker to Good News for People Who Love Bad News-- but his band only takes one or two musical elements from the Modest Mouse originals, so the songs sound pale and diminished compared to your memory of their source. Like Modest Mouse, Sun Kil Moon work best when Kozelek controls every aspect of their music, from the lyrics to the arrangements to the instrumentation. Brock's lyrics only highlight Kozelek's limitations as a singer: He has a commanding voice but molasses phrasing, which restricts the versatility of his interpretations. And Sun Kil Moon don't show as much range on Tiny Cities as they did on their debut, Ghost of the Great Highway. Their tasteful Americana is long on atmosphere but short on real dynamics: Most of these tracks sound more or less uniform, which is odd considering the variety of the Modest Mouse versions. Divorced from their original contexts, Brock's lyrics don't fit easily into Sun Kil Moon songs. ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" suffers worst, trading the original's bizarre bass bounce and aggrieved alienation for a lackadaisical pace and chiming vocals. Kozelek punctuates each line with an awkward two-syllable theme, sung in a slightly higher register-- ""oh no"" or ""my throat"" or ""coca-COLA"". It's an awkward fit for elements that didn't translate well. Nothing else is quite so egregious, but most of these tracks sound silly as they try to anchor Modest Mouse's otherworldly songs to an earthly sound. ""Dramamine"" and ""Convenient Parking"" attempt to churn up dark tension, but fall flat. On ""Never-Ending Math Equation"" Kozelek switches out the accents and long notes in the vocal melodies, but it's ruined by the mumbling chorus that attempts to literalize infinity. And the closer, ""Ocean Breathes Salty"", sounds particularly guileless and mopey in this strictly acoustic setting, a coffeehouse encore that carries little impact. Despite the stumbles, Kozelek does get a few good hits in before the bear devours him. A short take on ""Exit Does Not Exist"" contains a hint of an overture: Atop a gently plucked guitar, Kozelek sings, ""I hear voices insinuating/ Feeds me words to this song that I am singing""-- using Brock's words to explain and maybe even apologize for the project. The string arrangements stand out on ""Space Travel Is Boring"" and ""Jesus Christ Was an Only Child"", suggesting the weightlessness of the former and the infinite uncertainty of the latter. ""Grey Ice Water"" comes across as the most successful undertaking: Against a snare drum rhythm that scratches out a steady march tempo, Kozelek plays up the song's implied narrative, creating the sense of a long distance traveled-- which recalls the road-trip aesthetic of Modest Mouse's This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About and The Lonesome Crowded West. But such moments are very dim lights in a dark space, and only serve to highlight the major flaw of Tiny Cities: These tracks are botched experiments that can't even function as interesting failures.","Mark Kozelek's full album of Modest Mouse covers features selections from the Pac NW band's career.

Full of Light and Full of Fire,The Mendoza Line,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4315e6ef959693239d9/1:1/w_160/cb4e1dc1.jpg,2005-11-16 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5228-full-of-light-and-full-of-fire/,Misra,"In the eight years since the Mendoza Line released their brilliant debut, Poems to a Pawnshop, a lot has changed for the band. The group moved from the indie music Mecca of the south-- Athens, Georgia-- to Brooklyn, while at the same time the shaggy-haired style of that debut-- rollicking guitars, catchy leads, sing-along choruses and slightly off-key harmonies-- has been marginalized in the current indie landscape. Over that time, the Mendoza Line have slid toward alt-country while retaining a great deal of their initial charm. Seventh album Full of Light and Full of Fire isn't exactly a concept record, but it's definitely held together by a few running lyrical themes. Songs bounce between narratives about love and loneliness and more sociopolitcal topics such as women's rights in Saudi Arabia and President Bush. Fortunately, band's primary songwriters, Shannon McArdle and Timothy Bracy, are adept at presenting heavy topics with a light hand. Nothing here feels like soapboxing; instead, the lyrics are subtle and poignant, with as much emphasis on storytelling as dissent. The songs addressing more personal matters are especially affecting. ""Water Surrounds"" deals with a single mother suffering from post-partum depression who is afraid to tell anyone how she feels. McArdle's delicate voice gives life to the lyrics, and the sadness surrounding the song's narrator is apparent. On ""Settle Down Zelda"", Bracy sings of a fiery, life-hardened woman dealing with the hand that's been dealt to her. Perhaps she finds the right companion in the end, however, as Bracy croons, ""Hey baby it don't mean shit to me/ That you got a history/ God knows that we've both been around,"" in his typically nasal fashion. Musically, the disc runs the gamut from slow, dusty ballads to tight, barroom rock songs. ""Rat's Alley"" recalls the Pretenders' ""Middle of the Road"", and slaps catchy acoustic leads over upbeat, jangly indie rock. ""Golden Boy (Torture in the Shed)"" is a driving, mid-tempo beast, with squealing, noisy guitars and a drumbeat that relies almost solely on snare drum. McArdle's stark vocals are front and center, demanding attention. One of the best assets the band has is the dueling male/female vocals, best exemplified on closer ""Our Love Is Like a Wire"", a tender love song about an elderly couple recounting the years they've spent together. The applause that begins and ends the track conjures visions of couples like Johnny and June Carter Cash, singing to one another, almost oblivious to the crowd in front of them. It's a sweet end to a disc full of songs of bitterness, loneliness, and disillusion.","Veteran indie band move between narratives about love and loneliness and sociopolitical concerns.

You Can't Beat Tomorrow,The Howling Hex,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c171ea9e61561daa7da0/1:1/w_160/1576efbb.jpg,2005-11-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4004-you-cant-beat-tomorrow/,Drag City,"Despite some exasperating foibles, one can't accuse Neil Michael Hagerty of being unambitious. Earlier this year, the former Royal Trux monarch released All-Night Fox, the first CD credited to his new combo the Howling Hex. For their follow-up You Can't Beat Tomorrow, Hagerty and company have heedlessly raised the ante, combining a CD of new material with a DVD containing the ""pilot episode"" of the Howling Hex's new variety show. It all makes for a package as inexplicable as it sounds, but it might be the most consistently engaging music of Hagerty's post-Trux career. You Can't Beat Tomorrow isn't Hagerty's first foray into the video arts. In 1992, he and Royal Trux-partner Jennifer Herrema made the paranoiac, drug-addled rockumentary What Is Royal Trux? wherein, among other things, the duo was pursued by Nixon-masked government agents. By that chaotic standard, the video presentation of You Can't Beat Tomorrow seems relatively subdued, featuring a vivid collage of newspaper clippings, stock footage, and crude animations alongside the Hex's staged musical performances. This pilot sports the type of dimly-lit, shot-on-VHS production one might identify with late-1980s cable access programming, which does give the proceedings a certain homely, DIY charm. The DVD's longest non-musical segment is a rudimentary cartoon that follows the activities of what appears to be a monkey (the protagonist from Hagerty's 1997 novel Victory Chimp, perhaps?) and his friends working down at Henry's bar. Amusing though it is, if this diversion was intended to have some larger overriding point I'm afraid I missed it. Elsewhere, though, Hagerty does make a few clumsy attempts at satirical media commentary, such as on the short, nonsensical ""making-of"" documentary or the Howling Hex's 2003 TV commercial that the DVD includes as ""extras."" If the rest of this disc is intended as a broad media lampoon, however, it rings hollow and strangely anachronistic, as perhaps somebody should gently inform Hagerty that variety shows such as he's spoofing aren't really produced any more, if they ever were. The Howling Hex fare considerably better on You Can't Beat Tomorrow's musical portion, although characteristically Hagerty's new material sounds almost totally unlike that on All-Night Fox. Hagerty is here backed by the Texas roots-rock outfit The Theater Fire, who augment these songs with banjo, accordion, fiddle and trumpet. As can be seen on the DVD, tracks like ""Cobra Heart"" feature as many as four guitarists, yet the album retains a tinny, sepia-toned veneer, as though all of the musicians were forced to perform gathered around a single vintage microphone. Nevertheless, songs like the atmospheric ""No Numbers"", or the instantly catchy title track are as appealing as any Hagerty's cut in years, with the expanded group's grainy tang landing somewhere between the Allman Brothers and The Basement Tapes. As with All-Night Fox, the highlights here are enough to suggest that perhaps Hagerty has turned yet another artistic corner, and to spur on the fading hope that at some point he'll again be able to squarely direct all his flighty ambitions into one decisive (and preferably musical) statement.","CD/DVD pacakge from Neil Michael Hagerty contains the ""pilot episode"" of the Howling Hex variety show.

Under an Hour,Menomena,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43fea9e61561daa80e5/1:1/w_160/1640b9d2.jpg,2005-11-16 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5556-under-an-hour/,Film Guerrero,"In late 2003, Menomena rocketed to acclaim from self-released obscurity in a matter of months. For a lot of bands, the vault to fame (at least fame in the world of blogs and webzines and music junkies) would be either paralyzing or ego-inflating, but neither affliction seems to have come over them. They simply took their time, toured a bit, re-issued their debut on a label, and refined their craft. Under an Hour, Menomena's honestly-titled second album (it's 54 minutes long), is frankly so different from their debut that it's hardly worth comparing the two. For one thing, it's made up of three long instrumentals composed to soundtrack the work of a dance troupe called the Monster Squad, a nominal association that seems almost too perfect. Menomena originally played these three compositions over a three-day span at the T:BA:04 time-based art festival in Portland, Ore., each one accompanying a different Monster Squad routine-- judging from the photos on their website, it was an interesting series of performances. The titles of the songs straightforwardly describe the foreign materials used during each dance: ""Water"", ""Flour"", and ""Light"". Of course, when you listen to the album, you can't see anyone dancing, so how cool it all looked and sounded when it was happening is somewhat moot. That's okay; unlike many soundtrack/installation pieces, it's quite listenable on its own, falling roughly in the same chamber music realm as Rachel's or Max Richter, though more stretched out and less orchestral. In a way, it's a logical extension of the way the band uses shifting textures and musical juxtapositions in the service of its pop songs. Each piece embodies a handful of themes and cycles its way unhurried through them, returning to them occasionally and slowly altering the instrumentation. Each piece has multiple tension points and crescendos to keep your ear engaged for a hard listen, but it honestly works best as background music. ""Water"" is, humorously, the most fluid piece on the album, opening with a disarming banjo part and relying primarily on piano for its backbone. Acoustic guitar and what sounds like violin but might not be give the music heavy emotional weight, but the lack of a sturdy rhythm track makes it simultaneously dreamy and inviting. ""Flour"" is the most rhythm-conscious song, built mainly around a staccato sax figure and featuring some stunning crescendoes built around cymbal-heavy drumming. Glockenspiel tinkles in the background, balancing the aggression of the sax part and smoothly introducing the piano-dominated mid-section. ""Light"" layers long guitar and organ drones for more than five minutes, flirting with unsettling dissonance. Rhythm slowly begins to emerge through mild interruptions until finally we're left with nothing but a steady morse-code pulse, which the band then builds into the next section with clipped percussion samples and, ultimately, live drumming. Luckily, Menomena's artistic success doesn't seem to be changing them a great deal.

Hey Hey My My Yo Yo,Junior Senior,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3c9d034d5c69bf5404/1:1/w_160/792b1e4e.jpg,2005-11-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4318-hey-hey-my-my-yo-yo/,Crunchy Frog,"Even with the Vegas-size buffet of sounds that inform the music of Junior Senior, I wouldn't have pegged them as Neil Young fanatics. When the Danish duo came dancing across the water with their giddy 2003 debut D-D-D-Don't Stop the Beat, their message was one of gleeful disinhibition, hopscotching their way through any genre that falls under the wide umbrella of ""dance music."" Neil Young? He's more into songs about apocalypses, overdoses, and genocides. Nevertheless, indie rock refugees Jesper ""Junior"" Mortensen and Jeppe ""Senior"" Laursen invoke the Chief Rustie's ode to Johnny Rotten as the title to their sophomore effort, the crucial addition of a ""yo yo"" bending the original song to fit their mission statement: It's better to freak out than to mope away. Sadly, there are no soul-funk-disco-garage reworkings of ""Like a Hurricane"" to be found on Hey Hey My My Yo Yo, though there are certainly echoes of the pure, simple joy found in the famous one-note solo of ""Cinnamon Girl"". You see, Junior Senior loves to dance, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Those who never saw Junior Senior, with their sexual preference goofing and affected stuttering, as anything more than a gimmick might be surprised they've issued a second record, much less one that improves on their debut. But skeptics be damned that's just what Hey Hey My My Yo Yo is, an improvement and distillation of the duo's sound. It might not have an icebreaking single like ""Move Your Feet"", but it's much more consistent. Chalk it up to Junior and Senior easing off the genre promiscuity and settling on a sound that shopping-sprees its way through dance-floor history: The sequined strings of disco, the driving guitars of funk, the shout-along backing vocals of girl-group Motown, the dopey-rhyme silliness of early rap, and handclaps, handclaps, handclaps. After graciously thanking us, Jay-Z style, for buying our album, ""Hip Hop a Lula"" serves as the thesis statement for their proud new musical cocktail, right down to the evolution-charting name of the song. Trading in hokey rhymes (""Take me down to the parallel city/ Where the music's loud and the boys are pretty""), the track's aspect ratio widens out to Go! Team-like cop-show fanfares and violin crescendos then shrinks down to crisp, percussive electro, all in the time it takes to microwave popcorn. The Danes also spruce up their sound with guest vocalists-- female singers recruited from other bands, and the band's own Velvelettes-- who appear on the mic as often as Junior and Senior themselves. Grrl-group Le Tigre appears on no less than five tracks, returning the favor for the awesome Junior Senior remix of ""Nanny Nanny Boo Boo"" currently working the DJ circuit. The Tigres sound like they haven't had so much fun since their politics eclipsed their playfulness, whether singing backup on ""We R the Handclaps"" or enthusiastically dueting with the leads on the crisp synth-funk of ""Can I Get Get Get"" or the delirious ""Dance Chance Romance"". ""Take My Time"" takes an even more direct nostalgia-mining route, recruiting Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson from the B-52s for some cross-generational party-rock. Throughout Hey Hey My My Yo Yo, Junior Senior repeatedly thwart the impulse to perceive them as disposable or disco-era re-enactors, resisting the novelty label at every step. It's easy to forget that underneath the often silly lyrics lies a great deal of musicality, with the band tackling the Cinerama sounds of disco and Motown accurately and playfully. But most importantly, Junior Senior have fun and are funny without ever falling back on a wink; like the Darkness, their passion for neglected genres is too infectious to scoff at even when they plainly, earnestly proclaim ""I Like Music"" on the album's best track. Such a statement may not carry the hipster cache of ""rock and roll will never die,"" but it's no less clichéd, and certainly just as true.","Danish duo return with a less schizophrenic, more disco-centric album, with help from Le Tigre and the B-52's.

Bullet in a Bible,Green Day,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3c3fde0ad70b000849fdbb/1:1/w_160/Green-Day-Bullet-in-a-Bible.jpg,2005-11-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3569-bullet-in-a-bible/,Reprise,"Over the past two years, Green Day have reclaimed their Dookie platform of yore. Back then they smirked at the world from underneath green hair dye, and goaded suburban children into gleeful mud fights. More than a decade later, their superstardom is a mascara-clouded mess of sloganeering, middle age, and punk rock lip service, and the firebrand moments in 2004’s American Idiot diminish with every millionth unit shifted. Sure, there was the thrilling riff and yawp of the album’s title track, way back when. That one had some curled lip. And “Holiday” had its “HEY!”s and “AMEN!”s. Those never go out of style. But by “Wake Me Up When September Ends” it was unclear what Idiot was supposed to mean in the first place. The record still had its thematic scope, and subtitled set pieces, but with the singles played to death it was starting to sound really, really flat. “September” itself was the soggiest, a melodramatic wallow in the vein of “Good Riddance.” And it contained none of the danger and fun that Billie Joe Armstrong had congratulated himself for bringing back to rock’n’roll during his acceptance of the Best Rock Album Grammy for American Idiot. In theory Green Day’s still singing to those suburban mudslingers, the ’90s kids who grew up to find only apathy, fear, and nothingness beyond the fast food wrappers and blaring televisions. But American Idiot’s rage seems more like artifice now, especially when it’s performed from a stage of Stonesian proportions. That’s what the band's new CD/DVD set Bullet in a Bible documents, recounting their show this past summer at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes. “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda!” Armstrong rails at the disc’s outset, and the crowd of 65,000-plus go completely bonkers. Green Day continue through the “Jesus of Suburbia” suite, “Holiday,” and “Are We the Waiting” before throwing in “Longview” for old times’ sake, which leads into “Brain Stew” and “Basket Case” for the only stretch when Bullet sounds really alive. At least those songs are from an era when Green Day sounded like a band that didn’t give a shit. With American Idiot they have a real problem, because, as Bullet in a Bible’s very existence proves, their big Message Record is also a Monstrous Hit. They might have meant to beat against the Head Redneck’s agenda, might have wanted to bury a punk rock pipe bomb at the intersection between populist politics and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. But here’s Bullet in a Bible just in time for the holidays, the commercialistic addendum to Idiot's supposed apathetic anthems. Now everybody do the propaganda. Green Day can’t go backward. They can’t return to Dookie's frolic, can’t preach danger and fun when all they’re really making with Bullet in a Bible is a Green Day’d version of Running on Empty. (There’s nothing here as hilariously cheesy as “The Road,” but a few of Armstrong’s interview segments on the DVD have the clichéd “I don’t know/We do so many shows in row” air of the traveling rock superstar.) The set is loud, and Tré cool’s bass drum often resounds like he’s banging a huge pedal on the side of Texas Stadium. But Bullet in a Bible is just self-indulgence packaged as memory. Green Day’s new suburban fans will buy it; they don’t remember the band’s bratty days, and instead fell in love with Billie Joe’s pegged pants. But whatever the band was selling with American Idiot didn’t keep. If anything, Idiot and Bullet make Green Day’s next move even more pressurized. Can they be effective punk revivalists when their biggest hits sag with the ennui of middle age? Can they once again make us believe they care about our worthless trash culture lives when the records they write contribute to that superficiality? Doubtful.","Punks turned power balladeers cap a critically and commercially successful year with this CD/DVD package.

Run the Road Volume 2,Various Artists,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8305e6ef95969321156/1:1/w_160/346e9672.gif,2005-11-15 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2059-run-the-road-volume-2/,679,"It seems like ages, but it was only 10 months ago when Run the Road bumped grime into the ""next shit"" express line. Since its rapturous reception, RtR's perfect snapshot of a starving scene has paid dividends in the form of Kano's stunning Home Sweet Home LP and Lady Sov's continuing streak of munchkin tales along with her recent Stateside Def Jam deal. So, as the chorus to Run The Road Volume 2's icebreaker aptly asks, ""Who's gonna be next with 16 lines?"" With the jaw-smacking wtf?! factor vastly diminished, this sequel offers a slightly wobbly answer to that question by attempting to expand its predecessor's definition of grime in new, sometimes dubious directions. Perhaps a bit tired of the Wembley-sized arcade crunk sound, those pushing RtR2's brazen buttons try for a little more polish and nuance. The epic introduction, ""Get Set"", proves that such ambitions have the potential to be fruitfully realized. Stinging strings counteract the track's deep-digging bass while wailing backing vocals offer some cinematic shading. The song also boasts RtR2's most impressive union of mic fiends as golden boy Kano competes with Ghetto and Demon for infinite rewinds. Coming off like a grime version of Puffy's ""Victory"", ""Get Set"" successfully takes the young hybrid genre to uncharted levels of grandiosity. It also stands well above the rest of RtR2 in scope and execution. The rest of the record is hardly a failure but, next to its progenitor and sprawling opener, it gets stuck underneath a grey cloud that rains whispers of inferiority. Ghetto once again pounces and plunges into the beat with his quick tongue on ""Run the Road""; too bad the Destiny's Child leftover r&b; hook falls woefully flat in its attempt for some kind of crossover push. Although JME shows lyrical promise on ""Serious"", his one-note bitching about emcees discussing shanks and breasts quickly becomes just as trite and pointless. And No Lay's ""Unorthodox Chick"" seems to exist only as a lesser foil to her previous RtR stomper, ""Unorthodox Daughter"". Even when the record goes way out of its comfort zone as on Klashnekoff's Nas-style, grime-free ""Can't You See?"", the track's Yank tendencies are clearly second-rate. As RtR2's final two tracks suggest, maybe it was too early to tinker with grime's blood-rush Space Invader bombs. Featuring the boisterous, appropriately dubbed Bear Man, ""Drink Beer"" doesn't pussyfoot around its titular purpose as it wildly veers off the rails drunk off six pints of Strongbow. Same case with Dynasty Crew's mobster-horn blaring ""Bare Face Dynasty"", which offers a spiritual-- and sonically appropriate-- successor to RtR's completely mad ""Destruction VIP"". Both tracks revel in the chaos that much of RtR2 lacks. Still, this comp doesn't indicate grime's death knell or anything-- just its to-be-expected semi-awkward growing pains.","Follow-up to the epochal grime comp features Kano, Lady Sovereign, and Demon, among others.

New Comes and Goes,Oranger,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f19d034d5c69bf533b/1:1/w_160/89fa985d.jpg,2005-11-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6023-new-comes-and-goes/,Eenie Meenie,"After hinting at it their last two albums, the Bay Area's Oranger have finally jettisoned their cumbersome sunny psych bit, one which forcedly suggested geographic loyalty with the same conviction as a two-dimensional Captain Planet character representing his/her entire country. Now, Oranger more closely echoes indie acts such as Pavement or Modest Mouse rather than cardboard CA cutouts like Brian Jonestown Massacre or the Warlocks. Forget the dense layers of fuzz and acoustic strumming, these guitars have two settings-- clean and distorted-- and if you're lucky you'll get a mellotron in the background. This ain't your stoned older brother's Oranger. If 2003's Shutdown the Sun felt like a sweet slice of straightforward indie pop, New Comes and Goes may be lethal for diabetics and pregnant women. The melodies are Beatlesque only after being filtered through the scrappy likes of early 90s lo-fi and ennui. Frontman Mike Drake curbs his strung-out Anton Newcombe affectations in lieu of Stephen Malkmus slackerdom, half-singing, half-slurring lyrics like ""outta touch"" and ""whacha holden."" Opener ""Crooked in the Weird of the Catacombs"" launches the band's revamped sound, bouncing along on spindly guitar riffs and tinny percussion. The proceeding title track demonstrates the ideal effects of the band's minimalist change, tapping nostalgic bits of John Lennon and Roy Orbison before dirty power chords signal an up-to-date emo chorus. The band's faux-Pixies tracks really take the cake here. ""Haeter"" swaggers all space-lounge, Bossanova style, with cosmic chord changes too energized to simply plop down below the melody. On the flip side, ""Garden Party for the Murder Pride"" flaunts tacky Trompe Le Monde metal riffs juxtaposed with obtusely sunny hooks. While portions of the album recall unpleasant grunge-upchuck like Local H or Nada Surf, these guys hit a homer with the ""less is more"" strategy. Not to get all sappy, but mechanically following a band from mediocrity to above-averageness reaffirms the belief that bands can significantly improve, and not every musician from San Fran has to pay homage to the Dead.","San Fran sunshine pop band here more closely echoes indie acts such as Pavement or Modest Mouse.

Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom,Jana Hunter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1875e6ef95969323711/1:1/w_160/b4e8d863.jpg,2005-11-15 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4026-blank-unstaring-heirs-of-doom/,Gnomonsong,"To date, the solo career of Texas-born Jana Hunter has been, for better or worse, inextricably linked with Devendra Banhart. Hunter's ""Farm, CA"" appeared on 2004's Golden Apples of the Sun, the neo-folk compilation Banhart curated for Arthur magazine, and earlier this year the two singer-songwriters shared a split album on Troubleman. Now comes Hunter's first solo album, Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom, which is also the inaugural release for Gnomonsong, a new label run by Banhart and Vetiver's Andy Cabic. Professional links notwithstanding, it would be a shame to write Hunter off as a mere Banhart disciple or freak-folk footnote, as her captivating debut reveals a new, quietly radiant voice with its own strange, feverish luster. Recorded predominantly on two-and four-tracks, Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom features Hunter performing almost entirely alone, collecting songs written over the course of a decade. Had it appeared 10 years ago, it would likely have been bundled alongside the lo-fi brigades rather than as part of any broadbased folk movement. Although primarily constructed of Hunter's vocals and non-electric instruments, these songs otherwise owe very little to folk tradition, and instead draw much of their disheveled allure from her deliberately grainy, inorganic edits and overdubs. Her performances here brim with a heightened, lonesome yearning that summon the faintest trace of country twang, at times suggestive of Edith Frost's demo material as transmitted via an erratic dashboard AM radio. Prior to going solo, Hunter was a member of Matty & Mossy, an Elephant 6-like combo that put out an album of psych-pop on Houston's Fleece label. And though there are few overt psychedelic gestures on Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom, Hunter moves with a hazy, disorienting logic on multi-tracked, a cappella numbers like the opening ""All the Best Wishes"" or ""The Earth Has No Skin"", whose enveloping folds can recall Tara Burke's work as Fürsaxa. ""The New Sane Scramble"" is spiked with the distorted cry of a distant fiddle (or at least the electronic shadow of one) while on the sideways lurch of ""Untitled (Hanging Around)"" Hunter's in-the-red vocals slowly dissolve into a multi-hued, disembodied blur. The still-enchanting ""Farm, CA"" makes another appearance here, as does the brief handclap goof of ""Laughing and Crying"", which also surfaced on the Banhart split LP. But despite this album's loose and protracted creation, these songs all hang together with a natural, cohesive grace, sounding as if they had all simultaneously occurred to Hunter in one seismic burst of production. The sole exception might be the closing ""K"", which ends the album with an unexpected Casio blip of early Magnetic Fields style pop, as she sings ""I'd love to sell your backbone to my friends/ I'd be your favorite cartoon."" And though one suspects this to be a lyric Banhart wishes he had written, nowhere is it more apparent that Jana Hunter is her own artist; ready and deserving to be considered on her own singular merits.","Debut LP from Devendra Banhart compatriot is also the first release from Gnomonsong, a new label run by the Golden Apples curator and Vetiver's Andy Cabic.

No New York,Various Artists,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85b9d034d5c69bf3a14/1:1/w_160/0bbdd8aa.jpg,2005-11-15 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2105-no-new-york/,AntillesAntilles,"Historical reissues plug timelines and help unpack tendencies during eras of revival, but without the original contexts in place, the full-fledged whallop of revelation just isn't there. Even if the listener's approaching the sounds for the first time, they've ineluctably heard the ingredients' echoes. To at least maximize the effects of an aesthetic overlap, the timing of the reissue ought to be dead-on. So, though welcome and much appreciated, thank you, Lilith's officially licensed reissue of Brian Eno's 1978 No New York No Wave sampler, which he did for the Island subsidiary Antilles, has appeared a tad late. (It's more than surprising that sans some Japanese bootlegs, the compilation hasn't yet been given the royal treatment-- hey Rhino, where were you?) Yes, bands are still exhibiting No Wave tendencies (and thanks to labels like Audika, Acute, and Table of the Elements classic Lower Manhattan music of all sorts is making the rounds again), but it was circa 2002 that the post-No New York moment bubbled most briskly. S.A. Crary's 2004 documentary, Kill Your Idols, covers that time period, pairing grainy live footage and interviews with the old guard (Suicide's Marvin Rev, Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch, DNA's Arto Lindsay) and '80s noisemakers (Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Michael Gira) with newer technicolor footage and Q&A;'s with 2002's acolytes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Black Dice, Liars, et al. If you missed the film, you still might've caught some of this via the call-and-response of Vice's Yes New York compilation. Also around that time, the resuscitated Ze Records reissued its 1981 Mutant Disco compilation and other samplings on N.Y. No Wave and various James White/Contortions reissues. Soul Jazz provided the even more extensive (and less disco-flavored) New York Noise, 1979-1982 and last year No More Records' popped-up to offer the definitive 32-track DNA on DNA, which includes all of the DNA tracks from No New York. Ditto for Mars' The Complete Studio Recordings: NYC 1977-1978, out on G3G/Spooky Sound in 2003. No Wave itself sprung up namelessly circa 1977 as a reaction to punk, new wave, and New York City itself. One of No Wave's more outspoken progenitors, Lydia Lunch famously dissed punk as no more than ""sped-up Chuck Berry riffs"". James Chance has said that ""No Wave"" came from the name of the compilation, but it's also supposedly first coined by the Soho Weekly News, the ""no"" turning ""new wave""'s glossy dance party into nihilistic shorthand. Whatever the proper christening date, Eno was taken by the scene and compiled and produced No New York, which featured four tracks each from four bands-- James Chance and the Contortions, Teenage Jesus & the Jerks, Mars, and DNA. Eno recorded it lo-fi and cracked to fit with the bands' on-stage ravages. In the original pressing, the lyrics were hidden on the inside of the record sleeve, so you had to take the sleeve apart if you want to sing along. Stylistically, the bands scowled through a paranoid blitz of spastic free-jazz, art noise, jarring vocals, anti-melody, sweaty sexuality, shredding guitar, a technically adept amateurism, and Dadaist deliveries that fucked with disco (check out DNA's synth) and funk to create a sort of mangled punk avant-garde. When held up to close scrutiny, No New York's stars are more different musically than genre masturbators would have you believe, but they were connected through friendships and shared hangouts like CBGB's and Max's Kansas City. Original DNA member Gordon Stevenson left the band to play bass for Teenage Jesus & the Jerks. DNA's named came from a song by Mars. Lydia Lunch and James Chance were dating-- he quit Teenage Jesus in '78 to do his own thing. Bands who weren't as intrenched in the loop-- Red Transistor, Static, Theoretical Girls-- were left off the comp. The whole thing didn't last very long or produce much of a paper trail. Sumner Crane's brilliant boy/girl quartet Mars released a 1980 live EP and a 1986 compilation, 78+, though the band had dissolved by 1978. Besides last years' compilation-- and impossible-to-find 7""'s-- DNA had only one 10-minute full-length, 1980's A Taste of DNA. Lydia Lunch and James Chance have been better represented, especially Lunch who became a regarded spoken-word artist and author. This compilation begins with the most accessible participants, James Chance & the Contortions. Skronking through sax-based punk-funk, Chance is often compared to James Brown, but I'd rather look into my magic ball and say ""Jon Spencer."" Sporting a pompadour and Was (Not Was) suits, he made a suitable poster boy for the movement, and appeared on the cover of the first issue of the East Village Eye. As a performer, he was known for being confrontational, which got him rejected from straight-up jazz circles. Musically, he tends to grab an idea and stick with it, as on ""Dish It Out""'s unrelenting bass, drums, guitar, organ, and sax overlay. ""Jaded"" delves into freer jazz implosions and ""Flip Your Face"" shreds sounds over mid-tempo beat. His signature tune, ""Contort Yourself"", isn't here, but Eno's production makes these tracks some of my favorite in the Chance/White/Black oeuvre-- some of the later material felt too slick. Darker and less colorful, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks were fronted by vocalist/anti-guitarist Lydia Lunch, who was 16 when she joined the band in 1976. Early reviews dismissed Lunch as dreadfully amateur; nowadays, she sounds pretty tuneful screaming her gritty, anti-suburbia salvos. Teenage Jesus was known for frantic, tossed-off 10 to 15-minute sets, but here they keep it molasses slow, Lunch screaming her vocal lines over tribal drumming and minimal fuzziness. The pace pick up for the excellent 34-second rampage, ""Red Alert"", but otherwise expect a claustrophobic plod. One of the more intriguing sets comes from the least known crew, the boy/girl quartet Mars. The band's founder, Sumner Crane, who died from Lymphoma in 2003, was one of the true visionaries of this period. You'll find Daydream Nation and Lightning Bolt hiding out in the moody guitar riffs of the excellent opener ""Helen Fordsdale""; ""Hairwaves"" drifts to China Burg's ambient vocals over a fractured and spacious backdrop; ""Tunnels"" is a Crane-like static; ""Puerto Rican Ghost"" is shouting, repetitious drum rolls, and all sorts of chaos. DNA shows up in early guitar/drum/synth form. Later, when Robin Crutfhfield left to form Dark Day, he was replaced by Pere Ubu bassist Tim Wright, and the group became both sturdier and more fucked up. These pieces hit like shrapnel, though Lindsay doesn't display the more crazed (and autistic) vocal exercises of A Taste of DNA's ""Blond Red Head"" or ""Lying on the Sofa of Life"" or Mori's drumming-to-something-else-in-a-different-room percussion. On ""Egomaniac's Kiss"" Lindsay scowls (""trying to eat that self real slow"") and rattlesnake shushes along with catchy synth, simple drums. More caustic, ""Lionel"" and ""Size"" ride regurgitated synth-- the instruments shift focus halfway through, as if following the fissures of a non-demarcated fault-line. ""Not Moving"" is Joy Division stuck in a factory cog, slowly quartered. The most remarkable quality on these recordings is this unselfconscious feel, something painfully lacking in the star-fucking neo-No Wave groups. In Kill Your Idols, it's interesting to see Lunch, Lindsay, and others speak so eloquently about what it was they were trying to do. They have the benefit of hindsight, but as it unfurled and quickly disappeared, No Wave was still a real reaction plugged into a time/place. In part because there's less product, No Wave hasn't been as festishized as punk. Around 1982, bands had disappeared or sub-divided and different fragments of No Wave ended up in places like the Downtown jazz scene of John Zorn, Fred Frith, Bill Laswell, and Elliott Sharp; the noise crews of Swans, Sonic Youth, Live Skull; and dance-punk disco via Bush Tetras, Golden Palominos, Konk, Liquid Liquid, Arthur Russell, and ESG. Compare that and that to Yes New York's already dated cast of the Strokes, Radio 4, Longwave, the Natural History, and the Fever, and you'll realize New York really hasn't seen anything of the likes of these folks (and that includes No Wave's neighbors and offspring) since the last bits of that early, less gentrified Lower Manhattan feedback dried up.","Reissue of the seminal, Brian Eno-curated No Wave compilation.

Motion Sickness,Bright Eyes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a3ea9e61561daa4d1a/1:1/w_160/f0f45651.jpg,2005-11-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/945-motion-sickness/,Team Love,"Bright Eyes' new live album, cobbled together from recordings of the I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning tour, opens with the requisite applause. Buried in this applause a female voice shouts, ""Conor, I love you!"". Not ""you rock,"" not ""I love your music,"" but ""I love you."" It's a helpful clue toward understanding his widespread popularity-- Oberst's intimate, earnest music is calibrated for maximum personal identification; it's an invitation for fans to feel not just privy to his private life, but complicit in it. The magnetism of the music is in its jolts of recognition, those moments when mental states that one thought were private, from within the solipsism of youth, are revealed as universal. Another telling audience response occurs during the quiet rendition of ""Landlocked Blues"", when a smattering of cheers follows the line ""If you love something, give it away."" It could refer to Oberst's songs, with their tacit promise to not simply entertain, but to unveil something of the messy humanity of their author. In fact, it's a summary of Oberst's entire lyrical perspective and the collective twentysomething suburban worldview it excavates, an expression of the tension between two conflicting desires: For lasting security and galvanizing change. Musically, Oberst finds himself in a similarly transitional state, somewhere between the tortured no-fi manqué he was and the mellowed country singer he's becoming, and the same tension that enriches his lyrics creates some minor hitches in his musical delivery. The Bright Eyes I grew up with-- literally, we being the same age-- was always best on his own. I must've seen him play at least 10 times in my late teens and early twenties, and the most memorable performance of them all was a post-Fevers and Mirrors solo show where he shuddered, sweated, whispered, and howled over shattered-glass chords. Emotional and musical nudity make good bedfellows. And while all those vocal tics are still intact, they've been subdued-- probably for the best, in the long run. But for now, he sounds like he's still working out a new way of singing that suits the thicker country-rock arrangements he began to favor on Lifted, sometimes faltering in a sort of stifled mid-range. His band is tight, but Oberst sounds a bit tense and weighed down on heavily embellished tracks like ""At the Bottom of Everything"" and Lua B-side ""True Blue"". The tuneless protest song ""When the President Talks to God"" is another hat that doesn't quite fit, although it's pretty clearly included for political and not musical reasons, and draws approving screams from the audience. Oberst trips over a cover of Feist's wonderful ""Mushaboom"", failing to really own its tripping melody, faring better on Elliot Smith's ""The Biggest Lie"". But the most glaring example of Oberst attempting to overwrite the old Bright Eyes comes with Fevers and Mirrors' ""A Scale, a Mirror and Those Indifferent Clocks"", here tellingly billed simply as ""Scale"". Instead of reproducing its original muzziness, he couches it in I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning's genial country style, and it sounds good, if a little defanged. Barring ""True Blue"" and ""When the President Talks to God"", each of which weds overly clever lyrics to lackluster arrangements, nothing on Motion Sickness falls terribly flat-- the several uncertain-sounding tunes are simply a bit tepid, and the remainder are lovely. Oberst sounds great on ""Make War"", against its lean backdrop of guitar, pedal steel and light percussion, working the dreamy melody with aplomb and timing his screams effectively with the musical crescendos. On ""Landlocked Blues"" he seems relaxed, comfortable amid the barely-there guitars. His voice softens and opens up, threading a tremulous quaver through its easy melody. When the horn section makes a late appearance, it's effective, punctuating the quiet expanse that came before it. ""Method Acting"" plays well, avoiding swollen gestures in favor of sharp, driving rock, and ""Southern State"" is terrific, as Oberst sings confidently over a gentle arrangement including a horn solo that's expressive, not bombastic. He simply doesn't wear bombast as convincingly as he once did, and seems to know it-- this album finds him maneuvering toward a new equilibrium, one that's shaping up, judging from its most successful tracks, to be as measured and deliberate as his old songs were anarchic and accidental.","Live album issued by Team Love was recorded on the I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning tour and features covers of songs by Feist and Elliott Smith.

As the leader of Cap'n Jazz, Owls, Joan of Arc, Friend/Enemy, and now Make Believe, Kinsella has made a whole landfill's worth of extremely unique music that has passion on its side but little else. Make Believe is basically Joan of Arc, the rock-ish version. It's still disjointed, pretentious, and frequently unlistenable, but it now at least coheres occasionally into something you can latch onto and get inside of, usually just before sliding right back apart into a primordial mess. The music basically works on a principal wherein any knotty guitar riff, killer bass line, or cogent drum part must dissolve into grating chaos before it becomes too meaningful or, God forbid, straightforward. Opener ""Amscaredica (the Beautiful)"" sticks mostly to a nicely tweaked, limping groove taken from the mid-1970s King Crimson handbook, but the bits where it leaves that groove sound absolutely lost. Guitarist Sam Zurick does intriguing things with knotty rhythms, and the songs are at their best when he's in the driver's seat, picking through his little tone clusters. Otherwise, the album is like walking through a Guitar Center, with two dozen amateurs hammering away on various instruments independently. Kinsella is Kinsella, through and through-- what else would you expect him to be? The chorus of ""Say What You Mean"" is transcribed in the lyric booklet as ""How-eee-yah-oo-oowow--oo/ Hay-ee--ee--ay,"" which doesn't quite capture the ragged psychosis conveyed in his unhinged delivery. The lyrics involving actual words are scarcely more scrutable, though intriguing imagery does occasionally pop up out of the gobbledegook, like the suddenly lucid line ""she crossed her legs and made a show of dangling her shoe from her toe"" in ""Fumio Nambata Had a Farm Ee-I-Ee-I-O"". On ""One Zero"", he's ""making the bed with you in it,"" while on ""Small Apartment Party Epiphany"", someone's ""taught the cat to moonwalk, and now he's becoming a real showoff."" Do I really need to spell out that anyone who never liked Kinsella in the first place shouldn't bother with this? As relatively direct as it is, Shock of Being is still hideously overwrought. On the other hand, Kinsella's past fans aren't going to be stepping off the wagon here, either, so the album doesn't really advance the plot on either front. Rather, it's just another bizarre curio from a guy who, as much as I'd like to root for him, can't seem to make a record I want to listen to more than once.","Debut LP from Joan of Arc, the rock-ish version.

An Earwig's Guide to Traveling,Gasp,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c018c0084474cd0c3135/1:1/w_160/ad30120d.gif,2005-11-14 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3670-an-earwigs-guide-to-traveling/,CapibaraAvant Garde Farm,"Visit your local independent store and chances are you'll find a dusty copy of Gasp's 1998 full length Drome Triler of Puzzle Zoo People waiting to be discovered. In an era that's seen the rehabilitation of the criminal (Gary Higgins) and the criminally neglected (Vashti Bunyan), Gasp is to date less in line for rehab than for a first round of addiction. So it's perhaps surprising that we're seeing every vinyl and unreleased Gasp track from their short (1996-1999) and mythic (the only ""psychedelic power-violence"" band of all time) incarnation, neatly packaged as An Earwig's Guide to Traveling. In their day, on splits with Deerhoof, Noothgrush, and Volume 11, Gasp mixed Man Is The Bastard power-violence with Nautical Almanac tape manipulations/loops, pure psychedelic meditations, and gurgling noise. An Earwig's Guide contains all of the above; it is also full of nods to early and mid-1990s emo, replete with blast beats, speeded-up guitars, and full throat screams. Two songs in particular, ""Love for the Retarded Strands"" and ""Crawl Back into the Hole"", are stuffed with emo lyrics and voice-cracks, melodic guitar lines, and condenser mic overload. But the sludge, doom, and gloom that Southern Lord has now brought out of the mud are also more than presaged here; ""Shit Colony"" and ""Sore for Days"" out grief Grief, ringing out ominous chords and slugging, one-a-minute tom hits. If anyone remembers Gasp today, it would be the aging and stoned Southern California rock kids. Yet that was Gasp only about half the time. As an impatient college radio DJ, I recall skipping around their records trying to find the rock songs; yet every time the needle landed, they were off exploring outer space or locked-groove tape loops. An Earwig's Guide more than bears this recollection out. The opener here (""Where Astral Port Splits"") is delicately noisy enough to recall Boris' guitar and drone explorations, and this effect only grows (louder) on later songs like ""Conceived on the 3rd or 4th Satellite"". Even further out there are the eerily calm, warbling tape cries of ""Uranus Is Heaven"" and the water-drenched gurgle of ""Castle Sounds for the Electrical West"". Enigmatic and distracted now as they were then, Gasp's songs refuse to settle or come into focus. Their moment seems only slightly more likely to arrive now; perhaps, in another five or ten years, we'll be ready.","Collection of every vinyl and unreleased track from the late-1990s ""psychedelic power-violence"" band.

Spurts: The Richard Hell Story,Richard Hell,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c188eb335119a49ed58b/1:1/w_160/d66c92b6.jpg,2005-11-14 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4027-spurts-the-richard-hell-story/,Rhino,"Take a look at the cover of Spurts, with Richard Hell leaning forward and mugging like some collaborative product between Malcolm MacLaren and Franz Oz (though his distinctive style predated both), looking defiant and probably a little strung out on something. Flip it over: There's Hell almost 30 years later, hair grown out and dyed, face filled out, looking over his shoulder through tinted glasses at three decades of music, mistakes, band breakups, and at least one certifiably classic document of the CBGB's punk scene, Blank Generation. Spurts is not the first time Hell has compiled his own material. He collected the odds-and-sods R.I.P. when he ditched music to pursue writing in 1984; it was later expanded and repackaged as Time-- inexplicably omitting ""Blank Generation"" on both occasions. This time, the package features interview-style liner notes between Hell and critics Robert Christgau and Carola Dibbell giving background info on every track, and includes Hell's material with Dim Stars, recorded in the early 1990s with Thurston Moore, Steve Shelley, and Don Fleming. Hell himself claims this compilation should be ""his only album,"" a definitive release that would ""cut straight through"" like any album would. The Neon Boys were a precursor to the band Television; Hell was kicked out before they recorded their first album under the new name, but he was magnanimous enough to include two Neon Boys tracks at the start of the disc (not to mention close it with a live version of ""Blank Generation"" as played by Television). The preliminary version of ""Love Comes in Spurts"" had music written by Television's Tom Verlaine, and has next to no resemblance to the version on Blank Generation. But Hell's remix shows no signs of a bruised ego, pushing the guitars way up and his vocals down, serving the song well. The Stones-like fury of the rhythm guitar is well captured, and Verlaine's brief-but-inspired ascending lines can be felt in the back of your teeth. From Hell's time with Johnny Thunders' Heartbreakers, he only includes the cream of the crop, ""Chinese Rocks"". Instead, the lion's share of Spurts leans on the Voidoids' Blank Generation and Destiny Street records. The Blank Generation work has aged best, coupling punk fury with eccentric delivery and rhythm that's not afraid to swing. It also features some inspired anti-guitar hero moments from the inestimable Robert Quine on ""Liars Beware"" and ""Love Comes in Spurts"". Destiny Street would show a slightly poppier and more contemplative side to the band, though ""Kid With a Replaceable Head"" is infectiously sinister and ""Time"" and ""Ignore That Door"" show Hell's songwriting growing more frank and direct. Hell returned to recording in 1992 with a Dim Stars EP preceding one proper album. The songs chosen here mostly sound like jam sessions, like the two-chord ""Dim Stars Theme"", over which Geffen-era Thurston Moore scrawls recklessly while staying within the lines, bending the compositions but not breaking them, keeping a foothold for Hell's lyrics. ""Monkey"" is Hell at his most forthright, and the distorted guitars in the background seem incongruous with the popping clean chords and his newfound tenderness (""I swear I held my own hand pretending it was yours""). Spurts includes one more late-era compilation track from the Voidoids, ""Oh"", and two previously unreleased tracks, the Dennis Cooper-inspired ""She'll Be Coming"", which combines drum loops, Eastern tones, and a forced hillbilly accent, and the aforementioned Television of performance of ""Blank Generation"". The first side of Spurts is a righteous blast of indignant punk, and the second half indulges in some experimentation, some mood pieces, and some glances at hard-earned maturity. The best of his many compilations, and certainly the best place to start for the unfamiliar, Spurts flows as well as any original album. People still listen to those, right?","Career-spanning comp that the former Voidoids leader and Neon Boys, Heartbreakers, and Dim Stars member himself claims should be ""his only album.""

Peel Sessions,Galaxie 500,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bedeea9e61561daa7987/1:1/w_160/6b57c177.jpg,2005-11-14 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3382-peel-sessions/,20/20/20,"In his contribution to Thurston Moore's book The Art of the Mixtape Dean Wareham discusses a tape he'd made for Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang in 1987, around the time they were starting their band. ""When I look at the cassette today,"" he writes, ""I see that it is almost a recipe of ingredients for Galaxie 500."" Jonathan Richman is on it, and Joy Division and Moe Tucker and Shockabilly, all of whom would impact the band in various ways. ""If you cut random bits of this tape together,"" adds Krukowski, ""you'd probably come up with an alternate version of the first Galaxie 500 album."" Throughout their history Galaxie 500 always had a fondness for covers; from the beginning they positioned themselves firmly in the tradition of independent/underground rock. All members had good record collections and remained committed to a specific musical narrative that began with garage rock and the Velvet Underground. By plucking elements from the leftfield records that mattered to them and adding a highly personal spin, Galaxie 500 became part of the history they loved. Galaxie 500 made two visits to the BBC studios to record material for John Peel's show and the eight tracks cut are collected here. Half are covers and, as with the many the band had recorded and played live, they manage to make them sound like Galaxie 500 songs. The way they had their sound honed at this point, with Wareham's unsteady wail and spare guitar, Yang's clean, elegant basslines and Krukowski's texture-over-beat drumming, they couldn't have sounded like anyone else if they'd tried. This being the case, even the opening cover of Sex Pistols' ""Submission"" from the October 1990 has a viscous and dreamy lyricism. It's uptempo-- Galaxie 500 didn't always play slow-- but cool and controlled, and fits easily with the On Fire song ""When Will You Come Home"" from the same session. The Young Marble Giants' ""Final Day"" is, on the other hand, slowed by half, and though Yang's voice bears a similarity to YMG's Alison Statton, she finds a hint of British folk inside the song's simple melody. Buffy St. Marie's ""Moonshot"", which Wareham would later cover in his low, half-spoken voice on his album with Britta Phillips, is handled a third higher than Buffy herself sang it, with Wareham selling that upper register quaver like only he can. The September 1989 session, recorded a month before the release of On Fire, had a higher proportion of Wareham songs, the only cover being the G500 concert staple and Jonathan Richman original ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"". The opening one-two of ""Flowers"" and ""Blue Thunder"" is simply breathtaking, with every element of the Galaxie 500 sound perfectly in place. To hear these two songs one after another is to hear the best evidence on record of why this band meant so much to people at the dawn of the '90s, and ""Decomposing Trees"" is almost as good. Peel Sessions is allegedly the final piece of the Galaxie 500 story, the last recorded evidence of any significance that will be released. It's a fittingly strong ending for a band that did almost everything right.","Collection of two BBC sessions-- one from 1989, the other 1990-- features four G500 originals and covers of the Sex Pistols, Young Marble Giants, Buffy St. Marie, and Jonathan Richman.

Confessions on a Dance Floor,Madonna,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c364ea9e61561daa7ee4/1:1/w_160/3fdbeb34.jpg,2005-11-14 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5030-confessions-on-a-dance-floor/,Warner Bros.Maverick,"Twenty years ago, Madonna was a postmodernist's dream. Her ability to transform herself from song to song and from album to album became a proclamation of self-nullifying empowerment, giving her the ability to create a stationary persona out of shifting identities. However, by the start of the 1990s, Madonna's transformations appeared more calculated as she aged and fell behind the curve, trying to predict the next dominant style instead of confidently setting it. With Confessions on a Dance Floor, her 14th album, Madonna again reinvents herself, and it appears she's nearly lapped herself. Her latest iteration is a pre-Madonna (prima donna?) disco vixen, basking in a '70s musical style that she herself, among others, helped to morph and displace in the early '80s. Allowing her to accessorize creatively (love that wrap-around top), this new persona has the potential to be immensely entertaining, but there's something a little sad about it too. At 47 Madonna is playing the role of someone 25 years younger, and those retro space leotards and that feathered hair only make her look more mature and matronly, like your friend's mom dressed up embarrassingly for Halloween. If the outfit depresses, the music on Confessions accomplishes the feat of making her sound young again. Kicking off the album, ""Hung Up"" is an impressive and enjoyable single, strong enough to have everyone trying to figure out if it's her best since ""Ray of Light"" or since ""Like a Prayer"". The main groove is lifted from ABBA's ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme (A Man After Midnight)"", but used in such a way that it resembles a brilliant mash-up rather than a lazy sample. Credit is due Stuart Price of Les Rhythmes Digitales, who builds a warehouse-size wall of sound for Madonna's songs, allowing her to revel in the shameless mirrorballsiness of it all. That collaboration stays strong over the first half of Confessions. On ""Get Together"", as Price's synths ebb and flow moodily, Madonna asks the eternal pop question, ""Do you believe in love at first sight?"", over a tripping vocal melody. The cascades of sound wash directly into ""Sorry"", setting up the song's panlingual apologies and shifting bass tectonics. These songs have a deceptive lyrical vacuity that hints at greater depths, but leaves them to the listener to consider. On the other hand, ""Future Lovers"" begins with similar escapism, as Madonna warmly exhorts, ""Let's forget your life, forget your problems, administration, bills, and loans."" But it's no simple call to the dancefloor: Over a prismatic vocal theme, she unequivocally equates music with spirituality, dancing with religious ritual. This impressive momentum, unfortunately, is interrupted by ""I Love New York"", which stumbles over mad-glad-bad rhyme schemes and dumb-ass lyrics like ""I don't like cities but I like New York/ Other cities make me feel like a dork."" It sounds like a transparently targeted post-9/11 valentine to the Big Apple-- odd coming from an ex-pat. Inanities like ""If you don't like my attitude/ Then you can eff off"" are at least partly excused by Price's production, which builds from the beat up to incorporate rock elements that could be a nod to Brooklyn hipster dance punk. Despite Price's best efforts to infuse these songs with motion and finesse, Confessions never quite reaches its earlier heights after ""I Love New York"". When Madonna actually starts confessing, the album loses its delicate balance between pop frivolity and spiritual gravity. ""Now I can tell you about success, about fame,"" she intones at the end of ""Let It Will Be"", as if that's all she knows anymore. She proselytizes the Kabbalah on ""Isaac"", but despite the controversy that song has created, it's remarkable only for Price's two-note pendulum string sample and a hummed melody that could have been lifted from ""Frozen"". The young Madonna pops up repeatedly on Confessions, a foil to her older self. ""How High"" plumbs the motives behind her headline- and crotch-grabbing behavior of yore, but it only reveals how deeply she has embedded herself into the establishment. The album title recalls her contentious relationship to Catholicism on ""Papa Don't Preach"" and ""Like a Prayer"", and that pop visionary subversiveness makes her reverence to the Kabbalah seem tame by comparison. There's no conflict between her and her new faith, so there's no journey. As Confessions weighs down with more of her personal baggage, the songs become, despite Price's inventive and mercurial production, less inviting and less danceable, as if Madonna wants the dance floor all to herself.","On her 14th album, the pop star teams with Stuart Price and rolls back the clock; her latest iteration is a pre-Madonna disco vixen, basking in a '70s musical style that she herself, among others, helped to morph and displace.

South of the South,David Dondero,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5aabf31b7dc7155a86/1:1/w_160/e2fd34cc.jpg,2005-11-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2529-south-of-the-south/,Team Love,"Bright Eyes gets away with sounding like Bright Eyes because he's Bright Eyes; David Dondero sounds a lot (sometimes exactly) like Bright Eyes but comes off okay, in part because he wears his quavering death-rattle un-suburbanly, and his steamer trunk's pasted with enough regional labels for the traveling folk-rocker stance to ring authentically. Considering the wealth of detailed lyrics and quirky lo-fi maneuvers that distinguish Dondero's songs, it's weird how often they send his critical admirers rummaging through the cliché bin, exhuming the phrase ""road-weary troubadour"" and all the belabored imagery that attends it. It's probably just because there's so much content to absorb: While the music is sparse, Dondero's wordier than teenage webzine reviewer. He reels off lyrics quickly and almost constantly, inundating the listener with a dense tide of imagery and vernacular. On his sixth album, Dondero beats Sujfan to the punch by making a record about Florida, the country's extended middle finger and the place most like home for the wandering singer. The concept is clearest in geography-heavy songs like the title track and ""Brownsville Revival"". The latter is a lugubrious acoustic dirge that makes its religious iconography work overtime to contain a ponderous narrative about a bereaved father who asks a church congregation to bring his daughter back to life. The former, a sort of sociopolitical essay set to mellifluous guitars and elegiac horns, brims with purple skies and orange trees, air so thick you have to cut a slice to breathe, aquifers and swamps, hollowed out high-rises, and $30 beachfront motels. Dondero's affection for the physical aspects of Florida is apparent as they scroll dreamily through the visual frame, and his politics fill in the gaps: An appeal to muggers that ""if you're poor like me then let poor people like me be"" and a lament for the formerly artistic Cuban district, ""now a mall-like atmosphere, homogenous and insincere."" But Dondero's lyrical ambition sometimes leads him astray, and for ever finely-turned image-- the South Beach mannequins smelling of coconuts and Coppertone, for instance-- there's a conceit that's uncomfortably proud of its cleverness, like the predictable rags-to-riches-to-rags arc of gambling yarn ""Laying Low in Eli, Nevada"". And for every time Dondero nails the honest straightforwardness that's become his métier (""You could sing a simple song and still get lost in the complexities,"" he sings over the psychedelic hitches of ""Let Go the Past""), another lyric teeters on the brink of triteness. Still, Dondero's able to turn out striking images and concepts in his quest to forget the past and keep the future supple, from biting into a lightning bolt on ""South of the South"" to the willed amnesia of ""Journal Burning Party"" to the vivid language of his ode to a codependent relationship, ""Pornographic Love Song"", with its ""circus riding hips"" and ""desperate puke stained grin."" Dondero's better when he focuses more on his facility with language, less on puns and recycled sentimentality, but these deceptively rudimentary songs charm even when they don't exactly wow.","Newest album from the Team Love Bright Eyes clone.

For the Season,The Gris Gris,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c00cc0084474cd0c311d/1:1/w_160/2f3cd9c5.gif,2005-11-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3659-for-the-season/,Birdman,"When will folks stop scouring Gris Gris albums, feverishly looking for some ace in the hole, some nuanced twist to psychedelic rock? Seriously, is a no-frills psych band from San Francisco such an oddity just because they don't associate themselves with the Dead or sing about drugs? Sorry, dude in the Warlocks shirt, Gris Gris piss on hyphenated Sam Goody mongrels like ""psych-punk"" or ""trip-rock,"" but can I interest you in this poster with a marijuana leaf on it? At the same time, Gris Gris's sober take on the genre isn't exactly an intrepid musical statement. On For the Season, Frontman/songwriter Greg Ashley seems to acknowledge his own trope, and if he's slapping reverb and heady lyrics on tracks and calling them psych, why not come clean? Whereas their self-titled debut indulged in several lengthy anti-jams before finally locking into incense-laden melodies, For the Season cuts the fat, delivering more focused, tripartite song structures. To minimize rigidity, each track gradually bleeds into the next, segueing with blistering distortion squelches and/or barely audible echolalia. In a sense, For the Season resembles a subtle solidification of its predecessor's spiraling ideas. Ashley no longer hides behind layers of reverb, but rather challenges them with more pristine vocals and warmer instrumentation, often foregoing lysergic mysticism for clean campfire sing-alongs. Both ""Pick Up Your Raygun"" and ""Medicine #4""-- respective spin-offs of earlier songs ""Raygun"" and ""Medicine #3""-- outline the band's fine-tuned songwriting approach. The former shaves down its prototype's protracted kookiness and dives headfirst into rumbling toms and exotic Middle Eastern scales. ""Medicine #4"" sweetens the dusty acoustic strumming of #3, reversing the pop clock almost far enough back to resemble ""Earth Angel"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. Not to worry though psych purists, the Gris Gris aren't about to stray too far from 1967, for better or worse. Much like their first album, For the Season doesn't stir up much in regards to energy or emotion, and nothing's surprising. ""Skin Mass Cat"" and ""Cuerpos Haran Amor Extrano"" accurately rehash smokey van aesthetics to the point of Scooby Doo absurdity, and the title track's faux-sitar riffs practically proselytize on behalf of Buddhism. That said, the Gris Gris's finer attention to detail fills in the cracks where their debut stumbled. Lacking the emotional knack for jaw-dropping singles, the band succeeds in consistently churning out songs that would be solid filler on an amazing album-- a Magical Mystery Tour comprised solely of ""Blue Jay Way""'s.","Latest album cuts the fat from the SF psych-rock band's work, delivering more focused, tripartite song structures.

Father Divine,Mike Ladd,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc665e6ef95969322e36/1:1/w_160/5cc206f3.jpg,2005-11-13 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4625-father-divine/,ROIR,"During the long process of making Father Divine, Mike Ladd got married and became a father (in Paris, no less). You might be tempted to expect a calmer, more reflective Ladd in the wake of fatherhood, but you'd be way off. Father Divine is his grittiest, rawest, furthest-in-the-red album to date, leapfrogging through dub, punk, electro, and soul, all while still rooted in hip-hop. Ladd is notoriously fond of overarching concepts, and he cooked up two for Father Divine: one revolving around the title figure, the founder of the not-quite-a-cult Peace Mission Movement, the other around an attempt to recapture the saturated, dirty sound of the old ROIR punk and dub cassettes, especially that of the self-titled Bad Brains album. The Father Divine thread seems mostly (perhaps mercifully) to have been lost along the way, apart from a mention on the outer space dub track ""So 'N So"", but the second goal is definitely achieved-- as synths buzz, the compression pushes the bass right up into the front of the mix and the album generally crackles with volcanic energy. Ladd has assembled a crack band that draws in players from hip-hop (Antipop Consortium's High Priest on keys), jazz (pianist and frequent collaborator Vijay Iyer), rock (TV on the Radio's Jaleel Bunton on guitar), and dub (Raz Mesinai), among other styles. The diverse musical backgrounds of the players serve Ladd's deconstructionist approach to hip-hop perfectly, as they approach every genre and song they attempt with seat-of-the-pants vitality. Thanks to the band, the album's instrumental tracks are nearly as crucial to the album as the vocal ones, especially ""Crooner Island"", which opens as a stuttering dub cut, slathered in bass and broad synth strokes from French producer Gymkhana, eventually morphing into a pumping shard of Thunderdome electro. Still, the vocal tracks are the focus, and Ladd is fucking righteous on ""Awful Raw"", which swings violently between a repetitive bhangra chorus and blaring swirls of synth. That chorus is addictive, as Ladd doubles himself singing ""Gotta get me channel on/ Gotta get my channel free/ Gotta get my channel on channel channel on"" over tweaked tablas and what might be a Bollywood sample. If there's any palpable result of Ladd's recent life changes, it's most clearly felt in a pair of tracks about women, a subject he's rarely touched upon in the past. ""Barney's Girl"" is a buoyant remembrance of a girl from back in the 80s in Ladd's home of Cambridge, Mass.: ""She was a whole lotta punk and a little hip hop,"" he says, on his breeziest track to date. The other ""girl"" track, ""Murder Girl"", could be prime Prince with Ladd's falsetto chorus and splashy synth hits, channeling His Purpleness in verses broken up by an ominous bit of echoing bass that feels like a reference to Pink Floyd's ""One of These Days"". Like any Ladd album, Father Divine is stuffed with tracks worth talking about, and it's nice to see that Ladd isn't afraid to lay aside his conceptual tendencies in the name of just getting down and nasty, and Father Divine does just that-- it's a record played in the red, and it's not afraid to have a good time there.","On the emcee's grittiest, rawest album to date he leapfrogs through dub, punk, electro, and soul, all while still rooted in hip-hop.

Have you heard Sov's latest 12s? Soft as Baby MC's ace, with beats, rhymes, and life dumbed down for what, Radio 1 and ""Top of the Pops""? Sov's turned (nearly) from splendid young emcee to Young MC on splenda. And yes, I am dissing her ""9-5""; it just ain't her twist. So while Sov haggles in rap vs. pap identity crisis, this Vertically Challenged EP, her first release available stateside, packs all the hard, grimey shit, a comp or even history of sorts of her raggest-taggest jams. ""Random"" has her best bitchslaps, mostly on American rappers, over kicks and bass zoom we'd expect from Timbo-- in 15 years. In other words, Sov's mean schooling us, flipping our scripts and taunting from afar that she, a 19-year-old London hoodrat, does hip-hop better than hip-hop. I just assumed somebody would bark back-- provided they knew she even existed; instead Jay-Z signed her to Island/Def Jam. The why-care of all that won't resonate without knowing Sov's grime scene backstory. There in that fast-paced, viciously insider culture of/for/by Brit-teens boasting neckle but not much else, Sov found a strong chip-on-shoulders identity, however racially/sexually (un)determined. From grime, so far only Dizzee's vibe has come as fully formed. If ""Random"" meant war, ""Ch-Ching,"" her remix of the ""Cheque 1, 2"" garage anthem, first read like personal declaration: ""Me na have 50 rings/ But I got 50 things to say in a cheeky kinda way."" Forty-eight more to go: ""Random"" and ""Ch-Ching"" are two of the best singles of the past couple of years, and Sov recorded boys vs. girls posse cut ""The Battle"" and ""A Little Bit of Shhh!"" before ""Ch-Ching"", so they don't count (though they're great and on here, with meh remix filler too). She has rap knees on their heads-- why jump shark? To be frank I don't know what the fuck's going on here, who Sov's talking to, why she's holding back on us. ""Fiddle With the Volume"", the EP's one new original, beatstanks durty but, sorry, Bryan Adams did the waking up the neighbours thing better, and that's saying something. Right now I'm stuck on one line of ""Shhh!"": ""Here comes the press!!/ Nuva damn reporter/ Obsessed wid my disorder/ Diagnosis please whats wrong wiv her Bill? She's ill."" Give shit interviews, fine, but on wax don't stamp yourself out.

Kicking Television: Live in Chicago,Wilco,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa38b1335d7bf1699622/1:1/w_160/735daff8.gif,2005-11-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8682-kicking-television-live-in-chicago/,Nonesuch,"A live album is, first and foremost, an album: a simulacrum of reality, not the thing itself. Yes, Virginia, studio enhancements are as old as the form, but the presentation extends to which songs are chosen, which banter snippeted, and indeed, even which phase of a performer's career gets chosen for immortalization. This distinction between art and archive is a crucial one for Wilco, as each of the band's albums has represented a progression, or at least a transition-- a unified statement of the group's identity at the moment that it was recorded. Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a 2xCD live album recorded last year in the Second City's Vic Theatre, is no exception. In its 10+ years of existence, Jeff Tweedy's post-Tupelo project has cycled through several lineups and styles: alt-country, Beach Boys-splashed Americana, Radioheaded abstraction. Then, after 2002 masterpiece Yankee Hotel Foxtrot came last year's confusingly lateral move to listener-unfriendly classic-rock, A Ghost Is Born; ""I will turn on you,"" Tweedy sang in ""I'm a Wheel"". The tables turn again with Kicking Television, which casts its predecessor's songs in hotter light and serves as a coming-out party for Wilco's newest, six-member incarnation: a drinking man's avant-jam band. Where I work, ""continuous improvement"" is part of the mission statement, and hey it's apparent in Tweedy's guitar soloing, as well. Both he and Nels Cline torture their six-strings as if the Vic were a covert U.S. detainee camp in Eastern Europe: piercing the infernal night in ""Hell Is Chrome"", cavorting Grateful Deadward on ""Handshake Drugs"", and sprawling across the dark center of the universe over the Neu!-like drone of ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"", which reinvigorates the studio version and is the release's crowning achievement. So this is what A Ghost Is Born is supposed to sound like. Indeed, the tracklisting is heavy on Wilco's latest studio effort, for better and worse. ""Hummingbird"" is where the shelved DVD version of the album would come in handy, as the song's straightforward ""Penny Lane"" piano allows Tweedy to go guitarless for once. ""The Late Greats"", which sounded like a jangly obscurantist afterthought at the end of A Ghost Is Born, could probably have been trimmed here, as well. ""At Least That's What You Said"" opens with hushed electric guitar, rather than moody piano, then crashes into a jagged mountainside of swirling guitar noise in its massive breakdown. The punky title track, however, an A Ghost Is Born castoff with washer-and-dryer guitars, is a letdown even if it allows Tweedy to utter, ""I'm serious/ I've been working on my abs."" Though the band loosens up the new songs, the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot numbers remain consistent with previous live renditions-- that is, still awesome. Tweedy's clenched voice is consumes by noise on ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", xylophones ever-tinkling. ""Let's get this party started...with some midtempo rock,"" he jokes, then fulfills his pledge with ""Jesus, Etc."", slide guitar replacing violins on the chorus and the verses sprinkled with reggae-tinged synths. He tries humor again leading into ""I Am the Man Who Loves You"", announcing, ""This is my favorite part of the show: I love you!"" before unleashing an erection of guitar noise and a porno-funk intro to an uptempo performance with bright Sgt. Pepper's horns. Faithful renditions of ""Radio Cure"", ""Ashes of American Flags"", ""Poor Places"", and poppy ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" round out the second disc. Wilco's Nonesuch albums get preference here, but earlier highlights appear, as well. Summerteeth murder ballad ""Via Chicago"" elicits a slow surge of that's-us-dude applause. From the same album, ""A Shot in the Arm"" is always welcome, its straining pop grandiosity hinting at the classic record to follow. Mermaid Ave. Vol. II's ""Airline to Heaven"" is a live favorite for its pastoral stomp, as is Vol. I's sleepy ""One by One"". There's also a farewell singalong cover of ""Comment (If All Men Are Truly Brothers)"", originally by 70s funk figure Charles Wright. Press clippings indicate that Tweedy's laconic stage presence has grown more easygoing, but the banter here is mostly as ho-hum as my earlier examples. ""How dignified is it to come from Kansas City to Chicago to see Wilco?"" Tweedy muses at one point. Of course, the truly important part of this presentation is the music, and there Wilco rarely disappoints. On the first track, Being There opener ""Misunderstood"", with a jubilant crowd singing along, Tweedy's dry-paper voice rasps a few magic words-- ""Do you still love rock 'n' roll?""-- and thanks us all for ""nothing/ nothing/ nothing/ nothing/ nothing.""","This 2xCD live album finds the now six-piece band improving on the tracks from A Ghost Is Born, as well as offering a number of old favorites.

Impulsive!,Various Artists,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85ab1335d7bf169926d/1:1/w_160/78f7ec08.jpg,2005-11-10 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2104-impulsive/,Impulse!,"Impulse! Records had been defunct for more than a quarter century. It's back now, resurrected by Verve as a reissue hearth and a home for legacy acts like Alice Coltrane. It's a shell of the free jazz behemoth it used to be. More like a vanity project really, for compilations like this, with remixes from nouveau-chic producers and beatsmiths. Reverential stuff, to be sure, but it's all sort of one-note. Which is the opposite of its original incarnation actually, a place where Pharoah Sanders and Albert Ayler and most famously John Coltrane recorded abstract, crunching jazz music. Impulsive! now exists as a way for avant glitch-hop Derrida-jackers like Prefuse 73 to pay homage. Which is fine. It should be paid. Only problem is there's no improving, or even expanding on something like Mingus' ""II B.S."" It's seminal, flittering around that stiff-loose bass line. Some people use the word ""groove"" improperly. ""II B.S."" still grooooooves. One of the biggest coups on Impulsive is the presence of RZA dropping his remix/re-imagining/re-clunking of ""II B.S."" A nice sentiment from a guy who knows a bit about flittering bass lines, but it's inconsistent and awkwardly chopped up. Remixing a song like ""II B.S."" is dangerous enough; rushing through it is unfortunate. Sa-Ra Creative Partners take George Russell and his darting horns on ""A Helluva Town"" and make them sound more like Arthur Russell on crank. There's a blitzkrieg going on with the busybody double-time drums and it's easy to take at first. They've at least made it a new song, keeping the original sense of structure. But it's still just a deconstructionist rip-off. There's successful stuff here, too. Germany's Boozoo Bajou lets Sandersâ startlingly pretty ""Astral Traveling"" breathe a bit under some island rhythms before taking it out to the park and dancing all over the melody with overpowering percussion. DJ Dolores inherits the freewheeling grace of Chico O'Farrill and Clark Terry's ""Spanish Rice"" and gives it a glide-then-stomp rhythm. It's incredible sidewalk music. As in, ""Move I have the street power."" Prefuse does a pretty good job with Gabor Szabo's ""Mizrab"", one of the few guitar-based songs on the comp. By the time Scott Herren's done with it though, it resembles what Surrounded by Silence needed to sound like: tuneful with squealing overtones, not vice versa. Blackalicious' Chief XCel and Kid Koala drop veneration, too, making what amounts to the exact remix you'd expect from these two, highlighted by the power of its drum sound. Rather than the pacesetter they act as on Archie Shepp's ""Attica Blues"", XCel bumps the drums way up, skittering the pounding everywhichwaybutloose. Koala works in the opposite vein on ""Bamboo Flute Blues"", splicing and looping endlessly, using that unmistakable turntable wobble he's known for. Except it makes me want to hear Kid Koala, not Yusef Lateef, which defeats the purpose, we think. All said, Impulsive! takes the worn-out remix philosophy that damn near killed Motown and The Isley Brothers for me, and flips jazz records, some classic, and some lesser known. I fully expect some chucklehead to try to rework A Love Supreme or Mingus Ah Um soon. That is when I will declare war.","Verve resurrects Impulse!

The Remixes,Grizzly Bear,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c01413d197565213b9c3/1:1/w_160/d71a1782.jpg,2005-11-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3667-the-remixes/,Kanine,"It's practically a Brooklyn fairy tale: Sensitive dude makes hushed, lo-fi folk-pop in his Greenpoint bedroom after hearing just enough Iron & Wine. Dude has talented, arty friend who adds just enough arboreal, backwards-reverbed oddness to draw comparisons to the latest local avant-garde ""scene"" (other than noise, of course). The hirsute and horn-rimmed hordes rejoice; dudes reissue debut album with a disc of snazzy remixes by all their cool neighbors, plus some non-locals. Crotchety Pitchfork critic makes gratuitous opening Brooklyn references, claps hands, says ""dude"" too much. Much of Horn of Plenty's sheepish beauty lay in Christopher Bear's eccentric blurrings of Edward Droste's naturally melodic, one-microphone campfire koans. At times The Remixes sharpens the focus on Droste's songwriting, which was often submerged in Bear's abyssal touches; Safety Scissors, for instance, accelerate the syrup-sopped ""La Duchesse Anne"", add buzzing, intermittently shuffling beats, and expose a catchy ""do-do-do"" leftfield pop gem. Simon Bookish makes the most immediately satisfying turn, adding a goofy new verse about ""London Calling"" and file-sharing to a clatteringly optimistic take on the wounded ""Eavesdropping"". Still other tracks-- such as Son's fuzzy ""Shift"" or Circlesquare's coruscating expansion of the same song (whistle-choir front and center, natch)-- serve to further abstract the originals. Either way, The Remixes serves as a revelatory set of reinventions, while not a song-for-song do-over like Bloc Party's latest thingy. Listeners old and new are likely to find remixes they'll prefer over their forebears: not just Bookish's ""Eavesdropping"", but also Final Fantasy's ""Don't Ask"", which takes one of Horn of Plenty's most conventional tracks and dresses it up in strings and snug melodrama. Soft Pink Truth takes ""A Good Place"" all over the damn place-- underwater vox, ""Slave 4 U"" stripclub rhythms, meowing pet-store horn samples-- while concentrating on the song's evocative ""blow by blow"" lyric. And get me Jimmy Tamborello: Dntel does ""Merge"" as pulsing, wistful ""Chariots of Fur"" laptronica. Efterklang's opening ""Campfire"" rattles the halls of Rivendell with triumphant woodwinds that neuter the orig by comparison. Helps, too, that so many of the artists featured aren't among remixing's usual suspects. First-time second-mixers Ariel Pink offer a droning, crackly ""Disappearing Act"", like ""Our Prayer"" Brian Wilson collaborating with Syd Barrett and then vanishing like the drum fills amid reverent, one-chord acoustic strums. Castanets apparently took ""Deep Sea Diver"" literally, plunging into three minutes of groaning, rippling guitar noise-- The Life Subaquatic! As in real fairy tales, freak-folk's emperors are sometimes accused of lacking clothes; Grizzly Bear's songs beguile however they're adorned.","Remix disc added to the Kanine band's debut LP features contributions from Dntel, Soft Pink Truth, and Ariel Pink, among others.

Qvaris,No-Neck Blues Band,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41513d197565213be91/1:1/w_160/2b3971b2.jpg,2005-11-10 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5818-qvaris/,5RC,"For more than a dozen years, Harlem-based ensemble No-Neck Blues Band have been issuing their inscrutable ripples across the face of the prevailing underground currents. And although the majority of the group's performances have occurred within the confines of the Hint House, their communal headquarters, echoes of their earthy, protean sprawl can be easily detected in the work of such contemporaries as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, and the MV & EE Medicine Show, as can their policies of utilizing non-traditional venues and maintaining an inclusive membership. So too have No Neck (or NNCK) long been pioneers in the now-fashionable art of the unwieldy discography, as they've left an extensive and virtually untraceable trail of glorious, privately-pressed recordings in their wake. With the relatively high-profile release of the potent Qvaris, however, perhaps the time has come for the always-secretive group to allow a hint of revealing light to penetrate their fragrant, self-generated smokescreens. As with much of their recent work, Qvaris was again recorded at Hint House, and is at the very least the collective's most refined and convincing statement since their epic 2001 Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones on John Fahey's Revenant label. Obliquely informed by the supernatural texts of such early 20th century authors as H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood, and Lord Dunsany, Qvaris is a shadowy hymn to imminent oblivion, with NNCK's familiar post-tribal landscapes coursing with some of their heaviest, most resolutely rock-centric streams to date. The album cracks open with the Sunburned-like, backwoods rumble of ""The Doon"", a title that Dunsany might've translated to mean ""The End"", before the choogle of ""Live Your Myth in Grease"" continues the ceremony with its burnished, intertwined guitar figures. From there the album quickly turns to directly address the void with ""The Black Pope"", a swirling eddy of spookhouse keyboards, scraped strings and unmoored spirits. Awaiting at the far end of this wormhole are the locomotive likes of ""Boreal Gluts"", a supercharged, Beefheartian tussle, and later the lyrical ""Lugnagall"", which carries a pure whiff of Avalon Ballroom psych on its tradewinds of guitar, organ, and far-off vocal ecstasies. Interspersed among these lengthier tracks are four distinct variations of the ""Qvaris Theme"", a quirky little tune first introduced with chirping keys and rattling hand percussion. By album's end, even this modest piece has expanded into the fractured electronics of ""Vaticon Blue (Theme End)"", a placid throb that sounds as if it might've strayed over from John Fell Ryan's NNCK spin-off, Excepter. The album's sole misstep-- and no NNCK album could be considered complete without one-- is ""The Caterpillar Heart,"" a quietly tinkling 11-minute sequence of silverware percussion and miniature nibbling teeth that stands in unflattering contrast to many of the record's bolder movements. This overlong departure aside, Qvaris showcases its self-assured cast of veteran outlaws and wayfarers seamlessly conjoined in tireless pursuit of their unnameable quarry, and you'd do well to spend some quality hours awaiting oblivion in its presence.","5RC issues the prolific collective's most refined and convincing statement since the 2001 epic Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones.

At This Time,Burt Bacharach,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a1b1335d7bf16989e8/1:1/w_160/3f4de886.jpg,2005-11-10 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1183-at-this-time/,Columbia,"After nearly six decades in the music business, At This Time is the first album Burt Bacharach has written lyrics for, without the guiding collaborative input of, say, Hal David or Elvis Costello. Normally, Bacharach's the go-to guy for melodies and arrangements: Ever since his days in the famed Brill Building-- where pop music was a suit-and-tie profession-- he's been known for composing supple and sophisticated music that elevates familiar sentiments. Over the years he developed a sheen of affectionate kitsch that has nevertheless made him an unironic hero to younger generations. So, with Bacharach writing the songs, theoretically At This Time should be a major statement, especially given its inspiration: Worried over the state of the nation, Bacharach addresses an unjustified war, a treacherous administration, and society's ingrained potential for violence, trying to sound hopeful despite his worst fears. But real insight is scarce on At This Time, as are lyrics of any kind. To be touted as his first lyrical effort, this is nearly an instrumental album, with full emphasis on lite-jazz orchestration and poignant arrangements. Over largely anonymous loops and beats from Dr. Dre and Prinz Board, Bacharach crafts miniature soundtracks like ""Dreams"" and ""In Our Time"", with flourishes of trumpet (courtesy of Chris Botti), bland saxophone, and garishly canned strings. The mood is inquisitive and subdued, but there's no variation across these 11 tracks. A little righteous anger might have added a little spark more than a few of these songs. ""Who Are These People?"" brings in dramatic horns, pounding tympani, and a howling Elvis Costello, but the result is closer to show tune than protest song. Bacharach's arrangements dominate At This Time so heavily that when the vocals come in, you listen all the more closely-- which is not such a great idea. Bacharach's lyrics rely on flimsy bromides and rhetorical questions, which range from startlingly direct (""Who Are These People?"") to head-scratchingly vague: ""The sun and the moon are crying/ The stars and our hearts, crying,"" Bacharach sings on ""Please Explain"", which really does demand some sort of explanation. Bacharach seems a little flummoxed by his subject matter. He's angry at the state of the world, but only in the most general terms, which means that At This Time could be adopted by liberals angry at Bush or conservatives angry at wartime dissenters. I'll give Bacharach the benefit of the doubt, though: his overgenerality never feels commercially calculated to move more units to a broader audience. On ""Where Did It Go?"" he claims he's worried about riding the New York subways, and remembers when he was a kid, he could ride the subways ""and never, ever be afraid."" This seems like a relatively small problem these days, one more suitable to the 1970s. Bacharach's much more convincing talking about his children and wondering what their futures will hold; the concrete specificity (he even tells us their ages) of this act of paternal protectiveness contains the album's heart, and it's the only time Bacharach sounds directly engaged. It's affecting, albeit only briefly so. Aside from ""Where Did It Go?"", Bacharach provides vocals on only a few songs. His voice proves surprisingly calming-- a little quieter and quivery with the years, but still smooth, strong, and sober. Unfortunately, he relinquishes the bulk of the vocal duties to what he calls a ""Greek chorus"" of backing singers. Sounding overly professional, they lack the personality to put these songs and their intended messages across. Only Rufus Wainwright, who sings ""Go Ask Shakespeare"", invests his part with any energy, in the process redeeming the saccharine lyrics. Overall, At This Time sounds strangely disconnected from our time. It has the straitlaced edge of Bacharach's 60s material, but without any of the charm. Instead, the album feels like it comes from someone at arm's length from the world, for whom celebrity has made the world's real problems merely abstract. At This Time sounds more inspired by upsetting headlines and sensational news reports than real experience. There may be real anger, disappointment, and frustration behind these songs, but you'd be hard-pressed to hear it.","The veteran songwriter addresses an unjustified war, a treacherous administration, and society's ingrained potential for violence-- with help from Dr. Dre.

Down in Albion,Babyshambles,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a0c0084474cd0c0524/1:1/w_160/599e2701.jpg,2005-11-10 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1182-down-in-albion/,Rough Trade,"No dead baby jokes about Pete Doherty's so-called shambles; no talk of coke-habits and skin-and-bones supermodel girlfriends (except as back-up vocalists): Down in Albion is the opposite of Up the Bracket, and not just for prepositional reasons. Departing from the Libertines' work by slowing-down, shaping-up, Down in Albion doesn't out-do Up the Bracket's gritty unruliness (and the less said about the self-titled follow-up the better), but doesn't flop as self-indulgently/destructively as it could, either Doherty appropriates William Blake's Albion here; his motifs are death, drugs, fucking. Oasis once intoned immortality-- ""You and I are gonna live forever""-- but ""Fuck Forever""'s the mid-90s anthem's morbid antithesis, death and glory's fuzzy meridian. The second of 16 tracks, Doherty's ""fuck forever, if you don't mind"" should've usurped the inane ""La Belle et la bete"" (featuring the vocal stylings of Kate Moss-- la bete?) as Albion's enthroned first-song, flipping off ""Live Forever""'s na\x95ve cheer. Even if Doherty's an asshole for saying so, someone had to: ""Now is not the time to cry"" for some guys, but when life's lousy-- fuck it, kick shit over, send it flying, cry your eyes out. Coming across as shambolic and rough'n'tumble can be both a blessing and a curse; here, it's blessing first: If ""Fuck Forever""'s meant as counterpoint to ""Live Forever,"" most of the album's other songs are doubles, scruffily reinterpreted. ""Back from the Dead"" is ""Lust for Life"" weary from having come full-circle and gotten its wish; ""What Katy Did Next"" is a revamped ""Wishin' and Hopin'"" (""So if you're thinkin' of havin' true lovin'/ All you've gotta do is hold him and kiss him/ And squeeze him and love him/ Do it, and after you do you will be his"") meant for you-know-who. The catchier stuff retrofits 60s acts, while ""The 32 of December"", ""Killamangiro"", and ""8 Dead Boys"" are looser, weirder Clash and Pistols. So when Babyshambles try pulling shit like ""Pipe Down""-- a crappy ""Fuck Forever"" for kids still missing Kurt Cobain-- swagger uninspired through ""Up the Morning"", misstep with from-nowhere reggae stunts ""Sticks and Stones"" and ""Pentonville"", the whole precariously fragile mess is busted and broken. In parts, Albion's shambolism is stunning, but that's no excuse for moments of total sloppiness. Production's tidied to a fault; vocals stray too often-- perfect in doses, exasperating otherwise. Cut shorter, Down in Albion could've topped Up the Bracket, with its fed-up rock star-cum-zombie-isms-- feelings we commoners know better. As it stands, Down in Albion's charm lies mostly in its tenuousness and tightrope-walking; an unfussy love coming in spurts.","First post-Libertines album for UK tabloid fixture Pete Doherty dodges self-indulgent, destructive tendencies, coming across instead like a slowed-down, shaped-up Up the Bracket.

Lick on the Tip of an Envelope That's Yet to Be Sent,Circulus,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a749b1335d7bf1699009/1:1/w_160/3b5ba3e5.gif,2005-11-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1822-lick-on-the-tip-of-an-envelope-thats-yet-to-be-sent/,Candlelight,"I've been had. The moment the first strains of the first song off Lick of the Tip issued from the speakers, I flashed forward to a later track, the name of which had already made me grin without hearing it-- ""Power to the Pixies"". Circulus, their debut album's weirdly suggestive title aside, are the kind of band who will sing about transfering actual power to actual pixies. You just made me listen to a medieval folk-revivalist record. We're talking tights. We're talking woolen dresses. We're talking capes and floppy hats and all the Society for the Creative Anachronism accoutrements that, glimpsed across the Diag lawn, used to make even the mild-mannered me feel the stirrings of a bully inside. We're talking a ""Britain's foremost medieval-influenced progressive psychedelic folk band,"" per recent befuddled profile in The Guardian. In all fairness, the songs on Lick are not strict interpretations of Elizabethan music-- in fact, Circulus like to see themselves as hip pariahs in the stuffy world of what they call ""lute mafia."" While they retain basic features of medieval folk-- the structures, the melodies, the now-novel plaintive intervals between the lead and backing vocals-- they also slather the record with signifiers of psychedelia. Squelchy synth lines compete with flutes for the high frequencies, and the low end is certainly more muscular than anything normally heard around a maypole. Circulus are not even above a wailing pentatonic guitar solo or two. The album gets going, via ""Miri It Is"", with a classic fakeout-- a Middle Earth chant suddenly sprouts an angry beat, over which grows a layer of ELO-style organ wanking. The disorientation is dizzying and not entirely unpleasant. There is, however, a glue that holds all this fiddle-faddle together and gives it a certain inner logic. Although it remains unacknowledged directly, that glue is, of course, drugs, and plenty of them. Whatever the reason, stoner music is forever dancing around a miniature Stonehenge, and Circulus's hybrids are technically no weirder than the usual Celticisms of the heavy metal parking lot. So it makes total sense that Circulus are signed to Rise Above, a doom-metal label, and marketed with a bit of a snicker (ask yourself how the hell did the album wind up at Pitchfork). The only thing I fail to peg is the band's own attitude toward their schtick. Are they more Napalm Death or Goblin Cock, so to speak? They do play it relatively straight, and there's nothing overtly campy about Lick. At the same time, Circulus are known to book hipster loft parties and rock them in full regalia, feigning obliviousness to the nature of their freak appeal. Something about this is upsetting in a very elemental way. Is it still a joke when its butt is absolutely every party involved?","Medieval folk structures and melodies slathered with signifiers of psychedelia.

Cinder,Dirty Three,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99ceb335119a49ec811/1:1/w_160/ab7d66e3.jpg,2005-11-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2332-cinder/,Touch and Go,"Everybody likes one Dirty Three album but nobody likes all of them, and your favorite is probably the record you heard first; this fine and original band engenders an odd sort of fanship fatigue. For a while it seemed as though the records sounded too much alike, but Dirty Three found ways to change up the sound through multi-tracking and shift of focus, so that's not quite it. The weariness has I think more to do with the inherent drama and love of dynamics in the trio's approach to their respective instruments. You think violin, guitar, and drums, and you figure there's something in there that might work as background music, but Dirty Three albums ask a lot. With their inevitable crescendos, every song eventually butts its way into whatever you're doing. You're either paying close attention or you're listening to something else. On Cinder, Dirty Three seem ready to pare back and let the songs inhabit comparatively modest worlds. Most of these 19 tracks are relatively short mood sketches that will likely be pushed in grander direction in a live setting. There's a bit more instrumental variety, too, with Warren Ellis adding mandolin and piano to some tracks, and Mick Turner contributing bass and organ. ""Doris"" surprises by beginning with huge drums (turns out Jim White knows how to play a straight backbeat) and angular, almost funky guitar, before reaching a moment of jubilation with a jagged blast of bagpipes from guest Mark Saul. ""The Zither Player"" is an extrapolation of a theme by Hungarian fiddle player Félix Lajkó, and its jittery upbeat rhythm and Gypsy melody is unusually danceable for the D3. On the other end of the spectrum are quiet set pieces like ""Ever Since"" and ""Amy"", on which restrained playing by Ellis allows the simple beauty of trio's group interplay to gel. Another first: Cinder has vocals. ""Great Waves"" has Dirty Three backing Chan Marshall to lovely effect; as with her 1998 record Moon Pix, Marshall's hushed ethereal leanings sound particularly convincing stitched up in the rhythms of Turner and White. And she remembered to bring her newly sharpened sense of melody. Sally Timms' wordless cooing on the shapeless ""Feral"", on the other hand, is far less satisfying, bordering on pointless. Still, on their seventh album, any expansion in approach is welcome, and even the excesses of traditional D3 builders like ""She Passed Through"" are easy to swallow. If much of it is merely pretty, this is easily the most diverse and wide-ranging Dirty Three record yet, absolutely the right thing for them to be doing at this time. It doesn't ask for or promise nearly as much, which is just the breather needed.","On their seventh album, the moody trio drafts in vocal contributions from Cat Power and Sally Timms.

Their debut album, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables was originally released in 1980 on the UK label Cherry Red, and has since been re-released by several other labels, including IRS, Alternative Tentacles, and Cleopatra. The newest reissue-- the special 25th anniversary edition-- features the original artwork and a bonus 55-minute DVD documenting the making of the album as well as the band's early years. The packaging here is fantastic: The once grainy, indistinguishable burning police cars that don the cover now appear in much sharper detail. For the original pressing, the band requested the flames look orange, and as a result, the entire cover was printed orange on white. After that pressing, strict black and white was used, and most versions looked like something produced on a gas station copy machine. The tri-fold digipak offers a pull-out replica of the original collage/lyric sheet, featuring newspaper clippings, advertisements, and political diatribes all infused with the bands usual biting sarcasm and bizarre humor. Ronald Reagan grins out at you despite his drawn-in Hitler mustache and the fact that someone has written ""sex"" all over his face. The label from a can of salmon with Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle pasted over it sits above a marching line of breakfast foods. You could spend an hour looking over the double-sided poster and still miss things. Unfortunately, there are no bonus tracks. The original 14 songs are here; the album is still barely over a half-hour long. It is remastered, but considering that this is a 25-year-old debut recording by a punk rock band, don't expect it to suddenly sound impeccable. It is what it is, and the group's amateurism showed more on this record than on subsequent ones. Even some of the songs fall prey to the band's younger, less focused outlook. ""Kill the Poor"", the album opener, is fun to sing along with, but at its heart it's a generic rock song hiding behind satirical lyrics and low-fi production. The final track is the ill-conceived cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"", which seems tame after the 13 originals that precede it. There are several classic DK tracks here though, most notably ""California Über Alles"" and ""Holiday in Cambodia"", both of which still sound powerful and fresh. The opening bass notes of ""Holiday in Cambodia"" are some of the most sinister sounds punk rock ever produced. Of the lesser-known tracks, ""Drug Me"" is one of the band's faster songs, and it strongly hinted at where the band would head with their next EP. ""When Ya Get Drafted"", ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"", and ""Your Emotions"" all show off the group's ability to blend upbeat, light-hearted music with sinister satirical lyrics. Over the years, the Dead Kennedys' lyrics and vocals have recieved the most attention. Jello Biafra's over-the-top warble is instantly recognizable, and no one used sick and twisted humor to deliver such serious messages-- many are still applicable today -- with the same level of skill. ""Chemical Warfare"" predicts bio-terrorism that hits too close to home, or perhaps I should say too close to the country club. ""Holiday in Cambodia"" mocks the poor little rich kid who thinks he's got it bad with lines like, ""You'll work harder with a gun in your back/ For a bowl of rice a day."" The bonus DVD offers little for the serious fan, mostly interviews with East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, a couple of radio DJs, and other people connected with the band in its early days. Little attention is paid to the actual creation of the album; most of the interviewees just find various ways to talk about how great it is. Included are six live performances, all filmed with the original line-up. Most of the footage here has been widely available, either on the Dead Kennedys: The Early Years Live DVD, or on various VHS tapes throughout the years. But these early performances are interesting if you've never seen Biafra's bizarre pantomime-style antics (or his obsession with green plastic gloves), but some clips just go to prove that watching any band try to entertain 20 or 30 people who seem completely uninterested can be painful-- even if the band went on to become legendary.","Reissue of the debut LP from Jello Biafra's agit-punk group.

Aerial,Kate Bush,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49f13d1975652138d57/1:1/w_160/7538b3d2.jpg,2005-11-09 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1181-aerial/,Columbia,"Non-shocker: I was disappointed the first few times I listened to Kate Bush's first new record in 12 years. Having spent some time recently wondering if the woman responsible for so much haunted, supernatural music might be producing some beacon of artistic integrity that would shine through layers of anticipation and cynicism, it was difficult to not be let down by the mundane discovery that, in fact, she's merely being herself here, writing more about everyday epiphanies than great cosmic truths. It's a pretty Zen lesson in expectation when I think about it, teaching me a thing or two about the pitfalls of hanging onto anything other than gradual enlightenment and a zero-sum world. Aerial, a double album separated into chapters of A Sea of Honey and A Sky of Honey, is Bush's answer to a world outside expecting fireworks. That is, Aerial is no answer at all except to illuminate her love for her son, her life, and various distractions (everything from Elvis, to the joy of washing clothes, to the digits in pi). Musically, this is reflected in a uniformly low-key backdrop of piano, pastel rhythm section, and, of course, her own lush palette of vocal textures. Initially, many of the songs seem muted, passive, dated-- hardly reminiscent of Bush's previous adventures in hi-fi. Digging deeper, while the arrangements are hardly explosive-- a Renaissance string arrangement for ""Bertie"", birdsong in ""Aerial Tal"", subtle electronic touches in ""Joanni""-- they're not so much dated as understated, as efficiently tied to their creator's idiosyncrasies as any in Bush's canon. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean they will leap out and grab unconverted listeners as the best moments on Hounds of Love or The Dreaming did, but then I wonder how many unconverted listeners are still following Bush's sensual trail these days. Aerial's first disc (A Sea of Honey) begins in nondescript fashion with a torch song to Elvis (!) and a molasses-laden backing of big fat 80s rock drums, wispy synth cluster, electronic gamelan ping, and the driest rhythm guitar skank I've heard in 20 years. Still, there's a mysterious air about the song, especially as Bush cries, ""the wind is whistling, the wind is whistling through the house."" This song was chosen as a single, for what reasons I can't really imagine, but is a nice setup for the more interesting character study of the man with the ""obsessive nature and deep fascination for numbers"" on ""Π"". In fact, it's Bush's reading off the digits of the number that most interest me, stretching out some, crowding others into rapidly sung groups, all with some of the most expressive singing on the record. Likewise, on the piano-led ballad ""Mrs. Bartoluzzi"", she manages to sound fascinating while simply repeating the phrase ""washing machine,"" and backing herself with superficially silly things like ""slooshy sloshy, slooshy sloshy."" I can't say I'm as taken with ""Bertie"" (about Bush's son) or ""Joanni"" (for Joan of Arc), both of which seem totally sincere, but overrun in pleasant, ""tasteful"" arrangements that never quite compel me enough to go back for repeated listens. The second disc (A Sky of Honey) seems a bit more adventurous, which is fitting given that it's a song-cycle on the natural ebb and flow of life and the seasons. Beginning with a ""Prelude"" and ""Prologue"", Bush eases into her most subtly symphonic music on record, backing herself with only piano and soft, modulating synth pulse. Her teasing lines, ""it's gonna be so good,"" referring to the passing of summer into fall, are both poetic and playful, and fit perfectly the sense of effortless euphoria throughout the disc. Still, I might have wished for a bit more spark: ""An Architect's Dream"", ""Sunset"", and ""Nocturn"", despite maintaining the narrative of her concept, are a bit too steeped in uber-light adult contemporary sheen for my tastes. By the time of the closing title track, my ears are lightly glazed over, and its frail ""rock"" section does little justice to lines like ""I want to be up on the roof, I feel I gotta get up on the roof!"" At one point, Bush trades cackles with a bird's song, suggesting she's quite happy with her simple life as a mother and artist. Far be it from me to criticize happy endings, but in musical terms, a comfortable, even-keeled existence sometimes comes out as isolated and ordinary art.","Legendary singer's first new LP in 12 years is a 2xCD record that illuminating her love for her son, her life, and everything from Elvis to the joy of washing clothes to the digits in pi-- all backed by suitably low-key backdrop of piano, a pastel rhythm section, and her own lush pallet of vocal textures.

Concentration Face / Homeboy,Hella,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1485e6ef95969323699/1:1/w_160/f40dee31.gif,2005-11-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11758-concentration-facehomeboy/,5RC,"You can say one thing for Hella's Zach Hill and Spencer Heim: They're all about abundance. Just months after their generous two-disc set Church Gone Wild/ Chirpin' Hard, the duo have dropped yet another mammoth package on your doorstep: Concentration Face, the group's first live DVD, which contains a whopping three hours of footage from Hella's 2004 Japanese tour, as well as the Homeboy EP, which features four new blasts of the duo's distinctive spazz-rock mayhem. Directed by Ryan Walker Thomas, the Concentration Face DVD is divided roughly into two halves: The first is a standard, closely-edited tour film following Hella from city to city; the second presents a complete live set recorded in Tokyo. Both halves are packed with the duo's explosive instrumental music, and feature remarkably little in the way of stage banter or dialogue. As such, the collection makes no effort to introduce either of the two musicians as personalities, instead focusing resolutely on capturing Hella's fierce live show, a choice that seems rather debatable given the duo's static, minimal stage production. On record Hella have grown increasingly reliant on Nintendo-inspired electronic textures, but here they spend the bulk of their time in full metallic shredder mode, facing each other down like a couple of long-lost, hyper-adrenalized Van Halen brothers, while their attentive Japanese audiences stand and vibrate politely. For casual fans, the first half of Concentration Face will prove to be the more compelling, as it intersperses this live concert footage with a montage of Japanese city scenes, train rides, and children's television shows. The band also unselfishly includes excerpts from the sets of supporting acts like Ari Morimoto and M.A.G.O., some of whom prove intriguing enough to nearly upstage the headliner. Throughout the disc, one can't help but marvel at Hella's insane chops, and the relentless ferocity of drummer Hill in particular. It's obviously music of extreme physical demands, a point emphasized by a segment that depicts a sweat-drenched Hill examining his kit after a show, looking as though he and the entire area had just been soaked with a firehose. After more than an hour of such footage, however, the concert that comprises the DVD's second half might seem a tad redundant. Drawing heavily from 2002's Hold Your Horse Is, Hella pummel the likes of ""Cafeteria Bananas"" and ""Biblical Violence"", their sound a repetitive, delirious blur of finger-tapped fretboards and stampeding hoofbeats. Essentially presented as a real-time event, for some reason they've gone so far as to even retain several lengthy pauses between songs while the duo quietly tinker with their equipment, an inclusion that does little to relieve the set's advancing monotony. Such is Concentration Face's bountiful overkill that the 29-minute, four song Homeboy seems positively miniature in comparison. Roiling opener ""Gothspel For You Not Them"" is one continuous discordant crescendo, while the choppy ""Madonna Approaches R&B; Blonde Wreckages"" adds loopy keyboard tones for a brief swirl of Playstation-prog. The short set closes with the perfectly titled ""If I Were in Hella I Would Eat Lick"", a track of ridiculous density that, as with the best moments on Concentration Face, reveals Hill and Seim's almost telepathic interplay, an intense connection that can make them seem oblivious to the presence of an audience. And as Homeboy illustrates, the twosome might just be at their most effective when, for once, they're able to exercise a little portion control.","You can say one thing for Hella's Zach Hill and Spencer Heim: They're all about abundance.

John Peel: A Tribute,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a859b1335d7bf169926a/1:1/w_160/c9bcecaa.jpg,2005-11-08 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2103-john-peel-a-tribute/,WSM,"Since you're reading Pitchfork, I assume you have an idea of who the late, great John Peel was. And if you know who Peel is, you also know that as a ""tribute to John Peel"", this two-disc set is kind of wanting. Maybe if they had titled it A Hipster-Approved Guide to John Peel I'd be more sympathetic. Because Peel was as famous for his ""bad"" taste as his ""good."" Yes, he loved Joy Division, made a cause out of the Fall, and recorded a session for nearly every indie rock band of note during his too-short time on this earth. But when in doubt, Peel would play a happy hardcore record-- and not ironically. Peel was infamous as the man who took grindcore to the masses, when it was still just a bunch of spotty teenagers showing off for their friends in a northern pub. And he loved it not only for the humor inherent in seconds-long songs like Napalm Death's ""You Suffer"", but because it seemed like a direct extension of his love for punk rock. He tried to bring acid house to his listeners when they were otherwise getting a steady diet of the Wedding Present. (He tried to do the same a few years later with jungle when his audience preferred Britpop.) He was once asked by critic David Stubbs which he preferred, Joy Division or the shambling Bogshed-- a band arguably no one but Peel listeners remember-- and he replied ""Bogshed."" And he wasn't kidding. Even up to the end, he was giving equal time in his famous sessions to Soundmurderer, the Bug, and Hot Snakes. As music, of course, you can't fault this record. (That's what happens when you get to cherry-pick the best records from a four-decade broadcasting career.) And though it does flag a little bit by the end-- sorry Delgados, you were no Jimi Hendrix, don't feel too bad about it-- there are only a handful of songs that are less than great. Arranged more or less chronologically, you can almost imagine parents and their disaffected teenagers bonding over it, Dad and daughter swapping Faces for Super Furry Animals. It'd be a veritable fucking WB moment. Peel got his start on pirate radio in the 1960s, and that's where the collection begins as well. A goodly chunk of the first disc is straight off of classic rock radio. David Bowie's ""Life on Mars?"" and the Doors' ""Five to One"" jostle for space with non-King Biscuit Flour Hour staples like Captain Beefheart's still jaw-dropping ""Big Eyed Beans From Venus"" (""Mr. Zoot Horn Rollo, hit that long, lunar note"") and T.Rex's ""Debora"" (watch the scales fall from the eyes of the young Devendra fan in your life). Try not to choke up a little bit during Tim Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"". Punk is represented by sprinkling of Big Names like the Clash and (of course) Joy Div. Peel's fave song of all time, the Undertones' ""Teenage Kicks"", kicks off the second disc. This one comes off more like the March of Britpop (Slight Return), stretching from the Smiths to Pulp, taking in both the populist (Blur's ""Song 2"") and anti-populist (Billy Bragg's surprisingly enjoyable ""A New England""). Peel's deep, abiding love for all forms of Jamaican music is reduced to one song, Culture's ""Lionrock"". Likewise, apparently Orbital's ""Chime"" is our representative electronic dance record. This is not to say the disc isn't rotten with good music-- reinsert my comments Re:Tim Buckley for Robert Wyatt's ""Shipbuilding""-- it's just a little...uniform. Maybe a disc where Extreme Noise Terror was butting against the Soft Machine was butting against 808 State wouldn't work from a salability perspective, but that's not what Peel's shows sounded like, nor why he broadcast. While John Peel: A Tribute is 40 tracks of lovely, listenable music, I can't help thinking Peel would view it with a bit of suspicion. But then, he'd probably view any kind of tribute to his humble self with a bit of suspicion. He was just a guy who played records for a living, after all.","Since you're reading Pitchfork, I assume you have an idea of who the late, great John Peel was. And ...

Safer Here,Dawn Smithson,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c413d197565213926b/1:1/w_160/286c9224.jpg,2005-11-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7835-safer-here/,Kranky,"Dawn Smithson played bass and sang for the ambitious, Kraut-inspired combo Jessamine, and has recently performed with doom-metal behemoths Sunn O))), so it comes as a mild surprise to witness her transition to the quiet, contemplative solo space of Safer Here. In an artistic progression strikingly similar to that of former Eric's Trip bassist Julie Doiron, Smithson has crafted a home-recorded, bittersweet songcycle in reverence of solitude. Utilizing a skeletal, percussion-less backdrop, the album centers its hermetic gaze upon Smithson's serene vocals and intimate, plainspoken lyrics to create an inviting haven, while coolly ignoring the fact that in music such safety is not necessarily the highest virtue. ""I may not be happy/ At least I know I'm Safer Here/ Nothing to fear,"" Smithson sings on the opener and title track, setting the album's melancholic tone of resigned isolation. And despite tasteful contributions such guests as Rex Ritter (Jessamine, Fontanelle) and Brian Foote (Fontanelle, Nudge)-- in addition to Smithson's skillful vocal and instrumental overdubs-- tracks such as ""Somewhere Far"" and ""How Thoughtless"" still sound resolutely isolated, as though constructed miles apart from gainful human contact. Unfortunately, however, Smithson's performances here lack the ecstatic fervor of Kranky labelmate Christina Carter's solo works, or the soul-plumbing intensity of Cat Power, and instead too often settles into rather faceless bedroom indie-strum. Perhaps the roots of the album's retreating solitude are exposed on tracks like the heartsick ""Nowhere Near"" (""I remember wondering how I'd ever get over you""), or the angry ""Letter to the Empire"", which delivers politically-charged journal entries like ""I prefer to trust my eyes/ And all I see is pointless death,"" or ""When you say liberate, you're lying"" with a lullaby coo rather than a bullhorn. This overriding sense of disillusion and loss reaches a depressive apex on ""Ticking Away"", whose narrator seems trapped in defeated stasis, lamenting ""While the seasons turn/ I just stand here watching/ Waiting for something to push me on,"" over an acoustic guitar that chimes with the nagging regularity of a grandfather clock. On the layered ""Speak Through Me"", Smithson adds a toothsome dissonance to her overdubbed vocal roundelay, and David Farrell's synth swells provide ""A New Day"" with a graceful drone. Such flourishes do wonders to spruce up Safer Here's spare sonic terrain, and as the album draws to its uncertain finish on ""Crossroads"" (""So much is wasted/ I can't look anymore/ For fear I might drown""), it seems reasonable to conclude that next time, Smithson might be well served-- musically and otherwise-- to stray much farther from her erstwhile comfort zone.","Jessamine and Sunn O))) collaborator issues a quiet, contemplative solo record.

Songs of Green Pheasant,Songs of Green Pheasant,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c55e6ef95969320e00/1:1/w_160/05d28211.gif,2005-11-08 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7836-songs-of-green-pheasant/,Fat Cat,"The mythology surrounding Songs of Green Pheasant (aka Duncan Sumpner) is simply too good to be true. So this Sumpner guy, schoolteacher by day, folk DIY whiz by night, shacks up in the boondocks of England and records an LP in his kitchen using nothing but a four-track. To further thicken this Disney-movie plot, Sumpner originally just sat on the recordings, neglecting to solicit any potentially interested labels. According to legend, eventual label Fat Cat received the demos in 2002, but only recently managed to contact Sumpner due to his mysterious vagabond lifestyle. Fortunately scouring all of England for this self-titled debut proves worth the wait, and Sumpner's nuts and bolts approach further enriches Fat Cat's already impressive folk booty. As its conditions suggest, Songs sounds distinctly removed from any current trends. If Animal Collective is Fat Cat's frenetic, avant-garde weapon of choice, Songs plays the trusty old revolver role to a T. The lo-fi recording quality harkens back to 60s staples like Simon & Garfunkel or Nick Drake, not to mention Sumpner's haunting pastoral imagery. The dude sings what he knows, and nuts to anyone averse to songs about trees, night, day and love. Opener ""I Am Daylights"" awakens the senses like a Maxwell House commercial, harnessing an improbably healthy blend of corny guitar plucking and angelic harmonies. Sumpner ain't all about lovey-dovey ephemeral stuff though, and at times he resembles the sharp melodic mettle of Sufjan Stevens. ""Nightfall (For Boris P.)"" and ""Knulp"" aren't exactly ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", though both feature catchy melodies delicately playing off equally gossamer acoustic riffs. Unfortunately, the Sufjan similarities end there. The patchwork Songs often succumbs to attrition, lacking enough swirling builds and surprises to sustain its initial birr over 10 tracks. Balking at choruses and complex song structure in general, Sumpner flattens his debut into one sedated, 40-minute campfire outing. True, folkies wear such minimalism like a badge, though Songs begs the question of whether Sumpner's a better songwriter or aesthetic-catcher-- or worse, just a feel-good story attached to a mediocre artist. Regardless, hats off to a folk musician who literally embodies as much lore as his mystical music, and it's exciting to think what this guy could do with a nice eight-track, let alone a full-blown recording studio.","Reclusive folk DIY whiz releases his debut album years after it was first sent to Fat Cat.

Jehovah Surrender EP,The Skygreen Leopards,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67013d19756521391a9/1:1/w_160/10673a3f.gif,2005-11-08 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7761-jehovah-surrender-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"It's perfectly apt that advance copies of the new Skygreen Leopards EP come with a press kit that's almost unreadable. Even as the most ordered and poppy band in the Jewelled Antler constellation, which curates all things fractured and sublime (from droning field recordings to improvised psych-folk), Skygreen Leopards' music is similarly effaced, favoring a quaint and trippy aura over slick veneer. Naturalistic process is paramount; albums come with pithy back-stories haloed in hazy traceries of light, flickering with pastoral forest music, and whispering tape-hiss sprites. The story here involves a visit to an acquaintance of Arlo Guthrie, a shed containing an ""ancient drumset"" and a ""cobwebby electric guitar,"" an all-night jam session, and daughters dancing in the moonlight. Skygreen Leopards recognizes the power inherent in old things, not just in the sounds they can make, but in the way their dormant charge of history (all that music, built up inside them) can detonate in the mind of the reverent user, blowing open the doors that lead away from self-consciousness and toward spontaneous states where music occurs as naturally as rain. And maybe they also found an ancient Xerox machine in that shed, all splintery wood and rusted iron gears, and used it to run off the ghostly, barely-there text in their one sheet. Readability would definitely take a back seat to the authenticity of the antique with Skygreen Leopards. Since Skygreen Leopards' experiments hinge more on the magic moment-- a ""first thought, best thought"" impulse the Beats would've admired-- than the deliberate path, and because their naturalistic-bordering-on-mystical aesthetic is firmly established, Jehovah Surrender falls within their usual parameters: Six brightly misty psych-pop relics that barely hang together, reveling in organic now-ness instead of professional precision, charting another little section of the sun-baked pasture of Donovan Quinn's and Glenn Donaldson's collective mind. The percussion has three modes, all of them similar: shambolic, faltering, and clumsy, although the dropped beats are part and parcel of their authenticity-of-imperfection vibe. On ""Jehovah I Surrender"", jerky rhythm guitars stab at approximate drum fills; a soaring vocal bleeds pastel light; a fuzzy psych-rock lead trudges woozily across the scene with weary grandeur. Standout track ""Apparition of Suns (aka The Ferryman's Long Arms)"" is full of bleary harmonies, with a terrifically druggy, weightless vibe. On ""I Was a Thief"", a throttled fuzz-bass line climbs and hovers in mid-air, and on ""Let the Lion be Swallowed by a Dove"", bleating foghorn-like guitars break like dawn over a jaunty strum. If Black Mountain is a cryogenically-frozen Velvet Underground awaking crusty-eyed but unbowed in the new millennium, Skygreen Leopards is Syd Barrett after the same long nap. Urban legend has it that anyone named Donovan's birth certificate comes printed on a handsome paisley stock; this stuff is hardwired into them.","New EP from the most ordered and poppy band in the Jewelled Antler constellation.

Solid Gold Hits,Beastie Boys,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24513d1975652138825/1:1/w_160/a03e5390.gif,2005-11-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/609-solid-gold-hits/,Capitol,"On 1994's Ill Communication, ""Sabotage"" was an acid-laced pipe bomb, positioned after the pulsing salsa/samba/ethno-jam ""Root Down"" and the backpacker-luring ""Get It Together"". On Solid Gold Hits' extricated format, nestled between a clunky Fatboy Slim remix and hip-hop crossover ""Fight for Your Right (to Party)"", it sounds a lot like what it is: a rap-rock song. Forget the Spike Jonze video (it's on the bonus DVD); this is rap-rock, alive with shambolic drums and Ad-Rock's inimitable goblin-howl. And it's splendid-- timeless, even. But let's not kid ourselves: It helped spawn some miserable music. Here's the problem with hits compilations: They really force you to look at hits closely, unguarded by the whipping propeller of the new. A facile concept, maybe. Thing is, institution acts-- of which the Beasties hang with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beck and Metallica and Pearl Jam-- either get a free pass or make ""great"" albums buoyed by the times they exist in. Compilations require magnifying glasses. The Beastie Boys are best seen with binoculars and the sound way up. Solid Gold Hits knowingly hopscotches from era to era. But there's no purpose, other than to infuriate and flaunt diversity, maybe. The coldest, meanest beat Ad-Rock, MCA, and Mike D ever rapped over can be found on ""Pass the Mic"", an aggro-jaunt that changes tempos so effortlessly it sounds like three different songs. It also happens to be one of the most fiercely rapped songs in their catalogue (""Everybody rapping like it's a commercial...""). To follow it up here with the saccharine ""An Open Letter to NYC"" from last year's To the Five Boroughs only amplifies the trio's diminished skills and creeping irrelevance. Three songs are included here from the Beasties' quasi-infamous debut LP Licensed to Ill. Last year, in light of the album's reissuing, Pitchfork's Dominique Leone wrote, ""Okay, so it isn't the music or all the rhymes that translate beyond the scene of the crime. What, then? Probably just that the Beasties didn't give a fuck-- AND AMERICA DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE SHOWN HOW NOT TO GIVE A FUCK."" With respect, place my hat in the ""giving a fuck"" ring because ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" did, does, and always will sound horrendously lame. Hey, they were kids. Me, too. Unfortunately, the album's most durable gems (""Hold It Now, Hit It"", ""Rhymin and Stealin"") are absent here. Worse, Paul's Boutique-- theirs and the Dust Brothers' masterpiece-- is underrepresented at only two songs. Without ax-grinding, if this were my Beastie Boys CD-R I'd take ""Shadrach"" and ""Neogtiation Limerick File"" over ""Triple Trouble"" and ""Ch-Check It Out"" (though the Miss Piggy gag is great in retrospect). Of course, hits are hits are hits. Which means their pre-succcess single ""She's On It"" is nowhere to be found. Still, I can't quarrel with the magnitude of the best of these songs: ""Sure Shot"" is a superb lesson in pick-and-roll rap; ""Shake Your Rump"" is ripe with nonsensical quotables; ""Intergalactic"" is robotically charming. New listens even reveal a sublimely downmixed organ that really sustains the breakbeat. All said, 1999's 2xCD The Sounds of Science is a far superior collection of songs, both essential and superfluous. It's not much more expensive-- plus it doesn't have a title as MOR as Solid Gold Hits. For the novice, this is a quaint introduction, but one that fails to recognize the congealing brilliance of the Beastie canon. Their albums-- even the overstuffed ones-- have a hypnotic groove to them. There's no point in fucking that sort of thing up.","Single-disc compilation collects the best-known rather than the best from the NYC trio.

Such is the bitch of imports, but shit, such is the lure isn't it-- why more American indie labels don't ghostprint from Europe shocks me. All's to say, Output keeping itself overseas might have been the best thing to happen to Colder aka Marc Nguyen Tan. Now, and for his sake hopefully forever, this gentleman weaver has import sticker authority, peddling flimsy replicas of rock history to the American lookyloo demographic who faithfully support the New and Obscure but still haven't heard a fucking note of Joy Division or Suicide. It's a killer business model: Two years ago this Colder guy came over here for CMJ and played at the Canal Room, stuck behind a smoke machine, chumming one chord and whispering ""it's getting...COLLLL-DERRRR"" for like, 10 minutes straight-- and people clapped! Time to get this guy a rap deal and watch the ""French Mike Jones"" flow like whatnots. Listen, I have a big heart for clumsy stuff, the fake stuff even more. In some probably incriminating way, I like a good deal of the fake stuff-- e.g. the beat and a-go-go frequencies from South-East Asia, Radio Pyongyang, assorted gimmicks-- more than the real stuff, precisely because the language barrier and tooth'n'nails recording and palpably high stakes make otherwise straight Beatles rips pretty damn unsettling, and I value that. Maybe, maybe some of Colder's stuff could hit me that way, Paris on Curtis, what have you. But sorry, ""Oh yeah tonight oh yeah that's right to-night""-- the song's called ""Tonight""-- ain't clumsy, or fake, just bad. So beyond Colder's better-formed lyrics, which somehow make them worse lyrics, what's changed from his debut Again? To his credit, now he has a few songs that DJs can play, like ""Wrong Baby"", a midtempo sway that fits nicely between Kraftwerk's ""Numbers"" and ""Bizarre Love Triangle."" Colder's got better guitar sounds too, and on ""Losing Myself"" they shimmy enough that maybe MTV will find room for a clip in whatever Road Rules segment it is where people come back from a dive bar or fight snakes in the desert or something. The album's last three tracks go back to mine, loungey numbers to cool down Heat's (wait for it) burners; had Colder picked one instead of three (my vote is for the painfully alone casiotones of ""Fade Away""), he might have been onto something.

For a Decade of Sin: 11 Years of Bloodshot Records,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85813d1975652139620/1:1/w_160/83ac93d8.jpg,2005-11-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2102-for-a-decade-of-sin-11-years-of-bloodshot-records/,Bloodshot,"Maybe it makes sense on the business end, but from this critical perspective, For a Decade of Sin: 11 Years of Bloodshot Records seems a little strange: To celebrate a decade of existence and 125 releases, the Chicago label has released a two-disc compilation featuring numerous acts from other rosters. That's like putting ringers on your company softball team-- you're just admitting that no one in your office can connect bat with ball. But I doubt the compilers were thinking that way when they put together this 42-song tracklist; on the contrary, their aim is to show how the Bloodshot aesthetic has spread beyond the label's modest stable of artists into the wider indie realm. However, For a Decade of Sin works on a much smaller scale; it's not so concerned with the larger state of the field as much as the confines of alt-country, a genre it didn't create but helped rear. This compilation doesn't present a unified Bloodshot aesthetic because there is no such thing: the songs show just how wide ranging alt-country can be, and the artists sound very different, despite grazing the same pastureland between country and rock, punk and a little bluegrass. So many cattle, so many different brands. Some of these artists take a direct route and solder country sounds onto rock momentum. The results can be amazing-- or not. Bobby Bare Jr.'s ""Ocean Size"" gets by on the singer's unpretentious charm and vast longing, and Catfish Haven's catchy ""Tell Me"" heralds their Secretly Canadian debut next year, but the Deadstring Bothers' ""Where Are All My Friends?"" is weepy and self-absorbed and ""Harridan of Yore"" by Graham Parker & the Figgs just sounds like lo-cal Dylan. Other artists take a different tack and pick up where country tradition left off, reviving it faithfully or with an ear for how it never was. While dramatically different, Sally Timms' dusky version of ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and Wayne Hancock and Hank Williams III's tear through ""Juke Joint Jumping"" sound like they could have been recorded in any of the previous four decades. Unfortunately, artists like Scott H. Biram, 16 Horsepower, and Nine Pound Hammer take one or two aspects from whichever tradition and exaggerate them to cartoonish extremes, but these eminently skippable tracks are partially redeemed by Mary Lou Lord, Cordero, the Court and Spark, Crooked Fingers, and Richard Buckner, whose sound is so natural and unfussy as to have very little obvious regard for any particular strain of influence. Covers abound on For a Decade of Sin, showing a range of influences both old and new. Dollar Store turn in a limp retread of the Soft Boys' ""I Wanna Destroy You"" and Porter Hall TN do Jim Carroll's ""People Who Died"" note for obvious note. But My Morning Jacket's version of ""Behind That Locked Door"" possesses a sad gracefulness, and the Sadies help Andre Williams recover his classic ""Shake a Tail Feather"". The collection's best track-- cover or otherwise-- is courtesy of Milton Mapes, who finds a gem in the Cowboy Junkies lament ""Now I Know"". All this variety suggests that Bloodshot is doing something right. It has made a name for itself in a niche market while at the same time proving that niche isn't so small. But what makes for a successful label doesn't always produce a good compilation. For a Decade of Sin is full of ups and downs and even a few sideways, and so lacks transitions and fluid sequencing. You'll probably listen to the whole thing all the way through only once or twice; after that, you'll most likely burn your favorite 10 to your iPod-- 15 if you're a real fan. Only about half of those songs will be Bloodshot recording artists.","Chicago's Bloodshot Records celebrates its 11th anniversary with a 2xCD, 42-track compilation featuring Crooked Fingers, Richard Buckner, and Sally Timms, among others.

Bagged and Boarded,Goblin Cock,by: Judson Picco,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0295e6ef959693234ec/1:1/w_160/d594af87.jpg,2005-11-07 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3687-bagged-and-boarded/,Absolutely Kosher,"Way back on Heavy Vegetable's second astonishing album, Frisbie, Rob Crow(lately of Pinback, for the most part) defended his distaste for the radio by listing stuff they never played on it: Slint, Sentridoh, Zappa, Beefheart, Can, The Residents, VU. See any metal in that list? Neither do I. Was Rob Crow managing to hear some metal anyhow? You bet your ass. Is Goblin Cock as ""joke-metal"" as it sounds like it should be? Just about. Its chugging, Tolkien-core centerpiece is an ode to ""Kegrah the Dragon Killer"". Plus the liner notes include lyrics written in runes. Goblin Cock never quite goes Spinal Tap, though; this is by no means your simple ""Metal is pretty funny"" put-down record. There was always a seriousness of chops and a whiff of that gloriously bloated prog- and/or death-metal surrounding 90s-Crow projects Heavy Vegetable and Thingy, and Bagged and Boarded is the noxious encroaching cloud that whiff's blossomed into over the years. If faux-classical acoustic guitar and synth on ""Hissy (Intro)"" is the go-nowhere warmup to some magnum opus, then ""Stumped"" (like the bulk of Bagged and Boarded) must be Really Heavy Vegetable, with Crow's practiced nasal yelp thinly breaking through the band's mutant-Sabbath dirge. Speaking of twisted Black Sabbath descendants, the Queens of the Stone Age quotient's equally high on ""Childproof""; it's got excruciating old sex-ed film reel samples that reaffirm the ""cock"" theme with 50s Dad-to-son explanations of the old, shall we say, equipment and what sometimes comes out of it while male teens dream, recalling a certain porn interlude on Dr. Octagon's Dr. Octagonecologyst. ""Gee, our bodies are complicated, aren't they Dad?"" It's hard not to laugh and cringe simultaneously. Great Uncle GWAR would be so proud. Lord Phallus, Bane Ass-Pounder, King Sith, Braindeath, and keyboardist Loki Sinjuggler drop that imaginary line between humor and horror down front and center, forcing listeners to straddle it with them. On ""Revenge of Snufalufagus"", ""Sesame Street'""s gentle Snufalufagus directs his murderous, vengeful bloodlust toward Mr. Hooper and/or Big Bird. ""The Werewomb""-- Cannibal Corpse outtake though that may sound-- is about the closest the record comes to unearthing a nugget of vintage mid-90s Crow. ""Winkey Dinky Donkey"" (not a Raffi cover, amazingly) might hold that same distinction but for its opening minute of double-tracked vocals and riffs that, melodically, live right next door to Metallica's ...And Justice For All. What I can't do is honestly recommend any of this to your strict Pinbackers or serious metalheads in want of some inroad into either indie or Rob Crow's byzantine bandscape. The somewhat brittle production, dearth of any blast beat/guitar screed overkill, and lax musicianship will offend a good deal of those hardened listener's ears even if Goblin Cock's upfront skewering of metal's silliest conventions fails to. As comic book collectors will recognize the moment they read the album title, a sense of humor going in is utterly, 100% required. One glance at the cover sears this image into your retina: Goblin Cock as iconic heavy metal D&D; bad guy's purply veined phallus. The band's name is also a sly pun on the performance of enthusiastic fellatio. Still, it's just as funny to picture Goblin Cock as the biggest, meanest, ugliest armored black rooster in the history of Things Frank Frazetta Never Got Around to Painting, and a leather-clad Rob Crow strumming distorted power chords to the rhythmic fall of his steed's ghastly red talons.","Absolutely Kosher presents faux-metal from Pinback's Rob Crow.

Propeller,Guided by Voices,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfcb5e6ef95969323469/1:1/w_160/972a3300.gif,2005-11-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3602-propeller/,RockathonRockathon,"At this very moment, there is an original pressing of Propeller selling on eBay with a starting price of $850. In his new history of the band, Guided by Voices: 20 Years of Hunting Accidents in the Forests of Rock and Roll, James Greer tells of a copy that eventually sold for more than $6,000. It's not hard to see why these records are so costly and coveted: Only 500 were pressed in 1992, and band members and assorted hangers-on decorated each of them by hand, mimicking Robert Pollard's collage-style graphics, in the process making each one unique. In its 13 years of existence, Propeller has been much more lovingly preserved on vinyl than on compact disc. For years, I only knew it as the other half of Vampire on Titus, which always made me recall Big Star's #1 Record and Radio City (both bound together on the same disc, still awaiting separate deluxe reissues). That's good company, and an appropriate connection, but for me, Propeller always suffered the proximity of the disinviting Vampire on Titus, as fanged an album as its title implies. Now, with Scat Records reissuing Propeller, the emphasis is again squarely on vinyl. The CD version has nice new packaging featuring several of Pollard's collages, essentially enabling you to choose your own cover. But it pales in comparison to the LP itself, which includes an insert with 81 of the original collage covers and reproduces the #14 cover (""50 EGGS"") and the boxing diagrams in their original 12""x12"" dimensions. Despite its release during the heyday of the compact disc, Propeller seems to be an album primarily intended for vinyl and its enthusiasts; any other medium remains an afterthought. The music that goes on vinyl also comes from vinyl: Propeller sounds like a sonic collage gathered from what would seem like an exhaustive collection of 70s rock LPs-- Cheap Trick, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, John Lennon, maybe even some Wings. On Propeller these period-rock influences are closer to the surface than on subsequent GbV albums. It's Pollard's first big rock statement, from the crowd chants that open side one to the anthemic guitar chords that end side two. As such, it's a little rough here and there, its slight imperfections alternately amplified and pardoned by its lo-fi sound, but ultimately it remains insistent and compelling. Bee Thousand is written about more often and exalted more devotedly (and rightly so), but Propeller proves just as essential to the Guided by Voices mythos. More than that, it's just a solid rock album, one that gives you all the tools you need to understand and appreciate it. Enjoying it should be easy. ""G! B! V! G! B! V!"" the crowd chants at the beginning of ""Over the Neptune"", and presumably it's Pollard who yells, ""Are you ready to rock?"" That's a bold, somewhat self-deprecating kick-off for a band whose audience at the time barely extended beyond Ohio and who were pressing only 500 copies of what they wanted to be their breakthrough album. But that introduction not only predicts the obsessive cult that would gradually surround Pollard, but it also prefaces a medley (""Over the Neptune"" bleeds neatly and dramatically into ""Mesh Gear Fox"") that contains the whole of Pollard's large and complex philosophy about rock and roll and about the inspiration he derives from a live crowd (""It's the way you look it's the way you act when you're near me,"" he sings at the song's climactic push). Those chanting voices are the ones that guide him, and here they usher you into Pollard's world, where you learn to decipher his coded lyrics and speak his rock language. Propeller achieves what Pollard calls on ""Weedking"" a ""violent pace."" That song picks up where ""Over the Neptune/Mesh Gear Fox"" leaves off-- in full rock anthem mode. It begins with the rallying cry, ""Long live Rockathon"", which is both a shout-out to the band's fledgling minilabel and a concise summation of a credo for long, beery live shows. With its affectionately re-created Beatles harmonies, the chorus of ""Quality of Armor"" reappears precipitously throughout the song, slyly inverting the come-on of ""Drive My Car"". ""Metal Mothers"" bleeds pop melancholia, and the popping guitar melody of ""Unleashed! The Largehearted Boy"" creates a bouncy momentum that carries into ""Exit Flagger"", with its unannounced and powerful racing=death metaphor. After the perfect adolescent wistfulness of ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront"", Propeller trails off as it makes its way to the finish line. Still, after the odd collage ""Ergo Space Pig"", ""Circus World"" and ""Some Drilling Implied"" give the band a chance to run through more guitar solos, breakdowns, rock dramatics that you'd think lo-fi was capable of sustaining. But the sound preempts any chance of irony-- all those rock anthems, monumental choruses, and microphone windmills are completely from the boy's large heart. That's the key to the band's appeal, the factor often missed or simply left unstated: Pollard believes in rock and roll, and Propeller is his sacrifice on the altar. And that lo-fi sound is essential: it preserved the illusion of connection between performer and listener, hinting at an intimacy that Pollard knows doesn't exist, but damned if he isn't going to try.","Overdue reissue of the 1992 lo-fi classic, originally released in an edition of 500, uniquely packaged copies.

Get Rich or Die Tryin' OST,Various Artists,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8d13d197565213b57b/1:1/w_160/4f975625.gif,2005-11-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3047-get-rich-or-die-tryin-ost/,Interscope,"It's difficult to remember now, but there was a moment in late 2002 when 50 Cent seemed like exactly what rap needed. Here was a guy who'd come out of nowhere with an endlessly hypnotic slurpy singsong flow spitting unbelievably hard, violent street shit and naming names. He'd put the entire rap world on blast in ""How to Rob an Industry Nigga"", he had impeccable mixtape credentials, and he already carried himself like a star. He received the backing of Dr. Dre and Eminem, and there was nothing to stop him from just destroying wack candy rappers like Ja Rule and running wild all over the industry. And then, of course, he became the biggest rap star on the planet. He endorsed video games and vitamin water and doo-rags. He started meaningless feuds for no good reason. Earlier this year, he released The Massacre, an album bloated with maddeningly half-assed asshole-rap that will probably end up being the biggest-selling record of 2005. And now he's made a movie. Get Rich or Die Tryin' is 50's attempt to make his own 8 Mile, right down to the legend-building loosely autobiographical story, respectably middlebrow director, and grainy verite cinematography. We'll know next week whether it's as boring as 8 Mile. But 50's done something surprising with the Get Rich soundtrack. If the movie is his respectability move, the soundtrack is a direct anti-pop move, a record full of hard, grim, liquid NYC street-rap-- woozy flanged guitars and swollen horns and nonchalant bloodlust. All the rappers here come from 50's G-Unit camp, and most of the beats come from no-name producers like K.O. and B-Money. And the oddly coesive result is the best G-Unit album since Young Buck's Straight Outta Ca$hville. There are sex-raps and party-raps here, but the R&B elements are played down to the point where they sound just like the gangsta tracks, all bleary windswept glistening soul samples, not a ""Candy Shop"" in sight. And sometimes, as with the monstrous foghorn tuba stomp on ""I'll Whup Ya Head"" and the magnetic descending Spanish guitar on ""You Already Know"", the tracks find an irresistibly hazy widescreen throb. Maybe the experience of playing his younger self onscreen has helped 50 recapture some of the hunger he had a couple of years ago. Throughout the album, 50 keeps all the confidence he had on The Massacre but little of the arrogance. His murder-talk threats have a real bite: ""Let's ride around, find a nigga stuntin' on Front Street/ With the shines on, niggas be lookin' like lunchmeat."" And his boasts have a nonchalant irreverence: ""If I wore a suit everyday like Jay-Z/ Niggas would think I bumped my fuckin' head and went crazy."" Occasionally he lapses into hegemonic self-parody (""I see something special when I look in ya eyes/ With ya legs way back, I say this pussy is mine""), but for once that's the exception. Nearly all of 50's backup guys play their roles to perfection. Lloyd Banks returns to his mini-50 tauntingly mannered mumble-flow. Young Buck steals a couple of tracks with his hard-as-fuck predatory drawl. M.O.P. makes a dependably bananas gutter-stomp appearance on ""When Death Becomes You"", nicely offset by 50's slinky hook and the song's lush, dramatic production. Mase, probably 50's biggest influence as a rapper, gives a tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if he'd never abandoned street-rap. Even the crew's two worst rappers, Tony Yayo and Spider Loc, prove effective in small doses, their flaws camouflaged by excellent production and better rappers. Only the Mobb Deep guys, Havoc especially, get lost, their dead-eyed nihilism not making the transition to the album's cinematic hardness. Not everyone can do this movie-thug thing.

Summer in the Southeast,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2aab1335d7bf169853e/1:1/w_160/e1e49efc.jpg,2005-11-07 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/704-summer-in-the-southeast/,Sea Note,"Summer in the Southeast is ostensibly Will Oldham's first live album, but it feels strangely familiar. Perhaps it's because his best albums are as intimate and affecting as a cloistered club gig. Or perhaps it's because this album comes only one year after I Am a Cold Rock, a vapid tribute album, and Greatest Palace Hits, a compilation with embellished renditions of some of his best-known songs. The latter was contrived and caustic, employing stately session musicians in the service of mechanized self-parody. Unlike Palace Hits' cryptic assortment of sterile performances, Southeast summons all the power and potency of a competent backing band without suffering any homogenization. Brash and unhinged, Oldham is able to evade the polished sheen that diffused his earlier effort; for a musician whose erratic solo shows often fail to evoke the vitality of his records, this is a delightfully drunken racket of tangled guitars and thunderous percussion. The album captures an anger and regret intense enough to nearly bruise listeners and attendees, but also manages to preserve the pristine trembles in Oldham's throat. Imagine the forceful clarity of Superwolf applied to Palace's entire catalog: vaporous guitars elevating frail backwoods ditties into tornadic Texan epics. ""Blokbuster"" and ""Break of Day"" are vastly more impressive than their studio counterparts, paying tribute to Kranky ambiance and Neil Young's lassoed solos. The band-- which here includes Matt Sweeney and David Bird on guitar, Paul Oldham on bass, and Pink Nasty (author of the inestimable ""What the Fuck"") on back-up vocals-- often veers toward some fascinating experiments in prog mysticism (""A Sucker's Evening"", ""O Let It Be"") and convulsive psych (""Madeleine Mary""). The vaudeville ragtime of ""I Send My Love to You"" cops as much from the Mekons as Mr. Kite, while those in search of vintage Bonnie gloom will find solace in the glazed keyboards and crumbling voices of ""Wolf Among Wolves"" and ""Nomadic Revery"". Oldham's willingness to navigate his band through odd tones and genres can also end in noxious mediocrity, though: ""May It Always Be"", one of Ease Down the Road's best songs, gravitates around flaccid punk riffs at an absurd volume. And at its worst, the album approximates-- however bizarrely-- Yield-era Pearl Jam. Fortunately, most of the album's other blemishes are veiled blessings: What could be more ingratiating than a Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy album with poor fidelity, giggling herbs, trampled Rolling Rock bottles, and reams of static? Where else can you hear the abashed elation of an entire club singing ""Death to Everyone"", or Oldham mumbling that he ""got clown in his face,"" or an asshole, surrounded by cackling girls, advising the band to ""play hard"" as Oldham wanders into the tender sorrow of ""I See a Darkness""? Summer in the Southeast is far from perfect as an aesthetic statement-- or even as a recording-- but as a document of Oldham's irresistible occultism, it could hardly be more effective.","Live album from Will Oldham was recorded with a capable band that includes Matt Sweeney, resulting in a delightfully drunken racket of tangled guitars and thunderous percussion.

Still, it's just as easy to under-credit them-- they're no Coppolas (bosom buddies, though), but dismissing them as lucked-out industry offspring's a piece of cake, too: Bassist Charlotte Froom is daughter of producer Mitchell Froom; drummer Tennessee Thomas is daughter of Pete Thomas (drummer for Elvis Costello); vocalist/guitarist Z Berg is daughter of Geffen hotshot/producer Tony Berg. They're living teen-girl pipe dreams, straight-out-of-another-teen-movie plots: the Crossroads classmates started up in 2001 at the ages of fifteen and sixteen-- Charlotte had been playing bass for two weeks-- are buddies with uber-pretty boys Maroon 5, Rooney, and Phantom Planet, and have really great legs. Jump to whatever conclusions, but thank God, anyway, they're not a shemo band playing bitter-bitch rock; if we're to die at the hands of the Like, it'd be something like death by mosquito net-- Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? is a bundled-up, gauzy deathtrap of the prettiest of bug-deterrents. The hiccupped sweetness and light of Berg's pipes draws apt comparisons to the Sundays' Harriet Wheeler; her lower-ranges drop into sexed-up, Bjork-like bottom-scraping; it's all terribly charming. Too bad lyrics are straight from soporific bio class margin-notes-- initials in hearts, Mr. So-and-So, Mrs. Actually. ""June Gloom"" could be as glumly endearing as any Throwing Muses tune, if it weren't for its cited sunsets and hazy grey skies, trite as the stuff of Freddie Prinze films (""Wish that I could save you/ Wish that I could stop this""). The Like never turn saccharine, but seldom delve much deeper than recess romances: ""Bridge to Nowhere"" and ""You Bring Me Down"" are the dreamiest of gripes-- ""I can't be who you wanted me to be""; ""Once Things Look Up"" is typical Like-- just courting ideal, stopping just short-- and catchier tracks sometimes teeter close to excellent: See ""Falling Away"", poised to morph into Republica's ""Ready to Go"", like some woozy tilt-a-whirl that won't make you hurl chunks. ""Waves that never break"" sums it up best-- Berg sings, ""Break me or something/ 'Cause I'm fading away/ Am I waiting for nothing?"", all the while we're waiting for some killer hook that never comes. (""What I Say And What I Mean"", the closest the Like ever get to a memorable pop single, sounds perilously akin to Ashlee Simpson's ""Boyfriend"".) But maybe Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? is all it professes to be: misunderstanding, indecision, ambiguity. Here's miscommunication, talking past, boys not getting the difference between what girls say and what they mean; here's oft-thought sentiments like the ones on ""Under the Paving Stones"": ""Hey haven't you heard you have the right to make a move?""

Alive & Wired,Old 97's,by: Stephen M.

This was right before the 2001 release of Satellite Rides, and the band seemed happy to be performing new material like ""Rollerskate Skinny"" and ""Book of Poems"". Plus, they were playing a run of hometown shows after a long absence, so the crowd was excited to have their local heroes back for a few nights. Packed into the Tea Room shoulder to shoulder, fans sang along with every word of ""Busted Afternoon"" and ""Big Brown Eyes"", and at least attempted singing along to ""Doreen"". They fed off the band's excitement, and in turn the Old 97s fed off the crowd's rambunctious energy. Ken Bethea deployed his perfectly compact solos, Rhett Miller did some of those mini-Pete Townsend windmills on his guitar, and Murry Hammond stepped up for awkwardly graceful versions of ""West Texas Teardrops"" and ""Valentine"". That show completely erased the distinction between the Old 97s' early alt-country material and their later power-pop songs-- a distinction that's been particularly divisive among fans and critics and that once seemed impossible to resolve. No longer: Alive & Wired, the band's first live release, duplicates this feat, finding a Texarkana middle ground between the two genres. Granted, there have always been traces of pop in the nerd-country of their first three albums, just as there has always been a little lingering country on Fight Songs and Satellite Rides. But if these two sides of the band once seemed fairly neatly divided on studio albums, the live setting helps Old 97s collapse them completely. Recorded at Gruene's just outside of New Braunfels, Texas, Alive & Wired collects songs from each of their six albums, along with B-sides ""The Villain"" and Hammond's cover of Merle Haggard's ""Mama Tried"". The band's energy ebbs on slower songs like ""Lonely Holiday"", but crests on faster numbers like ""Melt Show"" and singalongs like ""Rollerskate Skinny"". By culling from early releases and rescuing tracks from last year's tepid Drag It Up, the band showcases a surprisingly deep and ridiculously rich canon of loser anthems (""Wish the Worst""), dark ballads (""Salome""), odes to romantic doubt and suspicion (""The Other Shoe""), cowboy calls (""West Texas Teardrops""), and frenzied barnstormers (""Doreen"")-- all written and played with generous humor and genuine exhilaration. Granted, Alive & Wired can't live up to the Old 97s' Tea Room show, in the same way that no live album can match the experience of actually being there. The record lacks the sensory elements that make such performances so memorable-- the glare of the neon signs on the wall; the smell of body odor and beer; the rough, rhythmic jostle of the packed crowd; the acrid taste of cigarette smoke. These sensations inform and infuse the band's songs-- not just the romantic desperation and confliction of Miller's lyrics, but the snap of the music-- to such a degree that an Old 97s live album seems incomplete without them.","Recorded in Texas, this live LP collects songs from each of the band's six albums, along with a cover of Merle Haggard's ""Mama Tried"".

Fires in Distant Buildings,Gravenhurst,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff8c0084474cd0c3101/1:1/w_160/33e34bb9.jpg,2005-11-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3642-fires-in-distant-buildings/,Warp,"Hidden amongst the largely electronic Warp Records stable, Gravenhurst have recorded two albums of hushed folk; on their third album, Fires in Distant Buildings, they take a bold step forward. Opener ""Down River"" sounds different from the off, with pronounced drums and an ominous low-end, a minimal, slowly unfolding riff, and few words getting in the way of its distorted climax. ""Velvet Cell"" is the biggest digression, a sleek Interpol clone with quick, clean downstrokes, Talbot's voice clear and plaintive while introducing the album's macabre preoccupations: ""To understand a killer/ I must become a killer/ Now I've tasted hatred, I want more."" ""Animals"" holds back musically but keeps the dark streak lyrically, a quiet strum of clean guitars, hushed cymbal crashes, and pale organ, not to mention a killer opening line: ""They descend upon the city like flies/ Spring their eggs into a dead dog's eyes/ It's England on a Saturday night."" Suicidal laments and a blues guitar solo follow. Eventually Gravehurst return to their comfort zone, offering the heart-stopping acoustic waltz ""Nicole"" and ""Cities Beneath the Sea"", a gothic-tinged sea-shanty with an oddly cheerful bass part and droning church organs. ""Songs From Under the Arches"" further explores the band's post-rock influence over 10 minutes of protracted morbidness, and the record closes with a cover of the Kinks' ""See My Friends"", which is given leaden underwater atmosphere that devolves into a loose jam session. Talbot's voice keeps me back from total immersion in the album's dark source material. Sure, low-key villains can be plenty creepy, and there's something to be said for juxtaposition, but not a shred of angst or aggression ever enters Talbot's voice. It all just seems so pleasant. Fires in Distant Buildings bears the calling cards of previous Gravenhurst albums-- the chilly atmosphere, the detached vocals, the attention to detail both instrumentally and lyrically-- but there's much emphasis given to new sounds that are well-executed but clearly indebted to other artists, and the murder ballads feel forced with Tobias' squeaky-clean delivery. The expansion of their sound is refreshing, and the subject matter lends the record a dark singularity, but Fires in Distant Buildings feels more like a transitional album than anything else.","Flatest record from Warp's hushed, quietly effective folk-rock band.

The band's second live release, Scab Dates is culled from performances between 2003 and 2005, in which the group streches already epic-length songs like ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"" and ""Cicatriz ESP"" into extended jams that, like many of the pieces on last year's Frances the Mute, have to be segmented across different tracks (""Cicatriz"" alone is in five parts totalling almost 40 minutes). Needless to say, the album is unlikely to win over anyone who bristled at the extended solos and song suites of Frances the Mute-- and yet, not one song from that album appears here; the bulk material is culled from the band's 2003 full-length De-Loused in the Comatorium. ""Veil Cerpin Taxt"" and ""Cicatriz"" comprise most of Scab Dates; what looks like 12 tracks is little more like three. Excepting the track taken from the Tremulant EP (""Concertina""), the record offers ""Abrasions Mount the Timpani"", an introductory sound collage played over an intercom while a few notes of guitar tantalize the audience, and ""Cavigula"" and ""Haruspex"", both mostly wordless jams that serve as tension builders and palette cleansers. Yes, Mars Volta show more than a fair share of instrumental prowess and flash, with licks that would make aspiring metal musos look up from their fretboards and nod in thoughtful approval; but like me, that person probably wants a little more from a live album than back-to-the-audience noodling from a rock band with modest improvisational skills. ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"" opens with a rhythm section adding urgency to the band's complex riffage. Divisions between the segments seem arbitrary, with a space-exploring instrumental break and a show-stopping unaccompanied guitar riff appearing before Part A even kicks in. While the band maintains the energy through the three different sections of the jagged ""Cerpin Taxt"", it eventually dips into ambient textures and dull instrumental passages during the marathon version of ""Cicatriz"" that closes the album. The first section-- eight minutes of organ solos and wah-pedal guitar-- would be over-doing it as it is. Throw in a slower, psychedelic interlude for Part I, reverberating vocal nonsense and muffled blues soloing for Part II, a part III that sounds a whole lot like Part I, and a slow moody 20-minute jam that crawls, and you have a new level of pushing the rock form past all levels of patience. Save a tossed-off Bowie reference in the mire of part III, there's nothing engaging or revealing added to these tracks. They're just a whole lot longer. To beat a dead horse, these songs don't need to be streched to be understood-- what remains desperately missing from the Mars Volta is context for their musings. Burrowing into these impenetrable instrumentals and decoding lyrics could be half the fun, but what's the point of ending the record on another sound collage that merges the final (20-minute) moody jam on Scab Dates with what sounds like backstage patter? That's an artful allusion to what-- an encore break? Given which songs are chosen and when this is being released, Scab Dates is a neither a concession nor a step forward, revealing inclinations that feel half as indulgent as they should when following a record like Frances the Mute, and about half as interesting to listen to. For this album to follow De-Loused in the Comatorium would at least have made some sense; now it's just more of the same.","Live album from the metal-prog giants was recorded between 2003 and 2005, but doesn't include any tracks from their recent Frances the Mute.

Several Arrows Later,Matt Pond PA,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e569fc7814a47cd760/1:1/w_160/7498df1c.jpg,2005-11-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5156-several-arrows-later/,Altitude,"Matt Pond PA rarely fail to fail to surprise and at first blush Several Arrows Later is unsurprisingly unsurprising. Like a teetotaler's Pete Yorn, Pond and his PAs here dour up the mid-Atlantic with the type of mature, restrained, polished yup-pop that ultimately made Tracks make tracks. Sure, MPPA's latest may seem like something a newly savvy freshperson might gladly play in Dad's Lexus RX that first Thanksgiving home, but somewhere beneath their grown-up cellos, glistening vibes, and tenderly yearning vocals, surely there lurks a drooling gonzo freak who isn't playing with a full quiver. Please? If Pond has a dark side, the first clue would be his 2003 move from Philadelphia, cradle of liberty and Cheez Whiz, to Brooklyn, home of feculence and chicanery and irony's much-feted fetid corpse. But ostensibly NYC-inspired fare like ""City Song"" and ""Brooklyn Stars"" proves devoid of all gothic Gotham horror: The former is a strums-and-strings soft-rock ballad; the latter a mellow midtempo plodder with a White Ladder electronic intro. Then again, perhaps Pond's vocals employ some sort of sinister code: ""In complete dark-NESS/ I lose ba-LANCE,"" he somehow rhymes, shortly thereafter referring to ""mor-NING."" And just try playing it backwards! ""Heard it's modern to be stupid,"" Pond intones on opener ""Halloween"". Modernly, on the subsequent ""So Much Trouble"", he adds, ""I don't think I wanna think about it."" All the while, his eminently competent band's glossy four-four thrum could just as easily back the newest from Josh Rouse or Joe Pernice. ""Concepts are embarrassing,"" Pond intones with pinched throat over staccato guitars. But whoa-oh-oh, sleepy ""Is It Safe"" dips a toe into the topic of, could it be, sex: ""We'd slip behind the pool and go with nature/ We'd lie beside the chlorine bottles."" Um, OK? So maybe Pond really is just another ordinary-guy exemplar of the ongoing post-Coldplay adult contemporarization of indie, as his ordinary arrangements and ordinarier songs would attest. The catchiest among them is the wistful title track, on which Pond tells himself, ""I told myself not to remind me."" While ""Emblems"" scores classic rock points for possessing the title of the previous album, all you really need to know about Several Arrows Later is finale ""Devil in the Water"". Yup, this is the type of disc that would close with a hushed duet and ponderous ""it's over"" refrain. Creepy.","Ex-Philly resident, now transplanted to Brooklyn, offers his latest batch of restrained, polished pop.

Carpal Tunnel,Derek Bailey,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fd5e6ef959693202f8/1:1/w_160/9ea27cf6.jpg,2005-11-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/532-carpal-tunnel/,Tzadik,"As indicated by the title of Derek Bailey's latest solo album, the celebrated 75-year-old guitarist has recently been stricken with a case of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in his right hand, a condition which has left him unable to hold a plectrum. While the onset of such an affliction would likely have most guitarists-- of any age-- thinking about retiring to other pursuits, for Bailey it has simply presented another new opportunity to continue his lifelong exploration through the possible vocabularies of his instrument. Following his diagnosis, Bailey chose to forgo invasive surgery and instead, in attempt to ""find a way around it,"" began the slow process of teaching himself to play using his right thumb and fingers instead of a pick. And so it is that Carpal Tunnel, Bailey's first solo record since 2003's Ballads, comes to closely resemble a patient's journal, monitoring the progress of his self-prescribed therapy. The album contains six brief improvisations that were each recorded three weeks apart, giving the listener an unvarnished aural timeline of Bailey's development as he painstakingly masters his new technique. Understandably, this all makes for an occasionally hesitant and rather scrappy affair, but one that should prove to be a rewarding document for established fans (and, I guess, for physical therapists with an academic interest in hand injuries). The album commences with ""Explanation and Thanks"", something of an audio letter addressed to an unidentified ""Carol"", on which Bailey wryly explains the project and issues a preemptive apology for his ""desultory and inaccurate"" playing. Of course, given Bailey's legendarily idiosyncratic playing style, very few listeners will be able to detect exactly which of his eccentric notes the guitarist considers to be inaccuracies. Throughout his career Bailey has exhibited a unique ability to simultaneously treat the guitar as both a familiar and an alien object. And with its tracks liberally seeded with his characteristic atonal, non-idiomatic digressions, pick or no pick Carpal Tunnel proves him to be incapable of sounding like anybody but Derek Bailey. On this opening track, as well as the following ""After 3 Weeks"", Bailey's playing is slow and methodical, stroking out one note at a time like he's dropping pebbles into a jar. Each of these early tracks opens with a similar Eastern-tinged figure, with his crisp, dry tones sounding very close to the twang of a banjo or even a Japanese koto. As the weeks advance, he becomes audibly more assured in his technique, and by ""After 9 Weeks"" has begun to incorporate more electricity into his playing, using his familiar volume pedal to variously dissolve and sustain his carefully-chosen notes, and allowing ""After 12 Weeks"" to close the album out on a satisfied wave of feedback. Over the years, Bailey has famously professed an aversion to recordings of improvisational music, which seems somewhat ironic considering the dozens and dozens of available titles in his back catalog. And though Carpal Tunnel can hardly be considered the most essential item in this vast discography, it might well prove to be his most revealing work, as it seems the purest distillation yet of his musical personality: ornery, inventive, comic, and above all, persistent as the tides.","Latest from the celebrated 75-year-old guitarist closely resembles a patient's journal, as it monitors the progress of his self-prescribed Carpal Tunnel Syndrome therapy.

At the National Grid,The Bats,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49dea9e61561daa4f46/1:1/w_160/cd013157.jpg,2005-11-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1180-at-the-national-grid/,Magic Marker,"Kiwi-rock is difficult not to love. There is something about the gene pool of New Zealand's southern island that predisposes bands to longevity and likability. You look at pictures of bands like the Clean and the Chills and the Bats and the Verlaines taken throughout their intermittent multi-decade careers together and it's just evident that these are nice, honest people who love making music and would like for you to please listen to it if you have a sec. Thankfully, they've always made that easy as well. At the National Grid, the Bats' sixth full-length in 23 years and first since 1995, is immediately inviting, opening with some barely comprehensible studio banter and slipping into the floating, percussion-less twee pop of ""Western Isles"" almost by accident. Robert Scott's guy-next-door vocals invite you in while bassist/guitarist Kaye Woodward sings little ""doot-doo"" backing vocals and Paul Kean's bass comes in to give the song a rhythmic nudge quite casually, as though it just stopped by for tea and decided to stay for a few songs. The album slips into its groove on ""Horizon"", a bouncy slice of jangling indie pop with some nice, subtly tricky stickwork by drummer Malcolm Grant. From there the album endears through a mixture of acoustic/electric jangle and friendly jamming, the latter of which contributes the album's only real low points. The band's almost off-handed interplay is one of their major strong points, but fuzzy instrumentals like ""Hubert"" are just a bit too stretched-out and meandering to complement their more tightly composed brethren. It's a small concern given how many songs go in the complete opposite direction. ""Things"" rides a surging rhythm section, nudging Scott's melancholy vocal forcefully into your memory banks, while ""Single File"" is the Bats at their most psychedelic, with garage organ piping tinnily in behind the bubbling guitars and harmonies. In the 10 years since we last heard them on Couchmaster, the Bats have kept themselves busy, with Scott keeping the highest profile in a couple of fruitful reunions of the Clean, but they don't really skip a beat on At the National Grid. If anything, the album has more in common with their ultra-loose early albums, unafraid to slip into a noisy rave-up as they do at the end of ""Flowers & Trees"" or just explore a jam for a few minutes. The approach doesn't make for a perfect album, but it's a lovely one nonetheless.","First new LP since 1995 for the slow-moving New Zealand vets.

Leave Them All Behind,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a857c0084474cd0c0de9/1:1/w_160/7355cd9e.gif,2005-11-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2101-leave-them-all-behind/,Modular,"In the battle to be crowned this year's Official DJ Mix for Indie Kids-- aka the Erlend Øye Award-- the frontrunners have already been set. In the first gate, the pop diva of choice for American hipsters, spinning a mix of Norwegian compatriots and remixed indie superstars, it's Annie! (5:3) Running in the adjacent lane, sometimes beatmaker for 2005's other underground diva M.I.A., he's already been on the indie-mix radar with his Hollertronix and Favela sets, the man who wears winter coats even in sweat-hot clubs: Diplo! (7:2) But is there a dark horse in the running? One glance at the tracklist stats for down-under label Modular's Leave Them All Behind, and you've got to be thinking upset: Death From Above 1979, Cut Copy, the Fiery Furnaces, Bloc Party, even crossover du jour the Killers. All bands on the precipice of being solid indie-friendly dance music, just looking for the right remixer or laptop jockey to gently coax out their inner discotheque. Given the proper presentation, it's a lineup that could easily become this season's go-to cheat sheet for indie-dance night DJs. Of course, this is because all the bands listed above are first-and-foremost rock bands, as is pretty much everyone in attendance on Leave Them All Behind. Rock bands taking enthusiastic part in the current boom industry of new-wave revival, sure, and rock bands given club-ready makeovers by electronic sympathizers like Mylo and Phones, check. But the mix's crossover potential is based on the prevalence of guitars and drums throughout, gently holding the rock kids' hands and showing them the disco lights. Most of the remixes included are pretty stellar, with the producers (Freddie Prinze Jr.) drawing out the hidden, all-that rhythmic beauty of wallflowers (Rachel Leigh Cook), like tracks from the Rakes and the Kills. Cut Copy and Phones, each of whom revise two tracks here, both have the uncanny Midas-like ability to make everything they touch sound like Duran Duran, a worthy demonstration for any and all re-enactors of the early 80s. The effect is powerful enough to help Midnight Jugganauts overcome their disastrous band name on Cut Copy's retooling of ""45 & Rising"", good enough to bring Bloc Party's ""Banquet"" to the kind of limbs-akimbo fervor their album only fleetingly reached. However, a mix is more than just the sum of its component parts, and, surprisingly for the label that first brought us the Avalanches, this facet is where Modular falls behind its competition. With its extremely uniform tracklisting (""we have both kinds of music: disco-punk and dance-punk!"") the opportunity is there for some AP collaging, but transitions throughout the mix are largely of the fade-in/fade-out variety. Songs start to bleed together more convincingly by the mix's latter half when housier Mylo and Jagz Kooner remixes pop up, but intriguing-on-paper transitions like the Fiery Furnaces' ""Single Again"" into Tom Vek sound disappointingly like nothing a plug-in couldn't handle. Especially galling is the presence of the Killers' ""Mr. Brightside"", not out of some ""what is this mainstream bullshit doing here?!?"" kneejerk tantrum, but because it's not moree integrated into the mix. Surely the track could've been put to better use than sitting isolated at the end of the album, looking suspiciously like mere shrinkwrap sticker bait; as the best top 40 single to come out of the new new wave thus far-- and with a quite good Jacques Lu Cont remix that could have been included-- it deserves better. Underdogs know they can't pull off the big upset by playing it safe, and the Killers' quarantine is just the kind of move that dooms Leave Them All Behind to the second division. In the final tally, Diplo and Annie's mixes sport too much more diversity in their selections and much more creativity in presentation, whereas the narrow focus of a genre snapshot like Leave Them All Behind almost necessarily handcuffs the final product. So, sorry Modular, no Øye Award for you this year, but take heart: It's an honor just to be nominated.","Modular's indie DJ cheatsheet features Death From Above 1979, Cut Copy, the Fiery Furnaces, Bloc Party, and others.

For Screening Purposes Only,Test Icicles,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ad13d19756521396e8/1:1/w_160/28ea566a.jpg,2005-11-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8304-for-screening-purposes-only/,Domino,"Feeling Nosferatu vibes this Halloween week? Dig Test Icicles: The UK trio is hard, fast, and viciously catchy, but above all scary. Guitars don't chug and wail; they whinny and scream. Carnival organ gallops ghoulish frequencies on ""Pull the Lever"". ""Catch It"" is just a scrambled nightmare with a psychosexual thrust. Yup, it's about the most chilling thing going next to Skateboard P's verses. But the band puts some jaunt to its haunt, namely in frontman Sam Merrann's vocals, which are dynamic but uniformly hair-raising. For those who think acid-throated vox are the province solely of American bands like Blood Brothers, here's a Brit who would give any stateside howler a run for his money in a Drano-drinking contest. The vocal venom sits well on opener ""Your Biggest Mistake"", whose distortion-eaten guitars call, respond, and scorch the earth. Elsewhere, the singer proves versatile, carrying subcutaneous melodies and bratting-up his quieter spit. When the band's slash-and-burn post-hardcore finally yields beautiful hooks, the screams can be corrosive. Merrann serves up Carengie Deli portions-- ample multi-tracking and agile trade-offs ensure no measure goes unaccompanied by voice, no lyric unechoed by a scream, and no guitar kick unaccented. But havoc and harmony learn to coexist, most harmoniously on ""Circle Square Triangle"", whose guitars punch thick upbeats despite an ungainly note count. ""Pull the Lever"" takes a rare indrawn breath, then spits the album's silkiest (and sickest) chorus. So obviously the boys have tools like a baby LeBron. But are their acrobatics more catchy than contrived? The lead singer's fucking nicknamed ""Dangerr,"" and the band name is one of the worst this side of Panic! at the Disco. Next you're gonna tell me Test Icicles play lipstick pink guitars and claim 15,000 Myspace friends. Without the übertight chops and huge choruses on 24-hour call, those facts might matter. Instead they're harmless gimmicks, more easily ignored than derided. For development's sake, the band ought to call Frenchkiss, which has this kind of slanted and chanted dance-punk all but vertically integrated. Screening Purposes would benefit from more voluminous production, especially on a song like ""Your Biggest Mistake"", which packs several fast-moving parts into a shallow sonic field. The effect is disorienting, like trying to focus on a single buzz in a bee-box. The more linear numbers have a better sense of equilibrium, but the straightest-- ""Catch It,"" which cuts a robotic beeline, and ""Maintain the Focus""-- are the least musically compelling. After a torrid opening sweep, the record starts to unravel, connecting its component dots rather than synthesizing them. Fifty minutes-- with only a gauzy organ-droning interlude for a bathroom break-- is a cross-country haul with a record that's all forte, all the time. But the hooks stick long after windedness wears off. Though the single's called ""Boa vs. Python"", Test Icicles are all cobra. Quick-tempered and ready to pounce at the drop of a double-time bridge, the band splits the difference between cockney, cocked neck, and coq au vin. The total package suggests a less test-icicular, dancefloor sympathetic Glassjaw-- which means show-goers would do well to train hard and eat a big pasta dinner before hitting the parquet. But asking the band to slow down would be like ticketing Tony Stewart.","UK trio boast acid-throated, Blood Brothers-like vocals and a delightfully hook-filled, slash-and-burn post-hardcore sound.

That record was one of the freshest, most unique statements the punk or hardcore scene had seen in years, and it brought on a great deal of disappointment when the band disbanded almost immediately afterward. Lyxén wasted little time before returning with The (International) Noise Conspiracy, and although it's worth giving him credit for trying something new rather than simply recycling his old band's style, this new project retained little of the excitement and fire that he'd so recently shown. The (International) Noise Conspiracy have continued to release albums, slowly growing in popularity, and they even scored involvement from big names like Rick Rubin, Benmont Tench, and Billy Preston on their most recent effort, 2004's Armed Love. But, much like Refused's early work, the band suffers from being too derivative. Their garage rock'n'soul sounds too meticulous, too calculated. The authenticity, the swagger, and the sex is missing. Unbeknownst to many, however, The (International) Noise Conspiracy hasn't been Lyxén's only output since Refused bit the dust. In 1999, he began recording as the Lost Patrol, releasing an album of political themed folk songs called Songs in the Key of Resistance. Now, six years later, what was once merely a solo project has grown to a full band (hence the slight name change) and released its self-titled full-band debut (Lyxén's third overall). Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the disc suffers from the same symptoms that have ailed most Lyxén releases: It's unoriginal, uninspired, and uninventive. The style may be different, but the song remains the same. This time around, Lyxén has focused his sights on the new wave and power-pop styles of the late 1970s and early 80s. Tight guitar hooks, doodling moog melodies, and catchy, sing-along choruses practically smother the life out of the disc. Two songs stand out: Opener ""Feels Like Drowning"", a toe-tapper that recalls the Raspberries and the Knack, and ""Pick Me Up"", a subdued, straightforward pop song that uses the synthesizer and a simple, compact beat to drive the verses and jangly guitar for the choruses. Elsewhere, there's not enough to set the tracks apart. ""Golden Times"", ""Hanging On"", and ""Let Me In"" are all rushed and essentially interchangeable. ""Get Ready"" and ""Can't Stand the Quiet"" are generic new wave. None of them are complete failures, but none offer anything to get excited about either. The album's one obvious blunder is ""My Heart Is Still a Mess"", a ballad-esque tale of woe that oozes with forced sentimentality from the pervasive acoustic guitar to the wedding chapel style organ. It's a shame that a voice that was once a part of a band responsible for such a strong, original album now seems stuck in a cycle of rehashing decades-old styles. For a man who has put so much effort in being a revolutionary, Lyxén's music is about as status quo as they come.","New wave and power-pop revivalism from the leader of Refused and the (International) Noise Conspiracy.

Radio Pyongyang: Commie Funk and Agit Pop from the Hermit Kingdom,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a821ea9e61561daa5748/1:1/w_160/c7f6734e.jpg,2005-11-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2047-radio-pyongyang-commie-funk-and-agit-pop-from-the-hermit-kingdom/,Sublime Frequencies,"The latest batch of Sublime Frequencies releases ratchets up the series' fuzzy but omnipresent political backdrop, with collections of music from two-thirds of Bush's ""Axis of Evil"" (no music from Iran, yet) in addition to another volume of pop from Myanmar. Among other things these records reverse the vague perception that lands with tyrannical governments and tight media control cease cultural production; in spite of politics, they say, music somehow finds a way. This assemblage of music and radio transmissions from North Korea is in some respects the most intriguing Sublime Frequencies set so far. The Korean peninsula undoubtedly has a rich tradition of folk and pop music, but none of that is on display here. For the last half-century in the North, tradition has been subjugated to the ""functional"" art ordained by party leadership. This music is a propaganda tool with songs relentlessly cheering on the glory and accomplishments of the state and, above all, promoting the unimaginably grandiose personality cult of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. By all accounts Kim Jong considers himself an aesthete; he is said to have a personal collection of 15,000 films or more, and in the '70s he had South Korean director Shin Sang-ok kidnapped and brought North to produce dramas infused with the correct sort of propaganda. Even under the rule of his father, Kim Jong-il took a special interest in the country's cultural output, reportedly writing several operas. At this point an entire nation's output of music more or less proceeds according to the tastes of one man. Radio Pyongyang was assembled and edited by Christaan Virant from store-bought tapes, short wave recordings from Voice of Korea, television programs, and live performances taped while he traveled as a tourist. Opening with the ""Motherland Megamix"", Radio Pyongyang confirms that, as with the military, the popular music of North Korea doesn't square with the reality of crushing poverty and a population frequently on the brink of mass starvation. The production is positively enormous, plush as one of the great leader's palaces, with mass choirs drenched in reverb exploding forth from the speakers to praise their benefactor. As a purely sonic spectacle, Radio Pyongyang fascinates like the lobby of a top-drawer Vegas hotel. Styles are all over the map, with frequent operatic touches, a heavy Eastern European influence courtesy of the political leadership's obsession with Stalin, syrupy enrichments of folk melodies, bizarre show tunes, and homegrown responses to Western pop. Virtant's quick-cut editing on the ""Megamix"" gives the music the flavor of a prog-pop suite, with military bands banging into sweet female vocalists cheerily singing along to a polka beat. And then six minutes in a frighteningly sanguine chorus is interrupted by a static-ridden blast from one of North Korea's numbers stations, a grim reminder at the diseased and dark heart beating at the core it all. It's pure kitsch, obviously-- a peculiar mix of crude militarist bullying and Lawrence Welk without budget constraints-- but Virant's brilliant editing keeps an ominous thread running throughout. It's a disorienting ride; unlike other Sublime Frequencies releases, which come to celebrate the sometimes accidental genius inherent in every country's throwaway pop culture, Radio Pyongyang seems like a running critique of itself, sheepishly letting the guilty pleasures of runaway nationalistic fervor bubble up even as it reminds us how frightening the whole enterprise is. On the one hand it's music made down the barrel of a gun, but on the other, you imagine the individual people making it, who probably wound up in these jobs because they love to sing or play. Every contradiction imaginable is happening at once throughout Radio Pyongyang and there is layer upon layer to unpeel. I don't know where the music comes from or what the songs mean, and certainly some of this stuff is laughable, but in spite of it all this CD is a weirdly fascinating work of art.","Sublime Frequencies comp was assembled and edited by Christaan Virant from store-bought tapes, short wave recordings from Voice of Korea, television programs, and live performances.

Because hey, your parents may hate the laptop grinding, but Brooklyn noise is all Woodstock these days; warm and fuzzy's the new old norm. Except, not exactly. Carlos Giffoni, Venezuelan collaborator (Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, Chris Corsano, Nels Cline, etc.) and show-thrower extraordinaire (No Fun Fest), has more on his mind than either holding hands or making ears bleed. Clocking in somewhere between Japanese/RRRecords brutality, John Wiese granular ADD, and cuddly States Rights laptop love, Giffoni has shown up ready to synthesize and bridge gaps. That said, don't expect to put this on at bedtime. The least exciting but default mode of Welcome Home is big morphing computer riffs, such as opener ""Welcome Home"", full of buzz-saw high end and an infinite sea of hiss and click. While intricately patterned/planned, only the most patient and masochistic of listeners will find much home in the antagonistically barren opening stretch. But then comes ""Bushwick"", glitching, pulsating, head-nodding, rhythmic and full of adrenaline-- a song worth an album alone. Giffoni finds the human urge buried in the sound (in this case, a primal satisfaction of cascading rhythm) and brings it to the fore. Sometimes he's even able to do this for his own machines: ""The Bold & The Mad"" revs so out of control, moving first way up and down and then (even more improbably) side to side that it actually gets itself sick and has to crawl right out of the frame. In contrast, the digital carnival of ""Who Is Home?"" is entirely human, working as a question that provides its own answer. Over 12 tracks, Welcome Home's rootlessness looms, a potential shipwreck on the shores of ones and zeros threatening to leave the listener searching for something remotely familiar to grab and hold. Well, this track is safe harbor. The cracked carousel melody is as much a home as any hideaway, built of warm tones ground up and bathed in, the sound inviting and impossibly soft. Even as Giffoni starts breaking it up, he does so with a trilling birdsong of an interruption, and when the granular wash does comes back, it is shockingly without malice.

Hangable Auto Bulb,AFX,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cdb1335d7bf16980e2/1:1/w_160/ca22e786.jpg,2005-11-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/239-hangable-auto-bulb/,Warp,"In a recent Mojo feature on Bob Dylan's 100 greatest songs, Frank Black talked about his attraction to ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"". What Black loves about the song above all are the drum fills at the end of each verse. This is where Black looks for the most powerful emotions on Blonde on Blonde, and he says that those fills can have him close to tears. Black's response popped out for me because the idea of ""emotional"" drumming resonates and yet you don't see mentioned often. Rare is the music where the percussion does this sort of lifting, but when it happens, the effect is striking. Richard D. James' single greatest talent may be his ability to program drums that convey feeling. He's always had a gift for melody and texture, obviously, but how these components work against his drums is what I'm always listening for. Which is, perhaps, why I've never much rated Selected Ambient Works Vol. II. To me it sounds like only half the Aphex Twin picture. In 1995, James' music was climbing along a Moore's Law curve, one release after the next filled with strange and adventurous sound that made the future of electronic music seem terribly exciting. In October, a few months after the release of I Care Because You Do, Warp put out two limited vinyl singles titled ""Hangable Auto Bulb"". These 12-inches featured James' first experiments in pairing his unusual melodies with stuttering, chopped, jungle-influenced drum programming, which wound up defining his sound in the second half the 1990s. Both releases were limited and have been widely sought by collectors since; 10 years later Warp has released both together on CD. James was fond of percussion that didn't even pretend to sound like real drums. The spastic taps going through the title track sound like a pair of scissors banging on a metal desk, with no timbral body to speak of. But the failure to reference proper instruments (or even previous digital approximations) gives an extra squeeze of the ""alien"" quality noted by so many attempting to describe James' style. Then on ""Wabby Legs"" the drums are constantly sent into a roll so fast they are transformed into another kind of instrument, a highly tactile buzz that seems to breathe. When this sound duets with a real or imaginary thumb piano as the track comes to a close, another aesthetic plateau is reached and the music's place in time becomes fuzzy. ""Custodian Discount"" is the only track that makes obvious use of ""bass"" part of the drum'n'bass equation, with a huge balloon of low-end bouncing between the finely cut beats. In general James was too obsessed with balance to let the bass dominate. The swooning, half-sick synth lines that overlap on ""Laughable Butane Bob"" hint at the classical sensibility that would be tweaked and brightened on The Richard D. James Album the following year, while ""Every Day"" brings the tunefulness even further forward with a hypnotic distorted synth ""singing"" lead. Everything here is memorable and at eight tracks over 34 minutes Hangable Auto Bulb leaves you wanting more. Compared to how hectic James and others would get with the drill'n'bass template, Hangable Auto Bulb is very restrained-- serene, even-- despite beats that can never stop twitching. The drums throughout seem strangely alive, full of energy but fallible, ready to take off at the slightest provocation. That tension, between the otherworldly yet effortlessly tuneful melodies purring along beneath drums that constantly struggle to frame them, is what the ensuing era of James' music is all about, and Hangable Auto Bulb is a hell of an intro.","Warp reissues Aphex Twin's the 1995 HAB EP and 12"" together as one eight-track package.

New Whirl Odor,Public Enemy,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14e9d034d5c69bf291d/1:1/w_160/5866811a.jpg,2005-11-02 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6503-new-whirl-odor/,Slam Jamz,"Hip-hop's aging process can be a real bear. How these men and women are siphoned of their meaningful juice after the age of 32 is a mystery. I have no answers for this. Rock and r&b; stars make comebacks all the time, proving force into their thirties, forties, beyond, and debunking over-the-hill-isms. Rap, eh, not so much on the revitalization tip. Rakim, LL Cool J, Marley Marl, Kool G Rap, et al-- titans the lot of them-- seem incapable of conjuring the fire they had in their youth. It's baffling. Public Enemy, a group so long on importance they have actually become hyperbole ipso facto, have struggled for more than 15 years to make anything as resounding as their first three albums. Their newest record-- with the stupendously stupid title New Whirl Odor-- opens with the same sort of blustery black-conscience quote that marked previous albums. Instead of Dr. King or Bobby Seale, they have employed the booming bridle of Rev. Al Sharpton-- a telling move clearly bound to questions of relevance. Quickly, a familiar voice, the at-attention roar of Chuck Ridenhour booms. ""I smell a new whirl odor! I smell a new whirl odor."" As a punny Maytag commercial, this is genius. As rapt political commentary it's lacking depth. PE is a group the world direly needs right now. Not simply as culture police or Karl Rove rovers-- and not to combat bling technocracy -- but to enliven dialogue, keep it in check maybe, but mostly to play social ping-pong. Paul Wall and PE should have fun together. Sniping is for suckers. Throughout the album, Chuck D often goes all Bill Cosby on us: Over the cheap Casio production of ""Makes You Blind"" he raps: ""Radiation of a radio TV movie nation/ On yo Goddamn mind, makes you blind!/ You don't matter, and they don't mind/ Cause these be the things that make you blind."" Gah. There's a fine line between deflating institutional bullshit and a curmudgeon's condescension. PE fell prey to the latter years ago. Musically, the album is sorely missing the Bomb Squad's Jenga-stacked whirlwind compositions, replacing the Shocklee Brothers and Eric Sadler with Squad utility players Johnny Juice and Abnormal. It's not all bad, just mostly copycat stuff. Most of the songs start with that familiar blitzkrieg intensity. ""MKLVFKWR"" and ""Preachin' to the Quiet"" in particular slam through at the outset. It quickly becomes clear, however, that there's not much variety in these producer's repertoire. A song like ""Night of the Living Baseheads"" has so many elements, it's like getting dragged through a mine field every time you hear it. By contrast, here we get ""Makes You Blind"", the worst metal song of the year. Maybe the decade. Chuck needs to stop this fixation right now. Professor Griff needs to stop rapping, too-- his flow is broken. It's no fun disliking this album, but it's no fun to listen to, either. If you align yourself with Public Enemy, you'll be thrilled with all the shouting and sloganeering. But that's precisely what they should be combating: homogenization, t-shirt politics, musical uniformity. Instead they get closer to Fiery Cover Band status. The cracks really start showing when the phrase ""Power to the people cuz the people want peace"" starts to mean nothing. What could once move the crowd, now just sounds empty.","Latest comeback attempt from the hip-hop legends.

Lapland,Craig Wedren,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aabc13d1975652139abd/1:1/w_160/848112fa.jpg,2005-11-01 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8809-lapland/,Team Love,"Craig Wedren and Team Love? Dubious. The label's feel-good aura seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured Craig Wedren we know from the glammed-up D.C. post-punk of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around lyrics like ""A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"" fit in with the Willy Masons of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the teen-angst alt-folk pie? Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. punk scene, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most unique music. After releasing several terrific records of haunting, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer Adam Wade and the inimitable guitarist Nathan Larson, signed with Epic, and released the career-defining Pony Express Record. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and Wedren's voice was exquisite, sliding frictionlessly between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest his elliptical poems with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated 50,000 B.C. didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores away from dissolution. Wedren's kept busy messing around with his arty pop band Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since Lapland features songs that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off film contributions, it's the Wedren project that most obviously begs for comparison to his old band. Make no mistake-- Lapland is a mainstream pop record; ""One Man's Heart"" and ""Do You Wrong"" were co-written with Jimmy Harry, who's penned songs for Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. Even with the poppier, more accessible turn Shudder to Think took with 50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these charming but strictly MOR pop ditties. So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The good news is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, Wedren's voice sounds terrific, an expressive and formidable instrument. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains striking. If most of the tunes on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as incidental music for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of ""Do You Harm"", for instance, and the various times on songs like ""Wanna Drive?"" and ""Fifteen Minutes Late"" when Wedren's voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, chilly upper regions of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for its unapologetic softening, and new Wedren fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop.","Team Love debut from the former leader of glammed-up D.C. post-punk band Shudder to Think.

Little by Little,Harvey Danger,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c069ea9e61561daa7bf3/1:1/w_160/77f2c0a6.jpg,2005-11-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3753-little-by-little/,Phonographic,"Calm down, you haven't accidentally time-warped to 1998, and no, this isn't Michael Ian Black giving you another dose of ""I Love the 90s"". After a five-year hiatus and even more time languishing in obscurity, Seattle quartet Harvey Danger have returned, not too sick but not too well. One-hit wonderdom does funny things to a band, as evident when Harvey Danger's street cred was forever damned upon that first sardonic verse ""I had visions, I was in them, I was lookin' into the mirror."" Ya see, these brainy college cutups, with their cheeky puns and witticisms, were simply too smart for their own good, and against their will, ""Flagpole Sitta"" catapulted them infinitely higher than expected on the cultural totem-pole, almost to the point of absurdity. The interesting thing about the band's first two albums was how they tip-toed around the 90s monoliths while sampling their shticks at the same time; noisy but not Nirvana, geeky but not Weezer, quirky but not Pavement, raging but not against machines. In other words, throw your 10 fave 90s indie albums in a blender and poof!-- Harvey Danger. Unfortunately, Little by Little wobbles without these coeval moors (Weezer's dead to me), leaving us with delightful vestiges though ultimately sounding like a Ben Folds album. I guess it's in some holy scripture that indie artists gotta go soft by age 35, but Little by Little's lack of fuzzy axes is heresy. Pop-punk gem ""Cream and Bastards Rise"" throws us a smart-ass bone, but the band leans a bit too heavily on tickling the ivories. All ""Eleanor Rigby"" staccato and self-pity, cathartic opener ""Wine, Women and Song"" makes the most sense of the sedated bunch as singer Sean Nelson apparently comments on his 15 minutes of fame: ""Wine, women and song/ I've tried them all it did not take me long/ To figure I'd unlocked the door to happiness/ I figured wrong with a capital 'R'."" Problem is, Nelson's wrenches his gut to the point of emo, ceasing the whole peanut gallery sniping that's separated these guys from, say, Primitive Radio Gods. ""Little Round Mirrors"" and ""Diminishing Returns"" lay on the sap and sweeping choruses, building to anti-climactic lines like ""You love all your little round mirrors/ See yourself reflected in one/ There's a hole in the middle you can't seem to fill"". When I heard the Danger was back, I prayed for a great anachronistic, Rip Van Winkle-like record adding yet another wrinkle to the band's outre act. Instead, Little by Little (save two or three tracks) reads like a carbon dating test, displaying the band's decaying sound gradually assimilating with its exhausted surroundings.","Seattle one-hit wonders aim to make a Nada Surf-like pop-punk comeback.

Kensington Blues,Jack Rose,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a324ea9e61561daa4bef/1:1/w_160/0894b774.jpg,2005-11-01 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6952-kensington-blues/,VHF,"The (apocryphal) outline of Jack Rose's game runs something like this: Ragtime and ""jass"" were bequeathed to him by the last words of Dr. Chattanooga Red, a mysterious mentor who allegedly told Rose to ""not let the ragtime die, and to bring it into the 21st century""-- twin missions that produced Rose's 2003 homage to his teacher, Opium Musick. True or not (not), it's a nice story, and the myth does seem operative-- Rose often plays as if the health of ragtime rests on his shoulders alone. Maybe it does. John Fahey and Takoma Records are gone, and Rose's modern compatriots (Ben Chasney, Kevin Barker, Sir Richard Bishop, etc.) are increasingly seduced by the East, by psychedelics, and by a ""freak-folk"" that owes less to American Primitive than it might claim. Although Rose is no stranger to the raga form-- or to the near 20-minute composition (2004's Raag Manifestoes had both of these in spades)-- his tools are firmly those of the past. While the new century's novel folk has already seen significant definition, Rose is largely alone in talking new century ideas with the old language. Thus, Kensington Blues is derivative and at the same time nearly brilliant. The styles Rose employs are diverse: twelve-string virtuoso shows, a slide guitar that alludes as much to the sitar as to the blues, solid traditional Takoma ragtime and folk. Out from latter comes a Fahey cover, ""Sunflower River Blues"", which (not surprisingly) works as the soil from which the rest of the record grows. The original was predicated on Fahey's impeccable timing; Rose's take amplifies the feeling and melody, and then runs with it. Hence the stunning ""Kensington Blues"", a song full of clarity and syncopation, elegant and well composed. Two others, ""Rappahanock River Rag"" and ""Flirtin' with the Undertaker"", are less weighty, more jaunty deliveries of Rose's signature modern ragtime. But Rose is more than a traditionalist, and the other tracks on Kensington Blues veer sharply into newer territory. ""Cathedral et Chartres"" uses twelve strings to abstract the melodic clarity so abundant elsewhere on the record, speeding it up and then sending it into a droning, buzzing finale. This idea is fully worked out in his closer, ""Calais to Dover"", in which Rose transfigures the raga into a kind of Dream Music, deep listening project, vibrating his way past individual notes and sequences and arriving at something more akin to pure tone and texture. The minimalist affinity is no coincidence: Rose's folk is not the least bit free, even as he explores freak sonic terrain, and control is his technique, no matter how many notes he stacks.","Seeking inspiration from John Fahey's Takoma Records, Rose attempts to drag ragtime into the 21st century.

Non-Stop Je Te Plie en Deux,We Are Wolves,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aabaea9e61561daa5c2b/1:1/w_160/0b8f43a3.jpg,2005-11-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8807-non-stop-je-te-plie-en-deux/,Fat Possum,"We Are Wolves certainly aren't the first wolf namesakes in indie (or in Montreal for that matter), but they may actually sound the most lupine. While many theories exist on this naming peculiarit, no other ""wolf"" band adheres to as many definitions of the word. Dictionary says ""one that is predatory, rapacious and fierce"", check; ""A harshness in some tones of a bowed stringed instrument produced by defective vibration"", check-plus, something's sounding harsh here; and ""A man giving unwanted sexual attention to women"", check infinity (the album title translates to ""Non-stop I fold you in two""). Not to kickstart the Montreal hype machine yet again, but Non-Stop is the kind of unique mid-stratum album that substantiates a ""scene"" as something more than two shit-lucky bands from Anytown, USA. That said, We Are Wolves sound nothing like Arcade Fire or Wolf Parade. The trio treats their jittery dance-punk like a mad science experiment, haphazardly fusing club-ready basslines with uncomely electronic raucous. While Non-stop adheres to Devo's school of mechanical, futuristic garage rock, there's a stronger, dehumanizing emphasis on instruments rather than melody. The main victim of this dynamic, Frontman Alex Ortiz, sounds trapped in a cyborg factory, screaming and yelping to no avail over analog beeps and buzzes. Opener ""Little Birds"" uploads the infectious octave riff of ""My Sharona"" into the Matrix, eschewing fun and lechery in lieu of Orpheus-style precision. Ortiz's indignant howls try to instill some human emotion though helplessly merge with the song's inescapable noise phalanx. ""Vosotros, Monstruos"" (Spanish for ""You, Monsters"") further flaunts the band's multilingual skills, yet musically these cosmopolitans take a cue from French techno. The track's purring carburetor bass recalls Vitalic's ""My Friend Dario"", and with the wise omission of vocals, the track creatively wanders, unfettered by structure. Although such techno via dance-punk via noise arouses the genre insurgent inside us all, the band's minimalist attitude occasionally strands them in an electro no man's land. ""La Nature"" comes packed with ideas but bewildered in aim. Refusing to follow a gradual techno swell or establish a smug high-hat jam, the song simmers but never boils as each individual component sounds completely self-contained from the other. Still, these guys are a nearly ideal reincarnation of bands like Dance Disaster Movement or Numbers, hedging their sonic volatility with playful 8-bit melodies. Oh, and did I mention they're from Montreal? ","Sonic volatility and playful 8-bit melodies from another Montreal ""wolf"" band.

Plaintive acoustic guitar weeps a line of Frankensteinian despair, too weak to cry, while a monastic chant implores us, ""awaken."" This is not the same Family who welcomed us into its hovel last spring, and whose infectious bonhomie salved a disorientingly unfocused album. After that murmur of an opener, it can only be nap or nuke. ""Moment"" goes the latter route, blindsiding those who came for the pastoral folk with a dizzying free-punk mortar blast. What? This match-made-in-enchanted forest oozed possibilities, but barrel-rolling drums, cold Unwound harmonics, and soaring off-key anthems were not in the cards. Nor was a simultaneous expansion and focusing of scope. The band embarks with eyes open wide, but by centerpiece ""Future Myth"" they're practically bulging out of their sockets. Two minutes of crescendoing chords, mimetic glockenspiel, and twittering synths simulate the sunrise we never got. The six ensuing ticks fold in climactic guitar riffage, a horn biting Sufjan biting Glass, and at least one surprisingly adroit hip-hop beat. Akron/Family's debut was a potluck affair-- more trash than treasure, multifariousness its biggest appeal. Low-lying nylon-strung verdure cohabited the same space as vocal powwows, a move straight out of the Neutral Milk Hotel gratuity bible. But the neighbors rarely spoke until now. Drippy with the band's wonted choral free-for-all and syrupy back-porch bends, ""We All Will"" shifts but doesn't rift. ""Dylan pt. 2"" circles back to ""Market""'s bombastic drums without dropping later-established threads like the twang slang. In positioning for climax, the band sets up imminent disappointment. Stripped of expectation, then, ""Raising the Sparks"" is a surprising power stroke. Pinned by snare/tom stomp, a glitzy guitar harmony does its best Steely Dan as the song stampedes ""na na na""ing into the night. Akron/Family love looping simple melodies and patterns ad infinitum, but the repetition is seldom epicentral; instead, it's space for their orchestral fog machine to fill. Backing Gira on his five-song set is a much different drift. Instead of hazes we get lines, instead of drum circles, studio snares, as the band services its patriarch's works with sure-footed reverence. Gira's originals play second banana, occupying the record's back third. Dylan's ""I Pity the Poor Immigrant"" is rendered drunk by the crooner's loopy lower registers, Akron kicking a listless shuffle. ""The Provider"" builds off creeping metallic upbeats and consonant strings create a quicksandy murk over which Gira towers, never sinking. His star backing band even comes forward for a final surge, somehow managing to understate ululation. None of the tracks are more noteworthy than anything on Sing ""Other People"", Angels' latest and straightest LP, and the foreshortened format disables development. But Gira's fatherly measuredness is a nice foil to Akron's hyperkinetic mini-opera-- at this point, he may be overparenting, but damnit they'll thank him someday.","Young God head Michael Gira teams with his signees and backing band for a split LP.

Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow,Guided by Voices,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfcaeb335119a49ed2a2/1:1/w_160/d6e1ada3.gif,2005-11-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3601-suitcase-2-american-superdream-wow/,Fading Captain,"In addition to the phalanx of regular Guided By Voices releases, bandleader Robert Pollard issued the four-disc box set Suitcase in 2000. Filled with tapes of home-recorded demos and unreleased songs, it was a lower-than-lo-fi trip through the underbelly of the band's overwhelming output. Suitcase 2 picks up where the first Suitcase left off, documenting and releasing a seemingly bottomless trove of unreleased Pollard tracks. Even the art on the spine stretches across all four discs: You'll listen to all four in their entirety and you'll fucking like it, says Pollard. A few things that anyone who's given a shit outside of Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes will care about: The wonderful packaging, and a newer batch of outtakes extending to 2005 post-breakup material. Where the original Suitcase box was full of behind-the-scenes photos and fawning journalists' quotes to convince you that GBV was the most important band ever, this one does away with the context entirely. In the Watch Me Jumpstart documentary, Pollard describes sitting in the back of a high-school art class, creating cover art and band names long before Guided By Voices had been fully realized. Suitcase 2 makes that daydreaming concrete: Every panel of the booklet and CD is a sleeve design for Skag or Bug-Eyed Mums or one of the other never-were bands credited on Suitcase 2. The box is scattered, as expected, but the songs collected go a long way to indicate that, contrary to popular belief, Pollard has a measure of control over his songwriting. As the author of an estimated 5,000-plus songs, it's easy to see him as beer-swilling savant, committing everything to tape with no regard to quality. The Suitcase boxes indicate that he is not only a diverse songwriter, but a keenly self-aware one as well. The demos from Isolation Drills in particular stick out, showing how consciously Pollard had changed his style and what a weird record Drills is-- songs like ""Headache Revolution"" and ""Daughter of the Gold Rush"" come fully-formed with an undercurrent of melancholy. Older pre-band tracks are steeped in the shadow of 70s rock radio, but songs like ""It's Only Up to You"" are rare chances to hear Pollard sounding vulnerable. Not everything works, like the ridiculous western accent on ""Lonely Town"", and there's more heaving than singing on ""My Dream Making Machine"", but the elegiac ""Two or Three Songs"" actually pulls off the navel-gazing, and the rallying call of ""no trash at all, I'm gonna throw it all out"" from ""Sacred Space"" shows he's conscious of the process at the very least. Sure, there are extraneous instrumentals, and some of the inebriated fun is more inebriated than fun (""The Golden Pickle"", ""Zarkoff's Coming""). Pound-for-pound, song-for-song, it doesn't live up to the first box, but Suitcase 2 provides the same kind of thrills and spills as its predecessor: blow-the dust-off gems that poke our anthropological pleasure centers (""Stingy Queens"" is another unearthed burst of brilliance from the aborted The Power of Suck concept album), the gleefully raucous (""Bye Bye Song""), the cast-offs (""Tainted Angels and Butter Knives"", later issued under its working title, ""Jason Lowenstein's a Wanker"") the don't-fits (""I Am Decided"" was recorded for Under The Bushes, Under the Stars sessions and was so good Kim Deal had to steal it for The Amps' only record), the alternate versions (""Paper Girl"", ""Proud and Booming Industry""), the songs-in-progress (""Rocket Head"" is a hilarious embryonic ""Teenage FBI""; ""Sacred Space"" would become ""Office of Hearts""), and a rambling answering machine message (""What About The Rock?""). Curiously thrown in are outtakes from Pollard's first solo record, Not in My Airforce, further blurring the line between where Pollard stops and GBV begins. One Pollard criticism can't be deflected here, however-- Pollard's peak was the mid-1990s, culminating with the Under the Bushes sessions, when he was ridiculously prolific and consistently inspired. ""Stingy Queens"" and ""I Am Decided"" tower over most of the material here, and the Not in My Airforce demos, recorded near the same time, hold their own against the few outtakes from the band's back-to-back acknowledged classics (""You're Not the Queen Anymore"" alone reps Alien Lanes). The hiss-covered early tracks are way more fun than any myth-building behind-the-curtain ephemera should be, and the Isolation Drills demos show he could shift and change, but the mid-nineties material is what's worth going back to. But I've always felt that the tape experiments and ramblings are more an inclusive joke than an annoying distraction, and a laugh is better than a half-baked melody. The problem isn't that the four discs are too much; the thing that's really fucking infuriating is that if you spend the time, you will find those scattered brilliant songs. It's not that Pollard's releasing trash or writing too much for his own good, it's that only a very few highly organized and highly devotional non-family members can hope to keep up with him.

The Lake EP / Hope There's Someone EP / You Are My Sister EP,Antony and the Johnsons,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b75e6ef95969320256/1:1/w_160/1c11b098.jpg,2005-11-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11655-the-lake-ep-hope-theres-someone-ep-you-are-my-sister-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Since the ascent of Antony's I Am a Bird Now, critics have progressively focused their attention on the New York City vocalist's physicality, often with weirdly aggressive cheap shots. The hook: Big guy with angel's voice. Live, wearing a black Mascis wig as camouflage, Antony does tower over his bandmates, but the body police fail to note that his physiognomy renders the gender play so much more exquisitely plaintive because, well, there just aren't many women that tall. And despite his colorful backstory, it seems time to drop the two-bit caricatures and puff pieces and return to the brilliant, unearthly voice that earned Antony his accolades in the first place-- his three most recent singles offer a good place as any to instigate a frequency shift. Functioning as Antony 101, The Lake was released three months prior to I Am a Bird Now. Offering a glimpse of things to come, the cover image is a detail from Peter Hujar's 1974 photograph ""Candy Darling on Her Deathbed II"". Musically, it opens with a studio version of the title track, Antony's Edgar Allen Poe jam. The song appeared in a live version on Golden Apples of the Sun and was initially found on the Current 93/Antony 2003 split Live at St. Olave's Church EP. ""The Lake""'s studio version, however, features Kevin Barker of Currituck Co. on guitar and Antony regular Julia Kent playing cello. Compared to the earlier configuration, it's crisper and a tad slower with more pronounced instrumentation-- especially Barker's crystalline chords. Next comes ""A Fistful of Love"", a jazzy, horn-heavy stomp beginning with a spoken intro courtesy of Lou Reed. This paean to rough sex/love nicely prolongs Poe: ""The Lake"" is an adaptation of an Edgar Allen poem and Antony sings on Reed's The Raven, a concept album about the soused 19th-century author. The EP closes with ""The Horror Has Gone"", a lilting ballad that finds Antony in full vocal tremolo. Kent's cello again rallies the beauty around Antony's piano, drums and what sound like female backing vocals (though I was assured by label folk that's it's actually Antony layering himself into tizzies). The lyrics inject some hope-- ""I found my baby/ I lost my bird and I know it seems crazy/ But now I feel we were one""-- but Antony's exquisite performance-- and the macabre final flourish, in particular-- tempers the cheer. Keeping his aesthetic thematically tight, the Hope There's Someone EP opens with the title track, a piece about the fear of dying alone, among other things. (The death rattle is supplemented with a bed-ridden video directed by Glen Fogel and starring Joey Gabriel. A still from the video is used as the cover art, connecting it to Candy Darling.) The other two tracks are previously unreleased recordings from the I Am a Bird Now sessions. The strongest of these-- and one of Antony's best-- is ""Frankenstein"", a full-on love song complete with gothy gospel-esque choir. The most stirring moment occurs when Antony goes a bit Aretha-- ""When I was a young boy, my mama said you better watch out for your fall, but now that I'm a grown woman/ I know I know I know""-- accompanied by rollicking, beautifully recorded drums. The finale, ""Just One Star"", feels like a minute-and-a-half clipped from some Broadway musical, Antony crooning along to his ivories: ""I am just one star, born of grace and soon to die, but if i can just learn how to love then I could live."" Continuing to find bridges between each single, the last few notes echo a moment from ""The Lake""'s piano line. The recently released third EP pairs ""You Are My Sister"", a moving duet with Boy George, with three more unreleased songs recorded during the Bird sessions. ""Poorest Ear"" fits and starts, but never flows, ending with ""Little Drummer Boy"" snare and Antony's approximated Riverdance. Fortunately, ""Forest of Love"" is more successful. Sung from the perspective of a five year-old girl, the narrative follows her requests for the return of her brother from all sorts of possible evils. It begins gorgeously, but lacking Antony's usual effortless magic it plods into vaguely new age territory: Its saving grace is the description of the landscape, teeming with water snakes and trees. Both ""Forest of Love"" and ""Poorest Ear"" rely too much on Antony's voice and not enough on solid songwriting. Missteps are forgiven, however, upon hearing the excellent final track, ""Paddy's Gone"". Stripping accouterments for spare piano and multi-tracked voice, Antony presents a heartbreaking three minutes of ecstatic barbershop quartet; he careens within himself variously (""Paddy's gone for a long time/ Love that man/ Scared without him""), and like the dusky vocal variations of Elliott Smith's ""I Didn't Understand"", it could loop for an hour and still hold my interest. Since I reviewed I Am a Bird Now last February, the album's grown even more astounding to my ears. In that sense, it's legitimately intriguing to yawn through some of these non-album stinkers. But hell, Antony's human-- I was starting to think of him as some kind of perfect, enraptured Downtown deity.","In the wake of You Are My Sister, we round up Antony's three most recently released Secretly Canadian EPs.

Trill,Bun B,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49cc0084474cd0c051b/1:1/w_160/964edb27.jpg,2005-10-31 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1179-trill/,Rap-A-LotAsylum,"Bun B is a powerful rapper even when he isn't saying anything. His voice has a hypnotically fluid precision and a weary authority, and Bun delivers his rhymes with enough inventive eloquence to even make street-rap clichs sound fresh. His latest album, Trill, is full of solid, workmanlike beats from guys like Mr. Lee and Mannie Fresh, and only occasionally succumbs to mainstream rap's fetish for pillowy r&b; sonics. Bun is comfortable working a lot of different styles, from the pitbull threats of ""I'm a G"" to the catchy plastic fake-Miami bounce of ""Git It"". As a slapdash multiple-producer singles-and-filler album from a B-list rapper, Trill succeeds; there are certainly many, many worse ways to spend your rap money. But here's the thing: It's not enough for Trill to be a competent mainstream-rap album. It's the first solo album from Bun, and it comes at the first bright moment of an epically long career. Bun is half of the Texas duo UGK, a group contracted early in its career with Jive, a label that had no idea how to market it, and still hasn't managed to extricate itself. And so the group's albums never sold what they should've. But UGK's underground fanbase was strong enough to drive its 1996 release Ridin' Dirty past gold, and Bun and his partner Pimp C made what should've been a career-making guest appearance on Jay-Z's ""Big Pimpin'"" in 1999. Unfortunately, the duo's follow-up album took too long to come out, and it never managed to capitalize on either of the duo's career landmarks. In 2001, Pimp C went to prison for violating his probation, and the group looked dead. But Bun responded by going on a tear, making ridiculously cold guest appearances on virtually every Southern rap album to come out in the last two years, and he managed to build his name up more than he ever had in UGK, especially after Houston rap blew up huge earlier this year. This should be Bun's moment, the light at the end of the tunnel, the time when he steps up and delivers the genre-defining classic he's always promised. Instead, he's made a pretty good rap album. Trill is not a well-sequenced album; every transcendent moment is immediately followed by an embarrassing travesty. ""Pushin"", a gorgeously sad drug-talk reminisce with Scarface and Young Jeezy, comes immediately before the irredeemably cheesy squeaky-synth Jazze Pha collaboration ""I'm Ballin'"". The triumphant all-Houston posse cut ""Draped Up (H-Town Mix)"", which includes the ecstatic surprise of Chamillionaire and Paul Wall appearing right next to each other, is followed by ""Late Night Creepin'"", and inexplicable collaboration with the guy from the Transplants who isn't Tim Armstrong. But the most egregious misstep comes right after ""The Story"", Bun's crushingly honest and endlessly fascinating retelling of the entire UGK story. On that track, he raps for six minutes straight with no hook, uncovering every inside detail of his tremendous career. It's one of the best things Bun has ever done, but then its momentum is halted by the following track, the tedious and awkward r&b; love-rap ""Hold U Down"". And so the album goes, derailing its great moments with sad missteps. Bun wastes guest appearances from Jay-Z and Young Jeezy on the ungainly, uninspired track ""Get Throwed"", and on ""Who Need a B"" he gives us the spectacle of a middle-aged married man talking explicitly about pimping. And so Trill, for all its strengths, is a missed opportunity. Bun probably still has another classic on the level of Ridin' Dirty in him; we might find out a couple of months when Pimp C goes up for parole and maybe returns to crafting the woozy soul tracks that Bun loves.","Long-suffering Houston rapper and one half of UGK gets help here from Mannie Fresh and Mr. Lee.

Harmonies for the Haunted,stellastarr*,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a642c0084474cd0c0903/1:1/w_160/619b28a6.jpg,2005-10-31 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7716-harmonies-for-the-haunted/,RCA,"Harmonies for the Haunted seems as familiar as Stellastarr's 2003 debut, and that's at once its chief cincher and problem. Two years ago, when Brooklynites Stellastarr* turned up fresh out of art school in the wake of Interpol's Turn On The Bright Lights, the foursome seemed considerably less like copycats and more like the lesser of two partners-in-crime ripping off New Wave big names. Both debuts resembled soundtracks to somber dance parties, but Stellastarr*'s had crappier lyrics, and Amanda Tannen's sweet hollabacks.* So Harmonies for the Haunted is nothing new; it'd be easy enough to nail the band for repeat offense of poor-man doubling. But they're first-rate mocks-- as deft as dead-on cover bands come. Virtually all the LP's tracks flaunt role models plainly, but they draw from even fewer sources this time around. ""Lost in Time"" already plays uncannily reminiscent of the Cure's ""Closedown"". ""Sweet Troubled Soul"" is Bloc Party's ""Helicopter"" for drama kings who fancy their queens sweet and troubled-- ""I want to suffer in your arms/ And when you're naked in the dark/ I want to see your face in the reflection of my bedroom stereo/ We'll take it slow."" No room for jokester Kinks shit here-- especially since Christensen's pipes are Ric Ocasek's gone through two extra rounds of puberty. Bitter singles going door-to-door caroling on Valentine's day would sound something like ""Damn This Foolish Heart""-- dissolving into earnest rounds, all while Christensen's crying ""no no no no."" Speaking of histrionics: ""Love and Longing"" and ""When I Disappear"" channel the All-American Rejects-- picture lead singers' eyes closed, belting ""I won't regret you."" Christensen's puppy dog wails seem as recycled as the music itself. Even the Rejects camouflaged better. But Harmonies kinda seduces, anyway; ""Lost in Time"" sheds some light on why: ""I tried to say/ I miss you tonight/ And they claim you've already died/ But the truth is that we're lost in time."" Here's a P.S./Birth-type set-up: Mostly-dead lovers getting uncannily resurrected as sweeter, younger things, but way less metaphysical.","On their second album, these Brooklynites still come across as Interpol's lesser partners-in-new-wave-crime.

Speak for Yourself,Imogen Heap,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1865e6ef9596932370d/1:1/w_160/e012a75d.jpg,2005-10-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4025-speak-for-yourself/,RCA,"One minute, she's auditioning for a spot in a Curve cover band, doing her best to convincingly sulk and pout. The next, she attempts to out-cloy every AOR merchant of schlock with a Lilith Fair ticket stub in their jewelry box. Throughout the rest of Speak For Yourself, Imogen Heap nervously flits between these two poles, envisioning a world where Sarah McLachlan, Shirley Manson, and Björk do each other's hair and sing into hairbrushes. The results of this musical terraforming are at once both gorgeous and bland. It's not for want of trying, though. Heap actually mortgaged her London flat to finance the making of this record, and the go-for-broke attitude is evident. This record is produced within an inch of its life, sounds on top of sounds topped off with a gauzy candy-coated sheen that's, at times, too much to bear. Ornate baubles like ""Clear the Area"" and ""The Walk"" threaten to collapse under the weight of all their finery. Most of the tracks are a sticky-sweet conglomeration of piano and other sparking sounds-- synth air rushing in, Dopplered voices fading away. Sometimes these sounds are abetted by fuck-off guitars (like ""Daylight Robbery"") or big-beat drum machines (like ""I Am In Love With You""). Invariably, most of the tracks find a samey safe spot between the unrepentant Nelly Furtado-esque chirping of ""Goodnight and Go"" and the maudlin yearning of ""Just For Now"". And then there's Heap's voice, an ephemeral elastic thing that more often than not disappears into the music. It's hard to believe that someone executing these vocal gymnastics can also evaporate so easily. Sometimes, she gets lost within her own songs; sometimes, she gets lost within her own round-robin multi-tracking trickery. The pouting on ""Daylight Robbery"" is as loud as she gets, and even that's soft as silk. More often than not, the listener is caressed with whispers and sighs and innocuous vowels-as-words attached to lyrics that are often as airy as her vocals. There's also Heap's tendency to indiscriminately toss in those little yelp-sighs that some singers (hello, Ms. McLachlan) lean on until it turns from ""charming affectation"" to ""offputting tic"". Having said that, there's no reason why this album can't be the subject of a torrid aural love affair. Her ostentatiousness is endearing, if you can swallow both the musical and vocal flourishes. And when Heap's personality shines through all the trappings and inadvertent emulations (somewhere before the chorus in ""Goodbye and Go"", for example), it's a welcome breath of fresh air. And it's not like the songs are bad. They're just too much, and pity the fool with no patience for pretty frou frou stuff listening to any of this. The black sheep of the bunch, ""Hide and Seek""-- aka That Song From ""The O.C.""-- best exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of this album. The track consists of nothing but a Vocoder and her voice singing stuff about crop circles and sewing machines. It's gorgeous, it's impressive, it's grandiose, and it's barely there at all-- just Heap's voice darting and divebombing, making itself scarce, disappearing into itself.","Go-for-broke record filts between Curve-like sulking and Lilith Fair-like emoting.

Celebration,Celebration,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a748b1335d7bf1699003/1:1/w_160/701731cd.jpg,2005-10-30 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1821-celebration/,4AD,"Celebration's Katrina Ford makes Polly Jean Harvey sound like Sandra Dee, and you're not going to have much use for her band if you can't get with her swooping, mewling, grunting, cooing, slurping, yawping, yipping, trilling, whooping howl. Like Nina Hagen, Ford has the technical skill to sing anything she wants-- opera, cabaret, rock, whatever. And like Hagen, what she wants to do is to wail out unhinged, demented werewolf gurgles free of structure or accessibility. In short, she's a potential deal-breaker. Celebration is the fourth band Ford has started with her husband, multi-instrumentalist Sean Antanaitis, after Jaks, Love Life, and Birdland. The couple seem to change their band-name every time they switch collaborators, and now they've found a new guy in drummer David Bergander. More than any of Ford and Antanaitis' past bands, though, Celebration seem to exist entirely to allow Ford to go as nuts as possible. Antanaitis and Bergander create off-kilter Halloween funhouse tracks, all spooky whistling organs and busily shuffling drums and unbalanced time signatures. And Ford uses the tracks as launching pads, unleashing her voice in all its glory. It's stunning and virtuosic, but it's not especially emotionally resonant. Celebration are probably best-known for theur association with TV on the Radio; Ford sang on ""Staring at the Sun"", and TVOTR's David Andrew Sitek produced Celebration. Sitek also plays on the album, and Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone provide vocals. TVOTR are probably also the reason Celebration are signed to 4AD. Celebration has little of TVOTR's melodic heft or cascading warmth; they simply expand on that band's warped, proggy intensity. And that fractured sense of grandeur serves Celebration well; the band sounds something like 4AD's entire catalogue being chopped up and fed through a meat-grinder, those glistening synths and ethereal harmonies and lilting whale songs agonizingly mashed into an ugly, Frankensteinian chamber-jazz. Nearly every track begins with a deceptively calm and fluid keyboard melody before slowly piling on more and more elements, becoming denser and more chaotic while Ford gets further and further from anything resembling pop music. It's a neat trick, one that stays interesting over the course of the album, but don't expect it to keep you warm at night.","4AD release from the fourth band featuring the swooping, trilling, whooping howl of Katrina Ford and her husband, multi-instrumentalist Sean Antanaitis-- the duo formerly behind Jaks, Love Life, and Birdland.

Into the Woods,Malcolm Middleton,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36cea9e61561daa7efa/1:1/w_160/acd6fbc9.jpg,2005-10-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5667-into-the-woods/,Chemikal Underground,"Relax, there are no Sondheim covers here (alas, no Sleater-Kinney ones either); instead, the second solo outing from Arab Strap's Malcolm Middleton verges on something even more surprising from a member of Scotland's slow-drunk-fuck-folk duo: happiness. Of course, the feeling is mostly superficial, manifesting in jaunty melodies and bright acoustic guitar as Middleton burrs morosely about more-typical Strap fare-- loneliness, insecurity, cursing-- and it doesn't last. Yet Into the Woods shows Middleton's growth since 2003's awkward 5:14 Fluoxytine Seagull Alcohol John Nicotine into a witty, self-effacing, and eager-to-please singer-songwriter. The troubadour Middleton most resembles is fellow happy-sad Glaswegian Gary Lightbody. ""Loneliness Shines"" leans on Snow Patrol's gussied-up-MBV noise squalls, while ""Choir"" picks up Final Straw's search for the hugely, glisteningly anthemic in fragile personal details. Reindeer Section's Jenny Reeve even guests on the catchiest track, ""A Happy Medium"", an all-grins jolt of jingling dance-floor folktronica. ""My face is a disease,"" Middleton spits out incongruously. It's such bitter lyrics that distance Into the Woods from Lightbody's bands. On ""Autumn"", Middleton addresses the season as ""you fucking cunt"" over gloomy piano straight from Gary Jules' rendition of ""Mad World""; ""Burst Noel"" recounts a Christmas spent watching ""EastEnders"" all alone after getting knifed. Middleton tends to indulge in songs about songs, which, like reviews about reviews, can be either a crutch or a coup, depending on execution. Splashy opener ""Break My Heart"" plays this game fairly well with lovelorn pop's eternal catch-22: If the girl doesn't break the singer's heart, she'll ruin his career. It's hard to fault the song's gamely cheerful piano and upbeat tune, and it's easy to envision crowds lapping up its nice-guy sweetness. Amid finger-picking, clouds of distortion, and Celtic strings, ""Monday Night Nothing"" makes a more pedestrian self-reference, as Middleton confesses, ""I don't know how to finish this song""; by the Notwist-esque electro-pop of ""Solemn Thirsty"", dude's speaking teen-romance-movie: ""How do I write a song and give it to the girl?"" Then finale ""A New Heart"" pokes fun at itself and Arab Strap's well-documented profanity by neatly dodging dirty rhymes. None of this explains Middleton's bear fixation (a number of the species' representatives rear their heads throughout the album), but why quibble? In the ultimate sensitive-singer-songwriter move, Middleton depicts himself as a guy who's just looking for the perfect girl but can't seem to find her.","Second solo outing from Arab Strap's Malcolm Middleton is colored by jaunty melodies and bright acoustic guitar.

Closing In,Early Man,by: Cory D.

As someone who grew up cranking Kiss and AC/DC, I'm instantly leery of any band that relies too much on irony and kitsch when playing this style. Perhaps as an attempt to curtail those concerns, the one-sheet that Matador sends along with two-man metal band Early Man's debut full length goes to great pains to make the band seem authentic. As much space is devoted to describing their gear as the band members themselves, one of whom sports a Kreator t-shirt in a recent press photo. It felt like they were trying a little too hard. There's even a quote about how Conte only uses a standard tuning ""mainly for the sake of pissing off the nu-metal world."" Let the music speak for itself, guys; especially when it works this well: For everyone who misses traditional, heavy rock, Early Man has come to assure you that you aren't alone. Closing In is a classic guitar-driven heavy metal record. It's a throwback to early 80s thrash, the era before speed often became a substitute for creative ideas. Every song is built around galloping riffs and booming power chords. The album's opener, ""Four Walls"" sets the tone with explosive chords giving way to a crunchy, palm-muted rhythm. The chorus, which layers reverb-sodden, call-and-response vocals with a catchy guitar lead, is one of the strongest on the record. ""Death is the Answer"", which also appeared in a slightly different form on the band's self-titled EP issued last summer, begins as a bludgeoning, Sabbath-esque metal-march, with echoing vocals and lyrics revolving around the crowned prince of heavy metal, good ol' Satan himself, before picking up the tempo midway through. The album's primary weakness is its uniformity. There's only so much that can be done with mid-tempo, riff-driven metal, but the album is well-paced, with strong tracks sprinkled from start to finish. ""Like a Goddamn Rat"" appears at the midpoint, and its hi-hat heavy, almost-dance beat just begs for some serious head nodding. On ""Evil Is"", Conte trades in his smooth croon for a gruff Kill 'Em All-era Hetfield-esque bark to great effect. Younger listeners who are looking for artists comparable to the newer, speed-and-fury style acts that cover the metal landscape may be turned off by Early Man's old-school vibe, as will anyone looking for silly theatrics and camp. But as someone who still appreciates the keep-it-simple-stupid attitude of classic 70s heavy metal, Closing In is a resounding success.","Debut LP from Matador's two-man metal band is a throwback to early 80s thrash.

Their Law: The Singles,The Prodigy,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13d13d19756521385a1/1:1/w_160/233fde97.jpg,2005-10-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6487-their-law-the-singles/,XL,"Liam Howlett fittingly called his ""group"" the Prodigy, even if everyone in the U.S. only remembers the guys with the Union Jack shirts and bonsai haircuts. In America, they enlivened an 18-month stretch of our lives with frat electronica, surprising no one when they disappeared forever. In the UK, they were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1990s, epitomizing a whole mess of sociocultural malarkey. That they can be both is a big chunk of Howlett's ""genius,"" and Their Law is the kind of all-killer/no-filler collection that only someone with half an eye on the avant-garde and the other one-and-a-half in the gutter can produce. Early Prodigy tracks are a bit like chasing your Lucky Charms with chocolate milk. ""Charly"" sampled a kiddie safety PSA along with an oompah-loompah synth riff and, in England, went all the way to No. 2. ""Jericho"" and ""Everybody in the Place"" speed headlong like crash test dummies on runaway breakbeats. Best-ever Prodigy track is ""Out of Space"", which throws Max Romeo and Kool Keith into the back of a Jeep while Howlett does donuts in the shopping mall parking lot. Personally, I could never part with all of the malformed, day-glo vinyl mutants from the early days of rave, but for the rest of you, their Experience album will work a treat. Howlett quickly saw the writing on the wall for the one-hit-blunder dance single as a career-- as well as sensing the pop limitations of the underground (which probably wouldn't have him anyway). The result was the 1993's Music for the Jilted Generation. Suddenly, the former clown prince of pacifier rave was being hailed as an auteur, ditching the squeaky voices and writing a quasi-concept record about the Criminal Justice Act. *Jilted has taken a bit of a reverse drubbing in recent years from * Experience partisans as a cheesy ""maturation"" move. But the singles are still great, chewy with cornball menace, though not quite as over the top as those of a few years later. Guitars make their first appearance on a Prodigy record here, on ""Their Law"", and ""Voodoo People"" and ""Poison"" are hairy, greasy cousins to ""proper"" techno. Best of all is ""No Good (Start the Dance)""-- jungle in slo-mo replay. 1997's Fat of the Land went to No. 1 in the U.S., which prompted ad execs, record company PR stooges, and Spin to foolishly presume ""electronica"" was poised to clean house in the floundering final days of alt-rock. ""Firestarter"" sounds like Trent Reznor in one of his all-too-rare moments of self-aware humor, like the Bomb Squad at +5 with a pink-haired British bulldog bellowing about how tuff he is. ""Breathe"" is just ""Firestarter 2 (the Quickening)"", And then there's ""Smack My Bitch Up"", which divorced from its ""controversial"" video is a really good big beat track. And then...nothing. For eight long years. Finally, outta nowhere, came Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned in 2004. Maxim Reality and Keith Flint (the shouty ones) were MIA. It got panned, stiffed (at least in the states), and generally gave no indication that Howlett wasn't actually washed up. Maybe it's just surrounding context, but the Always singles on Their Law actually sound pretty darn good-- ""Girls"", especially, is awesome, like crunk IDM or something that sounds similarly awful on paper but comes out sounding like an air-raid warning on Howlett's laptop. Bonus disc edition is largely useless, a string of live tracks (eh) and B-sides (eh-to-hey-not-bad). Remixes range from ""why?"" (Audio Bully's take on ""Out of Space"") to ""holy farking hell"" (Pendulum's blitzkrieg drum & bass rework of ""Voodoo People""). Sadly missing: Their wind tunnel and WMD's remix of Method Man's ""Release Yo' Delf"" (second best-ever Prodge moment). But the main disc is satisfying like a 72-oz. steak or half a case of beer: Knowing you should know better just adds to the fun.","Career-spanning compilation collects singles from Liam Howlett's shape-shifting 1990s powerhouses.

Sliver: The Best of the Box,Nirvana,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40eeb335119a49ed868/1:1/w_160/75356b6e.jpg,2005-10-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5812-sliver-the-best-of-the-box/,Geffen,"In May 2002, Courtney Love bragged to Rolling Stone: ""I have the Holy Grail of rock and roll,"" referencing the already-legendary box of 109 unreleased Nirvana and Kurt Cobain demos, outtakes, and experiments. ""Not all of it's great,"" she admitted. ""On those tapes are everything from shitty collages to some pretty stunning, awe-inspiring acoustic songs to stupid, fucked-up shit."" In 2004, just in time for Christmas, bits from Love's infamous cache of cassettes appeared on the With the Lights Out box set, a collection of 61 tracks with a list price of $60-- the supposedly definitive postscript to Kurt Cobain's April 1994 suicide. Sliver: The Best of the Box is a pared-down version of With the Lights Out, adding three tracks that didn't appear on that set. Without getting too deep into shifty-eyed corporate conspiracy theories (the previously unreleased demos included here are said to be ""freshly"" unearthed), it's difficult to see Sliver as anything more than a sneaky swindle designed to aggravate Nirvana completists who already own the box set and don't otherwise require another non-self-compiled best-of. But no matter how much slack you're willing to cut Geffen, Sliver reeks of manipulative marketing. Granted, posthumous releases are always delicate ground-- publishing Cobain's private journals, for instance, made plenty of his followers squirm-- but this is excessive. What's worse, none of Sliver's three new songs are particularly revelatory or dynamic: The long-sought-after rendition of ""Spank Thru""-- which, strikingly, has never even been available on bootlegs-- is pure artifact, hinting at an embryonic Nirvana. While diehard fans are no strangers to the song itself (a later version appeared on the legendary Sub Pop 200 compilation, while 1996's From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah-- already the second posthumous Nirvana release-- featured a live cut), Sliver's version appeared on 1985's infamous ""Fecal Matter"" demo tape, and features a throaty, 18-year-old Cobain on guitar and vocals, backed by the Melvins' Dale Crover on drums and bass. Oddly, the quality of the recording is stellar in contrast to the rest of the album's material, and every vocal tic and nuance is instantly palpable. Still, complete with mid-song coughs and ridiculous electric guitar wrestling, ""Spank Thru"" was obviously never destined to hit record stores, and while it's an interesting anthropological bit (and a charming ode to jerking off), Sliver's melodramatic unveiling of the track is somewhat insulting to Nirvana's devoted legions. Sliver also offers a demo of ""Come as You Are"", supposedly recorded for Butch Vig in 1991 before he began working on Nevermind. Unsurprisingly, it sounds shitty, and nothing new or particularly interesting transpires in its four minutes. The most worthwhile of the three bonus tracks is a 1990 studio demo of ""Sappy"", a version of which appeared as an unlisted track on the 1993 charity compilation No Alternative. (The song, which had no official title on that disc, was often referred to as ""Verse Chorus Verse""-- even now, dissenters wrestle over which version of the song deserves which title). Here, it's studio-quality, and, though slightly more plodding than the No Alternative version, still a great track. Chances are, most Nirvana fans are hungry for rare and unreleased songs, not scrappy demos of singles or semi-absurd teenage wankery. Still, there is a bit of good news. As plenty of critics and fans agreed in 2004, With the Lights Out was overstuffed, curated without care, and bloated by poorly recorded, destined-for-the-recycling-bin demos and unflattering vocal portraits. Sliver fulfils its promise to cull ""The Best of the Box"" (see: ""Do Re Mi"", ""Old Age"", and a live ""Floyd the Barber""), and though it may be irritatingly superfluous, as a collection of B-sides, demos, and outtakes, it lives up to its subtitle.","This single-disc release pairs the highlights from the largely disappointing, 61-track With the Lights Out box with three previously unreleased songs.

Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec2abf31b7dc71561c8/1:1/w_160/23bc22b3.jpg,2005-10-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3351-schools-of-thought-contend/,Dim Mak,"From Monument to Masses' 2003 LP The Impossible Leap in One Hundred Simple Steps was an acerbic assault on political injustice, from the album's first track, ""Sharpshooter"" and its dissection of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, to ""To Z (Repeat)"", a disc-closing attestation to the nature of struggle and progress. The band relies on samples and sound bites to push its cause, weaving them into a dense fabric of instrumental post-rock that relishes the best aspects of the genre without falling into its all-too-predictable patterns. The songs are long and winding, but it's to their advantage, as they use the space and length to shift the mood and tone, bouncing at times through robotic rhythms, catchy melodies, and thick walls of guitar and bass. Now, more than two years later, From Monument to Masses returns with Schools of Thought Contend, which combines 13 collaborative interpretations and two new tracks to create a compelling companion to The Impossible Leap. The two new tracks continue in the style the band established and developed over the course of its first two albums. ""Deafening"" opens the disc with soothing guitar chords, bells, and violin droning over a tight high-hat and snare-rim beat. As with many of their songs, though, by the five-minute mark, the tone has changed, trading in the lush arrangement for stop-and-start rhythms and distorted guitars. ""The Noise Thereafter"", the other new track, appears toward the tail end of the disc. It's a much more upbeat affair, with math-rock-esque guitar noodling and a quick, galloping beat. It's definitely one of the more fun tracks these guys have done, and hopefully it's an indication as to where they're headed. The remixes are the bulk of the disc, and as with most remix albums, the successful tracks are the ones that take elements of the original and breathe new life into them. ""The Quiet Before"" appeared originally as a short, dreamy, bass-driven track with as much cymbal crashing going on as an actual beat. The Thunderbirds Are Now! remix, however, transforms it into a skittering dance tune, with cut-up snares and cymbals and high-pitched computer blippery for the first half, and lullaby-style bells and keys on the backstretch. The second remix of the track, done by Subtitle, skews and detunes the guitar, pushes the bass to the front, and uses it all as the backdrop for the MC's layered rapping. A third and final version, remixed by Amundsen, closes the album. This version strips even more from the original, turning it into a somber acoustic guitar and accordion piece, with the percussion reduced to spikes of static. ""From the Mountains to the Prairies"" appears here in two radically different forms. The first, the Norr Liva & AM remix, mutates the driving original into a haunting post-rock epic that's at times sparse and atmospheric, at times bombastic and intense. The Textual remix takes tiny bits of the original, such as single-note guitar strumming, and layers it with 808 drum machine beats and warbling bass, in essence transforming the song from rock to laptop IDM. For the most part, the more bold the choice made by the artist remixing the track, the more successful the result. Automato remixes ""The Spice Must Flow"" into dance floor dub in the same zip code as ""Funkytown"". Both versions of ""To Z (Repeat)""-- one each by 65daysofstatic and Last Defender of the One True Waveform-- push the levels into the red, upping the intensity right along with the mixing-board faders. But several tracks suffer from simply not having enough going on: Jason Clark's remix of ""Sharpshooter"" is too empty at times, and too similar to the original at others. Likewise, Antimc turns ""Old Robes"" into generic drum and bass while retaining little from the original. Even if it isn't enough to stand on its own, Schools of Thought Contend has a ton of strong, interesting, and exciting material. Its biggest drawback is the length. At 15 tracks, it's just too bloated, especially considering the source album only had seven. As a companion piece to its predecessor, Schools works, but without that support, it will probably find trouble standing on its own.","Dim Mak band weaves samples and sound bites into a dense fabric of instrumental post-rock.

Capture & Release,Khanate,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2913d197565213b261/1:1/w_160/c86461f4.jpg,2005-10-27 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4568-capture-release/,Hydra Head,"The mighty Khanate's been kicking around for five years, with previous albums on Southern Lord and Load plus a remix 12"" and a live CD and DVD. The NYC quartet's third and best full-length, Capture & Release, generally picks up where others left off, but in an extended, grimier fashion, pairing the 18-minute ""Capture"" with the 25-minute ""Release"". It's like a doom-metal opera; the Melvins possessed by Die Kreuzen. Capture & Release's most immediate hook is Alan Dubin's bewitched growl. On stage, the vocalist crouches and grips his microphone like a weapon (arms extended), face hidden behind his long hair. On record, filtered through headphones, he pounces and gnarls with taunts and warnings and disses-- ""You are blood/ Nothing more,"" etc. Dubin's backed by the guitar of Stephen O'Malley (Sunn 0))), Lotus Eaters), the bass and synthesized laptop effects (wind, gurgles) of James Plotkin (ex-Atomsmasher), and the heavily glacial Codeine drums of Tim Wyskida, who whacks toms as though willing arms to unhinge. The conductor, Wyskida's cymbal crashes function as dissolves into Dubin's next monologue; on stage, all the players watch him, and when they land at the same time, the room literally shakes. Because Dubin chants his libretto with vocal effects, it can be easy to misunderstand him. He opens ""Capture"" by shouting ""Who says I can't have?,"" but for a long time, I swore he was nodding to AC/DC and screaming ""Hell's Bells."" Which is better? Getting the lyrics right adds to the experience, but Dubin's scowl is so ominous you don't need to grasp each syllable to generate chills. The main storyline seems to be luring someone into a basement, strapping and tying them to something, and repeatedly letting them know that ""this is my house"" and they're ""one step closer to nowhere."" Moments where the drums pickup a bit (well, it's the speed of a log-jam) and the bass/guitar/vocals/and atmospheres collide in mid air that'll make just about anyone commence half-speed headbanging. ""Release"" opens with three minutes of dank dungeon atmospherics during which Dubin whispers, ""I've got a bone to pick/ Maybe it's yours."" Here death is the sole escape, so when Dubin continues ""I won't let go"" over cymbal sheer and clean guitar strums, he's promising an eternity of torture. For the final movement of the album, hell breaks loose: More guitar distortion, incrementally faster drums, choirs of feedback, chomping synth noise. Live, this is when Dubin pumps his fist in the air and the audience pisses their pants. A few nights ago I tried explaining Khanate to a friend, who said she didn't really get ""experimental metal"" or the way certain bands test their audience. I disagreed with the idea that Khanate (or other bands) are testing. Dubin and company aren't aiming for easiness, but they offer patient listeners the chance to burrow into a seductive cocoon, into a sound as chilling and ominous as a pool of black icebergs. After a healthy brainstorm-- the Cure and Current 93's ouevres included-- I can't think of a three-minute pop song offering a similiar effect.","Like a doom-metal opera, the NYC quarter's third and best full-length is like a more expansive, grimier version of its predecessors.

The Night's Bloom,Pinetop Seven,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0815e6ef9596931ff77/1:1/w_160/98e0d544.jpg,2005-10-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6306-the-nights-bloom/,EmpyreanBarbary Coast,"The title track from Pinetop Seven's fourth album, The Night's Bloom, begins with a murky overture that sounds like it's playing through an old Victrola-- distant, subdued, aged and dusty. At the song's 0:37 mark, though, the strings swell, becoming fuller and more detailed, as if a black-and-white film has suddenly erupted into Technicolor brilliance. This moment, which is the first of many unexpected sonic hooks on the album, not only sets the tone for the dozen songs that follow, but also reintroduces Pinetop Seven after a five-year absence, serving as a tangible transition from 2000's subterranean-dark Bringing Home the Last Great Strike to the more varied sound of The Night's Bloom. In that half-decade interim, the band has grown from being Darren Richard's more-or-less solo project into a collaborative ensemble that has cut its teeth on small tours and ambitious new scores for old silent films like The Wind and Laugh, Clown, Laugh. Those exercises have proved instructive: The Night's Bloom should place the band alongside Iron & Wine and Calexico as the best of bewildering and beautiful Americana. As if to live up to the sonic possibilities of the word ""bloom,"" the album is much more ornate than previous efforts: songs are dense with instruments, which intermingle in surprising ways. On ""Easy Company"", Nate Walcott's muted trumpet and Richard's vibraphone slink around Mack Hagood's piercing slide guitar and Andy Rader's circling bassline, and the effect is eerily noir, bubbling with tension and possibility. Snapshot-size fanfares herald ""Born Among the Born Again"" and ""A Mouthful of Expensive Teeth"", echoed in Richard's iridescent backing vocals. Melissa Bach's string arrangements-- played by members of the Chicago-based Quartet Parapluie-- add to the widescreen scope of ""Witness"" and the private heartbreak of the mournful ""Made a Whisper Out of Me"". This arsenal of instruments permits more intricacy and versatility in the arrangements, which in turn bolster Richard's vocal melodies and expands the songs' emotions into a full spectrum of grief, anger, desire, disdain, and horror. Still, despite the collaborative dynamic on The Night's Bloom (most of the string and horn arrangements are credited to cellist Bach and/or trumpet player Walcott), Pinetop Seven still feels like Richard's brainchild, with the music scoring soundtracks for the short films in his head. Setting his story-songs in the region Ray Bradbury once described as ""the October Country"" (""that country where it is always turning late in the year, that country whose people are always autumn people, thinking autumn thoughts""), Richard proves a confident storyteller who fully inhabits his hard-luck characters and knows precisely which details to disclose and which to withhold. His voice soars, but it does so solemnly, resonating with the intensity of a projector's arc light as he relates these black comedies of humiliation that evoke the tragedy of being someone else's fool. ""June"" (a cousin of ""A Black Eye to Be Proud of"" from Bringing Home the Last Great Strike) follows a couple on a fateful trek into the woods: I ""won't tell you what we did,"" the narrator says, ""don't know the word for it."" But he has ominously ulterior motives: ""They'll never look at me again that way."" Sung in the voice of a love-starved outsider who just wants to show a sympathetic woman ""what I'm capable of,"" ""A Page From the Desert"" is a murder ballad without the murder, and ""Witness"", with pop-song dee-dee-dee's illuminating its chorus, relates a story of petty revenge that builds to an ending worthy of Flannery O'Connor. Distinguishing between the band's music and Richard's lyrics, however, seems largely beside the point. As with any good soundtrack, The Night's Bloom derives its power from the interaction between sound and story-- how the racing-heart conclusion of ""His Aging Miss Idaho"" embodies the precarious intensity of love; how the quiet strings and unsteady vocals reinforce the intimacy of ""Made a Whisper Out of Me""; how the descending guitar triplets on ""Fringe"" mirror the whistled theme of ""A Page from the Desert"". All the elements intermingle with one another to put bloom on the night, and the result is perhaps the most evocative and sweeping realization yet of Pinetop Seven's particularly cinematic aesthetic.","Five years after their most recent release, Pinetop Seven grows from being Darren Richard's more-or-less solo project into a collaborative ensemble to file alongside Calexico as the best of bewildering and beautiful Americana.

One Kiss Can Lead to Another,Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d5b1335d7bf1699135/1:1/w_160/19688a25.jpg,2005-10-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1973-one-kiss-can-lead-to-another/,Rhino,"Utilitarian and condescendingly named, compartmentalized in its construction, and mostly voiced by supposedly interchangeable sets of teenagers, girl-group music has long been relegated to a footnote in rock's back pages. A large number of its songs are widely loved, of course, but to many critics and listeners, the peak of girl-group music (roughly 1962-65) is considered an era of frivolity and disposability, a manufactured post-Payola placeholder rightfully eradicated from the airwaves by the British Invasion. Granted, the girl-group sound was cynically designed to be ephemeral, the work of highly competitive yet mostly faceless songwriters working out of Brill Building cubicles. Little concern was given to artist development, and the singers themselves-- many of whom were black-- were rarely promoted as vigorously as their rock'n'roll progenitors, partially due to labels' fears that television performances would reveal their skin color and thus alienate potential listeners. The music, however, has persevered, even proving itself massively important and influential, despite its marginalization by an industry that mythologizes and profits from the past by lionizing larger-than-life personalities and/or album-oriented artists rather than pop singles. Rhino does its part to make amends for some of that marginalization with its lovingly compiled 4xCD, 120-track girl-group box One Kiss Can Lead to Another, a near-perfect combination of quality, necessity, song selection, sequencing, informative liner notes, and packaging. Crucially, the compilers were liberal with their definition of girl-group music, incorporating not just doo-wop- and/or gospel-influenced female vocal teams such as the Chiffons, the Shirelles, the Cookies, and the Shangri-La's but also combos and solo artists from a variety of musical styles, including R&B, garage rock, country, proto-psych, and Northern and blue-eyed soul. British singers such as Petula Clark, Sandie Shaw, Cilla Black, and Dusty Springfield are afforded places here-- as are, ironically, tracks made popular by Brit Invasion artists such as the Beatles, Hollies, Moody Blues, and Herman's Hermits. Familiar artists such as Cher and Dolly Parton appear in atypical guises, but most of the widely recognizable names are working behind the scenes: Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Brian Wilson, Neil Diamond, Jimmy Webb, Randy Newman, and Cat Stevens all feature in the liner notes, alongside Brill Building songwriting staples such as Goffin/King, Mann/Weil, and Barry/Greenwich. The most notable absence is Phil Spector, whose dense Wall of Sound production style and proclivity for melodramatic lyrics were the benchmarks and templates for much of girl-group music. But then, that's just as well, since anyone willing to purchase this affordable set will also want to own Spector's Back to Mono box, which includes the major hits by artists like the Crystals, the Ronettes, Darlene Love, and others. Of course, the inability to license Spector's tracks made it impossible for the set's creators to compile a definitive genre box; wisely, they instead cast a wide net and included mostly non-hits, unearthing a collection of tracks that will appeal to both girl-group neophytes and acolytes. Unsurprisingly, the most common subject matter on a set of girl-group songs is boys-- boys who lie and cheat, boys who drive a wedge between girls and their parents or friends, boys who feed off of dependency and low self-esteem, boys who trick girls into thinking it's love when it's lust. As the title implies, one kiss leads to two, two kisses can lead to three, and eventually it can lead to doing more than a good girl should. On One Kiss, it can also lead to rationalizing distress (the uncommon diet advice on the Fabulettes' ""Try the Worryin' Way""), long-lasting emotional scars (P.P. Arnold's ""The First Cut Is the Deepest""), becoming trapped in cycles of emotional abuse and dependency (Lesley Gore's ""What Am I Gonna Do With You?"", on which she guesses ""I'm just the girl you stay with/ To see what you can get away with""), and heartache (the Flirtations' Northern soul classic ""Nothing But a Heartache"", among many others). At its most extreme, one kiss can also lead to unwanted pregnancy (the Lovelites' ""How Can I Tell My Mom and Dad?"") and even murderous jealousy (the Whyte Boots' vicious girlfight in ""Nightmare""). Crushes entail risk, like an emotional choose your own adventure, but risks can also pay off, and it's that belief that colors many of the tracks. The heartache of the set's most melodramatic tracks is balanced by happy endings, improbably joyous and exuberant music, and the power of self-actualization and empowerment. It sounds quaint today, but a teenage girl building an identity, making her own choices, and gaining measures of self-respect were still largely new ideas in the 1960s. The protagonists here might make a lot of wrong decisions-- from the Shangri-La's lamenting their bad boy gone good in ""Out in the Streets"" to Evie Sands offering herself mind, soul, but mostly body on ""Take Me For a Little While""-- but simply having the opportunity to voice their thoughts or follow their hearts and minds are things their mothers couldn't sometimes do. This spirit is reflected in songs like the Chiffons' psych-tinged anthem ""Nobody Knows What's Going On (In My Mind But Me)"", the pent-up struggle between lust and loyalty in Elle Greenwich's ""You Don't Know"", Twinkle's death ballad ""Terry"", the What Four's sex-as-a-weapon track ""I'm Gonna Destroy That Boy"", and Wanda Jackson's sexually charged ""Funnel of Love"", each of which are revolutionary in their own quiet way. In the past 40 years the music featured on One Kiss has served as a touchstone for a wide variety of artists, most notably 1970s New Yorkers (the Ramones, Bruce Springsteen, New York Dolls, Blondie, Martin Scorsese), 1980s Brits (the Smiths, Jesus & Mary Chain, the Field Mice, the Cocteau Twins), and contemporary indie stars (Saint Etienne, Magnetic Fields, the Avalanches, the Concretes). We've even enjoyed a lengthy post-Spice Girls/Aaliyah resurgence of girl-group music via hip-hop/R&B, dance- and electro-pop, teen pop vets, and UK chart acts such as Girls Aloud and Sugababes. One of the saddest quirks of rock criticism is that the hopes, dreams, and fears of teen girls are frequently considered frolicsome fluff while the rage and defiance of teen boys is miscast as the articulation of free thinkers. And yet, it's the girls-- in part, because they're more likely to function as mouthpieces for adult songwriters-- who examine universal subjects such as love, romance, self-actualization, self-confidence, and personal politics, while young rock bands often simply reject growing up, fight responsibility, and wear that struggle as a badge of pride. Both approaches can work, of course, but unlike a sneer, a kiss never goes out of style.","This lovingly compiled 4xCD, 120-track box is a near-perfect combination of quality, necessity, song selection, sequencing, informative liner notes, and packaging.

Lookaftering,Vashti Bunyan,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46db1335d7bf1698966/1:1/w_160/98ee2d85.jpg,2005-10-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1136-lookaftering/,Fat CatDicristina,"It's been 35 years since the release of UK folk singer Vashti Bunyan's solo debut Just Another Diamond Day, which translates to roughly 240 years in music industry terms. And now, with the release of her second album Lookaftering, Bunyan has completed a comeback more reminiscent of pre-war country blues artists like Dock Boggs or Bukka White, whose performing and recording careers were resurrected during the 1960s folk revival, rather than anyone from the pop/rock era. Like those old folk and bluesmen, Bunyan returns to a musical landscape that's been unrecognizably altered. But unlike the later recordings of those performers-- which consisted primarily of reworking their older material-- Lookaftering represents the full-fledged reawakening of a still-vital talent, ready to cast aside her decades-long artistic hibernation and re-ignite her creative fires. At that time, after the small initial pressing of Diamond Day failed to find an audience, a disheartened Bunyan left the city and music behind, packing her wagon to quietly raise children and animals in the Scottish Borders and rural Ireland. In the meantime, however, her album slowly built a reputation as a lost classic. So when Diamond Day was reissued in Britain to great acclaim in 2000, Bunyan commenced her gradual return to the spotlight. Since then she's made cameo appearances on albums by such fans as Devendra Banhart and Piano Magic, and earlier this year partnered with Animal Collective on the charming Prospect Hummer EP. On Lookaftering, it comes as a relief to hear not only how pristine Bunyan's delicate vocals remain but that she has retained her understated abilities as a songwriter, despite going decades without picking up a guitar. Taking its title from a self-invented word that refers to taking care of something or someone-- as well as to the process of looking back on the past-- Lookaftering deftly covers both these themes in ample measure. In many regards, this collection seems a wistful, measured reflection upon the long-ago daydreams of Diamond Day and the sweet sadness of all that goes by, while managing to retain the same tranquil, out-of-time intimacy that has allowed her debut to age so gracefully. Lookaftering also features tasteful instrumental contributions from such guests as Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Mice Parade's Adam Pierce, but Bunyan's most crucial collaborator proves to be producer Max Richter. Throughout the album, Richter's impeccable orchestrations of piano, strings, and woodwinds (co-arranged by Bunyan) masterfully echo Joe Boyd's classic work with Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, and on Diamond Day; as well as Larry Fallon's chamber-folk arrangements on Nico's Chelsea Girl. As with Diamond Day, this careful balance is critical to the album's success, since Vashti's feathery, near-whispered vocals could be easily capsized by a heavy-handed production. ""Indifference is the coldest hand/ It is the wave that clears the sand,"" sings Bunyan on ""Turning Backs"", an exquisitely orchestrated track she has said was written with Nick Drake in mind, but that might also provide insight into the reasons behind her long absence. Her frustration with the domestic life also crops up on ""Wayward"", on which she describes ""days going by lost in clouds of flour and whitewashing,"" before later sighing, ""I wanted to be the one with road-dust on my boots."" Elsewhere, though, these songs look on the past with a shivery, almost tangible longing. ""Here Before"", is an elegant ode to the happy mysteries of parenthood (""Once I had a child/ He was wild in the moonlight/ He could do it all/ Like he'd been here before"") while on ""Against the Sky"" she depicts a city-dweller nostalgic for her old farmstead (""The hill behind the old house/ I can trace it with my finger."") For some listeners, such nostalgia might teeter uncomfortably close to sentimentality, but even on personal tracks such as the brief elegy ""Brother"", Bunyan keeps her touch impossibly light, reflecting only for a moment before quickly turning another page. Lookaftering closes with a wordless reprise of ""Wayward"", as she quietly hums the song's melody as though unaware that anybody might be listening. But, hopefully, with the arrival at last of her stunning second album, Vashti Bunyan need no longer worry about her music going unheard. ","In one of the most unlikely comebacks in rock history, Brit folk-pop singer Vashti Bunyan releases her sophomore album-- 35 years after her debut-- and still retains not only her pristine, delicate vocals but also her understated abilities as a songwriter.

The Past Presents the Future,Her Space Holiday,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0b7abf31b7dc71564e2/1:1/w_160/3c8e2d61.jpg,2005-10-26 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3828-the-past-presents-the-future/,Wichita,"Judging by Her Space Holiday sad guy Marc Bianchi's latest, the meeting of past, present, and future must sound like heart-choked whispers, stuttering electronic beats, and chopped orchestral do-do-dos. In other words, fifth proper full-length The Past Presents the Future is not much different from Her Space Holiday albums past-- and despite the promised future, the damn thing only plays in the present. OK, so it's a little different. Along with his familiar first-person woe-is-mes, Bianchi lends his flat Oberstian vox and sample-stocked laptop to several third-person tales. That means ""The Weight of the World"" isn't about the narrator's attempted suicide, but that of a disillusioned religious woman (""Rip those black beads off your throat/ Swap 'em out for a knotted rope""). Elegantly string-encrusted ""You and Me"" casts Bianchi as a shoulder to cry on, wondering ""how can so much good exist in such a tiny heart?"" rather than starring in his own romantic tragedy. Then there's ""A Match Made in Texas"", about a gender-bending couple (""He likes wearing her clothes/ She likes watching him dress""). The apparent setting-- Texas, whoa!-- may help the song's flaccid politics, but can't save a monotonous melody. On 2003's The Young Machines, stellar tracks like ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"" and ""Sleepy California"" made up for the rest. Here, unfortunately, the balance is reversed. Of Bianchi's missteps, the gravest are his efforts to harness catchy songs past for his present, ah, future. A bass line and ""1, 2, 3"" chorus straight from the Jackson 5 are boppily out of place on ""Missed Medicine"", with its bitter call to ""exploit our misery."" Then there's the all-time lamest Beatles reference in the history of lame Beatles references: ""Here comes your son/ Do, do, do, do/ Here comes your son/ He isn't all right,"" from ""The Great Parade"". And those songs are merely the obvious offenders. Checking phone messages is a chore, but Bianchi makes us listen to his twice. A friend's spoken ""Marc, you're leaving"" opens the album-- and, duh, scares the shit out of me, 'cause I drink too many espressos. On ""A Small Setback to a Great Comeback"", high-pitched ambient drones accompany an increasingly pathetic woman's voice (""I wish you were here just to hold me,"" yuck, cooties!). By the predictable acoustic finale, Bianchi wants to hold his family, too. Aww. ""Regret is like a bill unpaid/ It controls your every move,"" he adds, but I don't know what that means. My unpaid bills just pile up, silently cursing their puppeteering ineptitude. Bianchi's not much for such subtleties, emotional or rhetorical, which may suggest he'll have as much lovelorn electro-symphonic melodrama to recount on future albums as on those past and present-- unless of course time is just an illusion, in which case at least you haven't wasted any.","Heart-choked whispers and stuttering electronic beats from Marc Bianchi.

Cult Cargo: Belize City Boil Up,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84013d19756521395e7/1:1/w_160/f7c6e63d.jpg,2005-10-26 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2078-cult-cargo-belize-city-boil-up/,Numero Group,"Belize is not a nation that gets much attention from the rest of the world. A slice of Central America's Caribbean coast smaller than Vermont, it's a former British colony that only gained its independence in 1981. But Belize has a vibrant, diverse, and well-mixed culture that whips together influences and people from across the Caribbean, as well as Europe and Africa. The traditional dish of the country is something of a metaphor for its population: It's called the ""boil up,"" and it essentially involves boiling whatever's on hand-- whole fish, plantains, pork bones, pig's tail, whatever-- together in one pot. Taking things one step further, the boil up also serves nicely as a culinary analog to the country's musical output. Though it's a part of the mainland, Belize is essentially a Caribbean country, and its close ties to Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago are apparent on even a cursory listen to the limited recorded output of the local and ex-pat Belizean musical community. And of course, like any Anglophone country, Belize was hit by the soul and funk sounds of the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s. The exuberant embrace of all of these influences is excellently chronicled on Belize City Boil Up, the latest from Numero Group and the inaugural release in what figures to be a series of similarly themed Numero compilations called Cult Cargo. The bulk of the music on the disc was actually recorded outside of Belize, either by bands formed in the Belizean communities scattered in large American cities, or by Belizean groups touring abroad in Brooklyn and Jamaica. Compton Fairweather's CES label, originally founded as an electronic security system installation company, served as the official curator of the country's music, releasing nearly everything in the United States. Unfortunately, not many people outside of Belize were listening, and the music has languished in obscurity. This set of 16 scraped-together tracks has an aura of the impossible about it. How could this music possibly have existed for so long without being heard by anyone other than a handful of absurdly dedicated crate-diggers? Lord Rhaburn's ""Disco Connection"" is outlandishly danceable, a white dwarf of precision instrumental funk with incredibly sophisticated production that hints at dub, as well as some genres not yet invented at the time of its recording, like house. The reverb on the saxes is majestic, and the bassline has an indescribable humidity to it, burning front-and-center in the mix. Rhaburn was a towering figure in Belizean music and one of its most prolific recorders. His other three songs here run the gamut from roots reggae to deep soul and strutting surf rock with a funky Muscle Shoals undercarriage. Also clocking in with four tracks are the Professionals, led by Jesus Acosta, who first appear as a hardcore calypso band with a wonderful take on the traditional ""Guajida"" (also known as ""Guarija""), opening it with a bright, rugged sax melody that oozes sexuality. They flirt with psychedelia on ""A Part of Being With You"", morph the O'Jays' ""Backstabbers"" into horn-drenched reggae, and reinvent the theme from The Godfather as a spooky breakbeat masterpiece. The Web were actually based in Brooklyn, and their ""Things Are Going to Work Out Right"" is one of the most impressive songs in this boil up, beginning as a bluesy soul ballad slathered in Philly-smooth horns, only to explode midway through into a raucous funk workout stuffed with staccato horns, chicken-scratch guitar, and wailing Hammond organ. The other three artists whose songs have been resurrected by this comp were sadly less prolific but no less remarkable in their skill. Most of these bands played thousands of shows and recorded only when they had the rare opportunity, and their discipline is readily apparently on the precious vinyl they did manage to produce. The Soul Creations offer a two-part funk instrumental called ""Funky Jive"", which is easily on par with anything the Propositions and other similar America funk acts of the era were turning out. The Harmonettes give up a smoking rocksteady take on Johnny Nash's ""Can't Go Halfway"", then outdo themselves by transforming Shirley & Co.'s slick disco smash ""Shame, Shame, Shame"" into a nasty, ragged funk song. The set is rounded out by an oddball song from Nadia Cattouse, a Belizean living in London: ""Long Time Boy"" is exotica pop full of whistling flute and wandering guitar that feels totally out of time and place. It could have come from anywhere, any time, perhaps even outer space. Boil Up is possibly the most solid release to date from Numero Group, which is by this point one of the best and most thoughtful reissue labels in the country. If you like funk-- and especially if you feel you've already largely mined American r&b--; there's plenty to dig into here, and hopefully more where that came from.","First Club Cargo release from the consistently wonderful Numero Group label focuses on the results of Belize's exuberant embrace of 1960s and 70s U.S. funk and soul.

Kreucht & Fleucht,Dominik Eulberg,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd13c0084474cd0c2c0e/1:1/w_160/94fe44cf.jpg,2005-10-26 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2937-kreucht-fleucht/,Mischwald,"Once upon a time, or so the legend goes, house and techno mix CDs were a chance to show off your skills as a DJ-- your technique on the ones and twos, but also the depth of your crate. Then came ProTools and Ableton-enabled mixes, in which segues aren't done with vinyl in real-time, but rather Tetrised into shape in the studio. You'd think that development-- which I'm not about to denigrate, even if software mixes lose the on-the-fly urgency of a real-time session-- meant that more effort would be devoted to track selection, but oddly, exactly the opposite seems to have happened. The vast majority of house and techno mix CDs these days are club-friendly equivalents of Now That's What I Call Music!, gathering the big hits of the prior 18 months. You could probably create a techno parlor game called Six Degrees of Superpitcher, judging by the number of recent mixes that prominently feature the Kompakt wunderkind's tracks. In other words, judging a mix CD is harder than it seems, especially in a day when skillz are optional. Not to be too meta, but the mix CD is essentially a meta affair, a compilation that transcends the sum of its parts through some nameless other that hovers over the proceedings, call it what you like: coherence, flow, artistry. Going by these criteria, Dominik Eulberg sets himself a few critical hurdles with his first official mix CD-- a doublepack released on his own Mischwald label. I'm guessing that Kreucht & Fleucht was mixed digitally, based on the precision of each seamless transition. (If it wasn't, this guy is a freaking mixing machine). It also leans heavily on 2005's underground-to-middleground techno hits, caned-to-death (and occasionally comped-to-death) cuts like John Tejada's ""Paranoia"", Andre Kraml's ""Safari"", and Nathan Fake's ""Dinamo"". Suffice to say that eclecticism isn't Eulberg's priority; Kreucht & Fleucht is a decidedly internal affair, a guide to the Now Sound of clattery, post-minimalist German techno. Well, so be it, because the selection is impeccable. Tunes like ""Dinamo"" are ubiquitous for a reason: They fucking work on the dance floor. And Eulberg's ear-- he's also one of this scene's most in-demand remixers-- finds hidden themes that run through both discs like underground streams, weaving together atonal clanks, sawtooth leads, 8-bit stutter, and grand, epic melodies until you have no idea where one track ends and the other begins. Kreucht, which means something like ""Creeping,"" is the darker of the two discs, given over to the psychedelic end of minimal techno. Tracks from Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos (in a 2002 appearance as Termiten, one of the album's true surprises), A. Vivanico, and Guido Schneider (remixing Dub Kult) are peppered with chirps and twitters and all kinds of bug funk. Gothic-leaning anthems-- Triola's ""Leuchtturm (Wighnomy's Polarzipper Rexmi)"", Michael Mayer's ""Lovefood (Matias Aguayo Mix)""-- crest like bobbing forest canopy above the pitter-patter below. Voices are carried aloft on winds of reverb. When not hunched over his computer, Eulberg is a naturalist, and judging by Kreucht, his woods aren't just wild, they're haunted. If you know that Fleucht means ""Flying,"" you'll see where we're going on disc two. Starting with Eulberg's out-of-orbit remix of Steve Barnes' hypno-house instant classic ""Cosmic Sandwich"", and cruising through tracks like Metope's grinding, weightless ""Libertango"", James Holden's remix of ""Safari"", and Eulberg's mix of ""Dinamo"", Fleucht is all nougat, whipped up and up. (You almost have to hand it to Eulberg for not including Closer Musik's ""1, 2, 3 No Gravity"", if only because it would have been too perfect a fit.) With Tonetraeger's ""Welcome Back, Kotter (Mayer-Thomas Remix)""-- another of the mix's great rediscoveries-- we come dangerously close to burning up on re-entry; those buzzing, frictive chords could strip the insulation off the sturdiest spaceship. But Fleucht's last four tracks are pure, tranced-out bliss for people who think they hate trance, all chiming arpeggio, insistent ostinato, and hearts-beating-as-one kicks. By the end, not even the most jaded listeners will care that the majority of these cuts are from 2005-- unless you're Ricardo Villalobos or Michael Mayer, you probably haven't heard them all anyway. And the how of the mix is a red herring, because the why leaps out at every pulse and stutter. An American-based friend praises it as a home-listening album, but expresses doubt as to how such a set would go over on a dance floor outside Germany. Does it even matter? Consider it a biodome, an ant farm, or a black forest of the mind; Kreucht & Fleucht is its own microsystem, a lab slide that magnifies to lay bare the workings of the whole ecology of house and techno, if you listen right. Now that's what I call music indeed.","This 2xCD mix-- one half more psychedelic, one more blissful-- functions as a guide to the Now Sound of clattery, post-minimalist German techno.

Living in the Gleam of an Unsheathed Sword / Hex: Or Printing in the Infernal Method,Earth,by: Austin Gaines,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd07abf31b7dc7155e5a/1:1/w_160/262ee97e.jpg,2005-10-26 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11737-living-in-the-gleam-of-an-unsheathed-sword-hex-or-printing-in-the-infernal-method/,Troubleman Unlimited,"When one reads about Dylan Carlson and his Earth project, the signs point to him being an over-hyped amateur. Releasing albums consisting of repetitive riffs or tones with little or no drumming and being the former drug buddy of Kurt Cobain each register on my hack radar. Yet, over the years I've been pleasantly impressed with his minimalist sound sculptures-- none more so than on Hex, one of a pair of Earth releases this year. Unfortuantely, the drone guitar star fails to impress on the 60-minute live track which basically constitutes Living in the Gleam. Recorded a few years ago, with a drummer at his side, it finds Carlson still tackling riffs rather than reverting to the suffocating drone of his early albums. It's nothing special, just a handful of riffs repeated in variation and some guesstimating drums to keep the jamming pace. The track doesn't crawl too much but it also fails to go anywhere exciting. Earth tack on a solo guitar piece (""Dissolution III"") that was already hanging around on another release, but Living In the Gleam can't compete with the band's studio output. But when Carlson has enough time to compose his riffs he's pretty damn good. The first studio Earth album in nearly a decade, and a departure from the previous four, Hex is a surprisingly beautiful instrumental album. Instead of distorted riffing, we get the austere beauty of a telecaster roaming the Western U.S. It's a genuine representation of our affliction of romance with the despairing beauty of loneliness, the sound of being in solitary confinement in an expansive, wide-open land. Try good ol' post rock like Mogwai or Low, on a collision course with some of Calexico's more spacious moments and you've got the sound of Hex. The LP's tracks have Americana-like names such as ""The Dire and Ever Circling Wolves"" and ""Land of Some Other Order"", and the overtly western ""An Inquest Concerning Teeth""-- with its simply stunning note progression-- is the standout. While some of Carlson's previous albums were fractured from track to track, Hex is a cohesive vision of the heavy drone/stoner/doom that Earth pioneered. Carlson is a great illustrator and can distill a sensation with just a few notes unlike many other musicians. With Hex, I can feel the wind, see the horizon, and touch the grass-filled plains. I don't think about a guitarist and a drummer plodding along and working out songs, as I do with so much other experimental music. Perhaps the live jamming on Living in the Gleam has the same transformative powers to someone else. Maybe, but I doubt it.","A pair of releases-- one live, one recorded in the studio-- from Dylan Carlson's venerable drone-heavy project.

#1's,Destiny’s Child,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96fc0084474cd0c25ec/1:1/w_160/09b6efda.jpg,2005-10-26 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2290-1s/,ColumbiaSonyColumbiaSony,"Straddling the millennial line, Destiny's Child were either the last great pop group of the 90s or the first great one of the 21st century. And, since hits records are, after the single, the ultimate pop form, #1's should have no difficultly proving that status. Instead, it has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined. They were smart enough not to arrange this compilation chronologically, but since that's still the best way to tell most bands' stories, we'll start this review at the beginning. Destiny's Child
#1's contains only one track from Destiny's Child's little-heard debut. Little heard because it could be the work of any freshly scrubbed African-American teenagers from the mid-90s. Except this was the late-90s and, you know, Timbaland and all that. Weirdly, it was Wyclef Jean who unleashed the beast, adding punchy drums straight off Boogie Down Productions' Criminal Minded on his remix of ""No, No, No (Part 2)"". The group finally had a beat that properly funneled their bottomless well of scalding sass. The Writing's on the Wall
Radio r&b; had already been popping for a good three years before DC took out a mortgage on the Billboard Top 40 in 1999, but they quickly became the platonic ideal, the space-age girl group of our national longings. Men are scrubs, cheaters, and liars, and Beyoncé, Kelly, Michelle, and the other one were avenging angels in pastel rooms with awesome furniture and better hair. Sure, it's a little redolent of that endless summer of the internet bubble economy at this point, but these days a little late-Clinton-era nostalgia hurts no one. The beats, produced largely by Rodney Jerkins and Kevin ""She'kspere"" Briggs, are tsunamis of sparkling harpsichords, trilling xylophones, 8-bit rave riffs, lite-brite guitars, diamondique synth spritz, and sashaying hi-hats. When people whine about how those similar horn o' plenty alchemists in Basement Jaxx stiffed in America, well, we already had Destiny's Child-- with all the jam-packed funny noises, an undeniable song on top, and gorgeous girls in astronaut fabrics in the videos. Destiny's Child made the best pop-R&B; of the modern era. Period. But of course, that's no secret: These were, after all, world-conquering hits. Survivor
So like any teen Glamazon who just shifted five million records, Beyoncé Knowles wanted to assert that she wasn't just two Christmas hams stuffed into a pair of jeans. Which isn't something to hate on, except that she generally made better music as a producer's puppet. Suddenly, the whole world was full of scrubs she must excoriate in song while taking care not to diss them on the internet, proceeding to sell a billion more records. Which proves that though she's got an ego the size of the Astrodome, she's no fool. You would think that some bright spark in the studio could have wiped ""Independent Women Part 1"" clean of the ""Charlie's Angels"" quotes. Prince's ""Batdance"" was a hit but it's not on The Hits, if you get me. I guess that wouldn't do anything to make the beat less functional and more exciting. ""Bootylicious"" and its disco throb are better than I remembered by half, and their cover of ""Emotion"" proves B's got genuine talent for vocal arrangements. If that sounds like damning with faint praise, it is. Destiny's Fufilled
So they broke up. Or ""went on hiatus."" Beyoncé went on to release a solo album with three major hits that everyone knows. Kelly went on to release a solo album with a few singles that no one knows. Michelle went back into cryogenic storage. When Destiny's Fulfilled suddenly burst onto the charts in the fourth quarter of last year-- front-loaded with the two most exciting tracks, not coincidentally the first two singles-- it should have been a sign. ""Lose My Breath"" was a Rodney Jerkins drumline symphony of stabs, stilettos, and that weird mink stole B sported in the video. ""Soldier"" featured Rich ""1 Thing"" Harrison doing his best recession-era southern rap impression, with former Xtian good girls making double-barreled cock/firearm puns. The rest of the album oozed essential oils and upscale r&b; respectability. ""Girl"" was a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its ""Sex & the City"" video. And then there was ""Cater 2 U"", which reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade of kept-wifey pleas, lemme wipe your ass for you, cough, hack, splutter, barf. New/Bonus Tracks Opener ""Stand Up for Love"" is subtitled the ""2005 World Children's Day Anthem"", which should tell you all you really need to know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions. ""Check on It"" features Slim Thug and a sing-songy Swiz beat and should become a minor hit when cross-marketing with the new ""Pink Panther"" movie begins in earnest. Closer ""Feel the Same Way I Do"" sounds like an outtake from Mariah Carey's Emancipation, and ends with Beyoncé dumping her man-- kind of a bummer note to go out on. Plus, Michelle now sounds like Eartha Kitt after a few whippets and it's really annoying. Final Verdict
In the MP3 age, you can take #1's as pure product and not feel wrong for doing so. (They're not thanking McDonald's and Pepsi in the liner notes out of the goodness of their hearts.) At eight awesome, three godawful, and five middling songs, it's clearly not worth 20 clams. So compile your own DC best-of online. Or just go buy The Writing's on the Wall, available for less than 12 bucks at any of our nation's finer discount department stores. You should still have enough left over for your automobills.","Multi-platinum and frequently wonderful r&b; group caps its career with a hit-and-miss singles retrospective.

Wohaw,The USA Is a Monster,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8fdb1335d7bf16993f6/1:1/w_160/a376eedf.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:06,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8379-wohaw/,Load,"Named after the 19th century Kiowa warrior whose artwork graces its cover, Wohaw is USAISAMONSTER's second album for Load Records, and on it the Brooklyn-based duo continue the righteous rampage of 2003's Tasheyana Compost. Over the course of 14 tracks, Wohaw finds group members Tom Hohmann and Colin Langevin using their combustible noise-rock to address the plight and lost histories of various oppressed peoples, particularly Native Americans. Needless to say, this is an ambitious undertaking, one made more so by the inherent rigors of the duo's music. Combining the hyperspeed prog-metal riffing of compatriots Lightning Bolt, the ethno-pummel of Sun City Girls' Torch of the Mystics, and a surprising abundance of campfire-baked folk, the album gallops recklessly from one destination to the next as though determined to throw even the hardiest cavalry off their trail. As you might suspect from their cumbersome band name or song titles like ""All the Worlds Leaders Must Die"", USAISAMONSTER don't necessarily put much stock in subtlety. Granted, this does little to hinder tracks like opener ""Clay People"", which boasts the thunder of a stampeding herd of bison, or the self-explanatory ""Riff Scientist"" which matches high-pitched squalls with hairpin chords and vocals that recall the stoner karaoke stylings of early Meat Puppets. Throughout these heavier tracks, Hohmann and Langevin display an almost preternatural degree of cohesion, as they corner every spastic, complex rhythm as though they're on rails. Midway through the album, the twosome make their most unlikely U-turn yet, as the tranquil ""Waterfall"" initiates a five-track sequence of unadulterated acoustic folk. Accompanied only by acoustic guitars, on ""George Catlin and the Mandan Chief"" Langevin negotiates some extremely unwieldy lyrics (""A likeness of the Mandan's Chief/ Was recognized with disbelief/ Excited curiosity of the entire village at once"") to create a bittersweet vision of the American artist Catlin as he captures portraits of cultures bound for extinction. Stranger still is ""Alligator Allegory"", a wandering narrative sung with an otherworldly, almost Skip Spence-like eccentric flourish. As engaging as this brief acoustic interlude is, the twosome do little in attempt to unite the album's distinct sonic poles. Following Wohaw's acoustic lull, the passionate Leonard Peltier saga ""God Is Red"" opens with an intro of exotic reeds and tribal drumming, but soon lumbers back into the band's familiar mathematical pounding, all traces of folk dissipated into thin air. And though this abrupt about-face might earn USAISAMONSTER some bones for versatility, it also makes an already thorny album sound that much more disjointed, causing some listeners to long for the day when the duo can figure out a way to bring their various surging streams into better confluence.","Brooklyn-based duo's second album for Load continues the righteous rampage of 2003's Tasheyana Compost.

Rip Through the Hawk Black Night,Make a Rising,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36b5e6ef95969323822/1:1/w_160/702ad375.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5666-rip-through-the-hawk-black-night/,High Two,"As you stumble through repeated listens to this disc and your brain makes sense of the chaotic song fragments, you might find a thread in the album by hearing it as a story-- a children's adventure, say, the kind that has maximum momentum with minimum exposition. The guitar and violin that echo Robert Fripp and David Cross sparring in mid-'70s King Crimson also sounds like you're fending off 10 pirates at a crowded bar and slicing out their tongues without knocking over a single beer. The hollow rattle of percussion stands for chains rattling hopelessly at the bottom of a prison-- and the arbitrarily long drones sound like making an escape out a 10th-story window and praying for an awning below. Or maybe that's all wrong. For their debut LP, Make a Rising, a cult fave around Philadelphia that deserve wider attention, may not have planned out a narrative so much as a series of incidents and accidents. The arrangements and production hew close to '70s art rock and Henry Cow, but the transitions are all post-Zorn-- and the listeners who are used to translating musical cues and moods into a cogent whole will find themselves ready to deal with this kind of music after, say, Cerberus Shoal's last few records, or even Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat. We're trained to go with the flow-- wherever it leads. Make a Rising recorded it at their work space, giving it a strange but old atmosphere like a decommissioned black box theater: The upright piano sounds dusty, and the musicians rattle around in the wings and jump in whenever it's their turn. The first eight cuts run together in what may or may not be a suite, which is largely instrumental, outside of the male and female vocals that whiz in and out like tissue-paper ghosts on a string. Those songs are followed by the ""Expired Planet"", a far more conventional and summery pop song (aside from the male singer, who sounds like he's trying to stand up in a canoe), and the album wraps up with the surprisingly sweet ukulele and accordion of ""Partial Thoughts"". Without sounding sloppy, the performance is ramshackle, with plenty of room sound to fade into and acoustic blind spots to jump out of, making your first listen unpredictable: breaks and free passages run longer than you expect, and the melodic, driving sections that follow leave you wary of what's coming next. Needless to say, that's what makes it so engaging. Some modern ears may be spoiled by bands like-- to take yet another not-really-similar example-- Animal Collective, who always wind up safely back at the campfire: Rip Through the Hawk Black Night ends sweetly but it doesn't clear things up. But that has its own rewards.","On the Philly band's debut LP, the production hews closely to '70s art rock and Henry Cow, but the transitions are all post-Zorn.

Station 55,Cristian Vogel,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9689d034d5c69bf3c45/1:1/w_160/4e17b8af.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8483-station-55/,Mute,"South American by birth, international in practice, Cristian Vogel makes techno and electronic pop with an experimental bent but with no obvious ties to any genre in particular. Like his sometime collaborator Jamie Lidell (with whom he performs as Super_Collider), Vogel occupies a thoroughly modern field of expression, one that I'd have a hard time denying on artistic grounds even as it seems a world away from what usually passes for ""hip"". Even worse, unlike Lidell, he doesn't trespass into hip-hop or blue-eyed soul, so there's little chance you're going to hear him without seeking out his recordings. He can usually be found near the epicenter of wherever the most forward-looking techno is happening (Spain, at the moment), though that doesn't necessarily mean you'll hear his stuff in a lot of clubs. The guy taught modern classical music at the university level for crying out loud. Fittingly, Vogel's music is individualist to a fault. Like spiritual kin Cluster, Mouse on Mars, Asmus Tietchens, or even fellow electro-provocateur Fennesz, he revels in moods that disturb, illuminating his ideas with the darkest shades possible, and yet is ultimately inclusive and alluring. His latest record, Station 55, features collaborations with several vocalists (including an ultra-cool Kevin Blechdom harmony arrangement on the album's single ""1968, Holes""), but sounds to me like a single-minded soundtrack of near-future Europe. Where previous albums like 1996's Specific Momentific or 1999's Busca Invisibles were bizarre, techno-centric takes on experimental music, Station 55 is less bump, more eerie propulsion. Much of the fat has been trimmed, in line with the same wave of minimalism that's fueled techno since its Detroit inception-- but especially recently via labels like Kompakt, Poker Flat, and Bpitch Control-- so rather than fill floors, I'd expect this stuff to spark conversation, introspection. The lead track, ""Typewriter of the Dead"", makes no bones about its own lethargy, lurching out of the gate with murky organ and a slow, digital blues shuffle (in fact, when Jim Jarmusch does his sci-fi flick, he should run this over the opening credits). And then the fun starts: ""The Time Lock"", ""1968, Holes"", and ""On the Line"" comprise a no-frills suite of goth-cool good enough for the downest hipsters and smartest DJs alike. And of course, the funky digi-bass of ""The Time Lock"" or military precision rhythm track on ""1968, Holes"" do wonders for me when I'm driving or reading or thinking about how much I'd like to jet off to Barcelona tonight. All three tunes brim with forward momentum, so it's not like you couldn't dance to them, and in fact they'd thrill the sweaty, dancing masses plopped in the middle of a set of minimal house where anything on either side of them would seem like either a warm-up or a comedown. Blechdom's vocals are like daggers though, so use them carefully. ""Neon Underground"" samples a jazz trap-set playing contorted samba, and Vogel uses a synth chord progression reminiscent of Boards of Canada or Aphex Twin in ambient mode. Unlike BoC's latest stuff, he forgoes easy-on-the-ears resolution in favor of the kind of terminally unraveling, vague tension that got a lot of people interested in IDM in the first place. Likewise, ""Arctic Wolfman"" and ""Turn On, Tune In, Drown Out"" seem calm on the surface, but threaten to implode due to the weight of their own dissonances. It's not that they're ""difficult"" listening per se, rather, their bleak textures juxtaposed with airtight beats (half-time micro-hip-hop and robot house bump, respectively) turn restraint and understatement against themselves. Vogel may hide his musical payoffs beneath a mask of steely experimentation, but rest assured, the emotional tension below the surface is a constant, explosive threat.","The other half of Super_Collider matches partner Jamie Lidell's 2005 accomplishment with a trim, propulsive techno record.

A Musical History,The Band,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49a5e6ef959693208ee/1:1/w_160/ed4e5a0b.gif,2005-10-25 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1178-a-musical-history/,Capitol,"Under their singularly anonymous moniker, the Band consisted of four Canadians and one Arkansawyer, five accomplished musicians who could switch instruments as effortlessly as they changed musical styles: Richard Manuel (soulful vocals, piano, drums), Rick Danko (vocals, bass, guitar), Robbie Robertson (guitar, lyrics), Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, vocals), and Garth Hudson (organ, accordion, reed instruments, and everything else). A Musical History, the five-disc/one-DVD set executive produced by Robertson, follows the quintet from their roots in the Canadian rockabilly scene to Woodstock to The Last Waltz, distilling more than 15 years down to five discs and 102 tracks, of which nearly 40 are either previously unreleased or unavailable on CD. Pop artist Ed Ruscha painted the monochromatic portrait on the cover, and Rob Bowman contributes monographic liner notes, heavily excerpting his contributions from the 2000 reissues. As for the title, what other kind of history could there be? A Musical History proves much more definitive than any previous compilations, which typically start with the Band's first album; however, it's not the length of its tracklist, but the range, that counts. A Musical History begins with a one-disc prologue with tracks from The Band's previous incarnations-- Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, Levon and the Hawks, Bob Dylan's backing band, and Crackers. The band that eventually became the Band paid their dues the old-fashioned way: they apprenticed themselves. It was Ronnie Hawkins who really taught them to ""play fuckin' loud,"" a tactic that honed their killer chops and barnstorming showmanship. Under Dylan's tutelage during his first electric tour they learned that their songs were not restricted by any particular structure, running time, or tradition and so could be whatever The Band wanted them to be. So listening to this first disc is like reading an accomplished writer's very first short stories: These songs reveal a hesitant, undeveloped voice that's not quite certain yet what's possible or permissible, but the music is cast in sharp relief by our knowledge of future accomplishments. Despite the inclusion of unreleased tracks uncovered in DJ/producer Duff Roman's basement (like the instrumental ""Bacon Fat"" and the caustic ""Leave Me Alone""), this is a slow, albeit valuable, chapter in the Band's history, peppered with some admittedly fiery numbers. ""Who Do You Love"" sounds like Hawkins is stirring up a riot and his band is trying to muffle it. And the live cuts of Dylan's ""Tell Me, Momma"" and ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" have a rough, obstinate grandeur that deflected all the boos the folk-purist audiences hurled at them. Both Hawkins and Dylan were outsized personas who dominated the stage and often obscured the five musicians behind them. When they finally formed the Band, Danko, Helm, Hudson, Manuel, and Robertson opted for something a little more democratic (or like communism, as Helm remarks in his autobiography). The key to the Band was that no voice or instrument dominated, but still, everyone was doing something very interesting all the time. There are three distinct vocalists on Music From Big Pink and The Band, and everyone except Robertson trades out instruments. The result is a pair of albums that still sound simultaneously experimental and traditional, irreverent and respectful. Music From Big Pink is included on A Musical History in its entirety-- anything less would be a travesty-- but with the previously unavailable full-length version of ""To Kingdom Come"" (which leaves Hudson's organ solo intact) and an alternate take of ""Lonesome Suzie"". The Band is represented by about two-thirds of its tracks, with live or alternate versions of the remaining third. It's no stretch to say this pair of albums marks the Band's peak-- blues, folk, jazz, rock, funk, soul, r&b;, and country and western all synthesized into twin monuments to the American music they'd been playing for nearly a decade in clubs, roadhouses, and honkytonks with Hawkins and in stadiums and basements with Dylan. Their early apprenticeships had given them everything they needed to make these albums, but failed to teach them how to deal with the ensuing money and success. It's all pretty much downhill from the final chords of ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)"": The Band suffered in the limelight, which shifted their communal work ethic from collaboration to isolation. Drugs, poor reviews, and intra-Band ego clashes ravaged the group, making The Last Waltz seem like a logical, if somewhat preemptive conclusion. Still, despite some dips here and there (especially Robertson's awkward storytelling on ""The Moon Struck One""), the final two disks prove the quintet remained a powerful unit, able to sculpt intricate songs that rambled and grooved. Allen Toussaint's mind-boggling horn arrangements on Cahoots and Rock of Ages-- the bulk of the fourth disc-- give songs like ""Life Is a Carnival"" and ""Don't Do It"" a hit of energy that enlivens the arrangements considerably. The Moondog Matinee covers are adventurous and irreverent: it takes temerity to add new verses to Little Junior Parker's Blue Flames' ""Mystery Train"", but the Band makes the new material sound like it actually belongs there. And Helm's enthusiastic vocals on Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry's ""Ain't Got No Home"" reveal a good humor and spiritedness that contrasts nicely with soberer songs like ""It Makes No Difference"". The fifth disc includes ""Forever Young"", the only excerptable song from Planet Waves, along with two tracks from the Band's 1974 tour with Dylan: ""Rainy Day Women #12 & 35"" is noteworthy for its goofy ad libs, while ""Highway 61 Revisited"" barrels along with righteous hot-rod abandon. After tracks from the underrated Northern Lights--Southern Cross and the odds-and-ends Islands, as well as a few outtakes and rarities (like Rick Danko's exquisitely homesick ""Home Cookin'""), the set closes with three tracks from The Last Waltz: ""Evangeline"" with Emmylou Harris, a majestic version of ""The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down"", and ""The Weight"" performed with the Staple Singers. And that's where A Musical History concludes, venturing no further than 1978, despite the fact that four of the five members continued touring as the Band during the 1980s. There are no tracks from those lonely tours nor from any of the members' various solo projects. Furthermore, Bowman's notes end well before they can consider the three decades between The Last Waltz and A Musical History-- the deaths of Manuel and Danko, the Band's diminishing legacy, or even the long-awaited official release of Dylan's show at the Royal Albert Hall. So this set doesn't provide a complete history, but its abrupt cut-off point seems unavoidable, perhaps even natural: The Band was no more or less than those five men, who were united in their mission to make music not as pop culture, but as American culture.","Expansive five-disc, 102-track box set sensibly features all of Music From Big Pink, plus nearly 40 songs either previously unreleased or previously unavailable on CD.

With a Cape and a Cane,The Joggers,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab64c0084474cd0c1380/1:1/w_160/70c92c71.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8979-with-a-cape-and-a-cane/,StarTime,"With a Cape and a Cane sounds merely like a solid indie rock record on a passing listen; give it a few more spins and you will be rewarded. Absent here are the sophisticated vocal harmonies of the Joggers debut, Solid Guild, replaced with even more copious amounts of guitar. I know-- guitars in indie rock, not really a revelation. But it's where the guitars go that matters: abrasive, thin-toned strings crawl into unexpected places, doubling and echoing each other, racing up and down unusual scales and squealing like spoiled babies. They ape Eastern tones on opener ""Ziggurat Traffic"" and fake the funk on ""Wicked Light Sleeper""; an extraneous screech becomes the foundation to the chorus of ""Since You're Already Up"", and a nervous atonal shuffle turns majestic on ""White Madam"". If there's an open chord anywhere on the album, I can't find it. To that end, the album is similar to this year's Broken Social Scene record-- both are the works of guitar-driven pop bands that still seem embarrassed of the limelight, with BSS hiding their hooks behind inscrutable production and Joggers weaving through convoluted compositions. But where Broken Social Scene was messy and potentially self-sabotaging, Joggers have the instinct to know when to let go. Just behind these jittery hi-hats and spidery riffs are dizzy sing-along hooks that burst through almost too quickly, as if the band couldn't stand to hold them back any longer. ""Ziggurat Traffic"" sounds like field-recorded Eastern strings over a heartbeat rhythm before erupting into sloppy, ambitious guitar-rock-- all unexpected rhythm breaks, frenetic drum fills, and layered counter-melodies. The band routinely moves through unwieldy compositions, but there's always a payoff for the listener. Ben Whitesides' slurred, nonchalant vocals are part of what makes Cape and a Cane sound so self-conscious and occasionally generic, but the big choruses beg for drunken sing-alongs, and his delivery is perfect for the slow-tempo ""Night of the Horsepills"". ""Wicked Light Sleeper"" gives the first inclination the band can write songs and not just jams, and-- while Cape and a Cane is consistent from top to bottom-- it opens the record's best moments: ""Era Prison"", with tension-building sing-spoken verses and an endearingly sloppy chorus, and the frantic rhythms and breathless chorus of ""Since You're Already Up"". Consistency is one of the band's biggest virtues here, but it's their grip on resistance and release that anchors the album, with hints of ambition poking out from beneath its slacker skin. From the Eastern tones on the opening and closing tracks to the dance influences on ""Era Prison"" and ""White Madam"", the Joggers fix their eyes on somewhere farther than your local dive venue without sacrificing their own unkempt charm. If there's a complaint, it's that they ditched one unique sound (the group harmonies of Solid Guild) and only met new ones halfway. But give the Joggers time to hone things further-- With a Cape and a Cane will still be a dense, satisfying listen after they take their next big step.","Indie rock band weaves through delightfully convoluted compositions built on jittery hi-hats, spidery riffs, and dizzy sing-along hooks.

Descended Like Vultures,Rogue Wave,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a302c0084474cd0c019e/1:1/w_160/6c532c3e.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6920-descended-like-vultures/,Sub Pop,"As a member of the Desoto Reds, Zach Rogue was working a crushing 70 hours/week at a web development company, frustrated, and desperate for change. Then a round of layoffs saved Rogue like a last-minute call from the governor and he beat a retreat to New York to see what he could accomplish on his own. Clutching a sheaf of the delicately odd pop songs he'd written but had no outlet for in Desoto Reds, he holed up in the studio with his friend Bill Racine and together the two began spontaneously cranking out the tracks that would become Out of the Shadow, an album that would earn Rogue Wave a Sub Pop deal-- and an endless parade of Shins comparisons. The spirit of adventure and freedom that accompanied Rogue's life-change was apparent in the record, which featured wispy, spectral tunes, somewhere between Simon & Garfunkel and Yo La Tengo, embroidered with intricate details. Rogue assembled a band to take the songs on the road, and this quartet-- which includes Gram LeBron, Pat Spurgeon, and Evan Farrell-- is collectively responsible for Rogue Wave's sophomore outing, Descended Like Vultures. As such, it's reasonable to expect a record very different from the debut, which was penned entirely by Rogue. The first single from the new album, ""10:1"", confirms a sea change: Where the atmospheric debut laced cloudy melodies with quiet traces of heat lightning, ""10:1"" is a crashing thunderbolt. The thin, melodic contour lines that primarily structured Out of the Shadow become barely discernible underpinnings on this track, subsumed in raucously cartwheeling synths and returning producer Bill Racine's bracing guitar manipulation. The only vestige of the old Rogue Wave is Rogue's voice. Has the band that relied on off-kilter charm forsaken their chilly moderation for heat-seeking rock? You know, sort-of-ish: ""10:1"" is a bit of a red herring. The main difference between the two albums has more to do with volume than style. The production now has more depth, and you're more likely to hear subtle (or not-so-subtle, in the case of ""10:1"") filters on the vocals. Out of the Shadow seemed to emanate from very far away, but Descended Like Vultures is more visceral and immediate, although the loud tracks are largely tempered and controlled. Once the disappointment that it's not a Leonard Cohen cover fades, the album's opening track, ""Bird on a Wire"", is a charming introduction to the louder side of Rogue Wave: Crisp drum rolls and strident bleats buffet the melody toward an outsized, lighter-waving chorus. The driving mid-tempo guitars that open ""Publish My Love"" are contrasted with an acoustic arpeggio that would've been the song's stopping point on the first album. The excellent ""Love's Lost Guarantee"" profits from the same contrast, revealing a surprising but totally sensible Death Cab for Cutie affinity as it alternates darkly twinkling passages with romantically crashing choruses. Other tracks expand upon the gauzy, pensive aura of Out of the Shadow instead of revising it. A lively yet gentle strum and Rogue's weightless vocal melody comprise ""California""; a low wash of strings colors the back end, and in its simple transparency it's one of the album's most memorable songs. ""Temporary"" should come included with stool and capo, with its murky chord progression and mumbled, depressive vocals. In the end, it's hard to decide if Descended Like Vultures is better or worse than Rogue Wave's debut. Differences that seem major turn out, upon close inspection, to be cosmetic, and if the extra padding relieves the songs of some of their signature inertia, the parts that stick in your head-- Rogue's lilting, saccharine melodies-- remain unchanged. Rather than evolving linearly, Rogue Wave are building upwards, piling masonry onto a foundation of solid songwriting that, with any luck, will remain as perceptible and essential on Rogue Wave's 10th album as it is on their second.","Sub Pop signings expand to a quartet and follow their debut LP, Out of the Shadow, with a more visceral, immediate effort.

DJ-Kicks,Annie,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ae9d034d5c69bf27a1/1:1/w_160/8fdc556f.jpg,2005-10-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/457-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Draw the lines, she says, don't sweat it either. What Annie's made clear with her entry into the DJ-Kicks series is it ain't difficult to see where Anniemal came from or what she's all about. The punk-funk savants ESG (""My Love For You"") anticipate the story behind ""The Greatest Hit"", Annie singing over her producer boyfriend's Madonna loop for kicks and ending up with a career in in(die)ternational pop. Adams/Carmichael disco (Bumble Bee Unlimited's ""Lady Bug"") nails her high camp chic, while the Mu inclusion (""Paris Hilton"") hints she feels more akin to mutant pop than her vocal similarities to Kylie or Rachel might suggest. And despite her barefaced pop-for-rockers plan for world domination (cf. Braxe and Falke's filter remix of the mini-metal outfit Death From Above 1979's ""Black History Month""), Annie doesn't forget she's from the small town of Bergen, Norway, and she generously reps her home on this mix too (electro-pop Toy and fey disco-pop Datarock begin and end the mix respectively). One disc, the influence game is out, so too any doubts re: Annie's big-eared, wide-eyed listening habits. Now granted, over the years the mirror has ruined a few. So Annie's own contributions take on increased significance, existing partly just because, partly for the posture of non-posturing, but entirely as proof that her conscious penchant for the off-kilter hasn't strangled her sound. ""Wedding"" may come off a bit high-low: Röyksopp's uncharacteristically sinister bubble plop electric production grinds harsh against a song whose chorus is ""Will you marry me?"" followed by ""I do, I do, I do."" But Annie's better than that. Her verb tense fuck-up (should be ""I will"") effectively timewarps past fiancehood and flower arrangements and all those stupid fucking pre-Cana meetings, straight to the vow-- funny, if you play along. Same thing with the Timo Kaukolampi-produced ""Gimme Your Money"", a Cristina-meets-Madonna needy-girl song that tellingly comes between ""Lady Bug"" (""Just let me be your lady bug"") and Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" (""I want candy""). Annie knows where she fits into these traditions, but even more, she still finds room to install local character. Her vocal contribution to Norwegian producer Brundtland and Therson's debut ""Geared Up"" tackles that cold, lonely ""Poor Leno"" pop sound, while Kaukolampi's Motivii Tuntematon's ""1939"" plays like a Vitalic track at half speed-- perhaps the start of this country's own brand of swisha-""house"". Like Kompakt's Michael Mayer said about his Fabric mix, Annie clearly loves her tracks more than the art of loving her tracks. Mixing is merely functional, tracks play long. There is one blatant and unforgivable fuck-up though: Datarock's crosseyed chicken-scratch disco closer ""Fa-Fa-Fa"" is buried three minutes into the last track because of a cueing error with the Mu track before, which will disorient people not familiar with the songs. Regardless, the mistake feeds into the mix's biggest appeal, its amateurism. Annie's has more of a friend-to-friend feel than any other Kicks entry, the kind of mix with messages to be decoded, biography to be considered. Can't say the same for most DJ mixes, really, and definitely not for artist full-lengths. Whether in character or inadvertently, Annie invites weirdly personal reactions, as anyone she's pointed at in concert can tell you. Anniemal was the first date, and now she's making us mixes. Oh, she wants to be my lady bug-- well that's just great. ","Electro-pop star turns selector for the venerable DJ-Kicks series, offering a few of her own tracks plus songs by ESG, Mu, and Death From Above 1979, among others.

Blitzkrieg Pop,T. Raumschmiere,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a218b1335d7bf16983ff/1:1/w_160/efaa6382.jpg,2005-10-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6696-blitzkrieg-pop/,Novamute,"Marco Haas is a man with a problem. On one hand, the guy can make twitchy European electro-tech with the best of them-- whether it's the buzzy malfunctioning-synth tics we usually get from Bpitch Control records, the detailed pulse we usually get from Kompakt records, or just dubbing out into grainy space. On the other hand, his T.Raumschmiere project has a shtick of its own: ultra-heavy monster-truck bangers, cartoon heavy metal, trucker-hatted skull logos, and live sets that make you hope he's not going to try and smash his laptop at the end. And as of his last full-length, these two things co-existed beautifully; as of his last few clenched-teeth tweaker-techno singles, they were positively losing their seams. But Haas has a problem: Let that cartoon tech-metal ramp up (or camp up) just a step too far, and it turns into something kind of, well, uncool-- crossing the line from lovably brutal Germanic electronics into something sub-Rammstein, a kind of mallrat military-industrial metal that doesn't really square with the guy's skill set. And worse: Once you've let that particular monster come rumbling out of the bag, aren't your subtly crafted electro-grinds going to seem a little pale in comparison-- a little, say, not the main event? Blitzkrieg Pop, sadly enough, is all about that problem, and it does you the favor of laying out the stakes from the get-go: ""Sick Like Me"", the first proper song, takes us further than we've previously gone into the world of Raumschmiere-as-rocker. Now there are guitars. Now Haas sounds like he's from Cleveland, and raised on a steady diet of Nine Inch Nails' ""Wish"". Now Haas imagines calling people ""schmucks"" is a real tough-guy put-down (on two different tracks!). There certainly isn't much ""tech"" left in it. And as far as fake-metal goes, it's alright-- dorkily, adorably amped-up, like a wannabe-grim Andrew WK, and certainly better than the title track, which competes with, and mostly loses to, any number of one-hit nu-metal chancers from three-year-old episodes of ""Headbanger's Ball"". Yes, those are the rockers that bookend this album-- leaving the remaining half-hour open for Haas to worry his way around That Problem. In spots, it's the old Raumschmiere-as-usual: Grim schaffel throb on ""All Systems Go"", or Ellen Allien guest-vamping on ""Diving in Whiskey"", which feels like a flatter-- more earthbound take on her own last album. But hard-man habits are hard to break, and Haas can't resist going out on a limb with a little ""now is the time on Sprockets where we RAWK""-- easy-to-resist fake-punk on ""A Mess"" leading straight into some over-the-top hair-metal vocals from Judith Juillerat on ""A Very Loud Lullaby"". Leading straight into some wonderfully creepy insectoid crawl on ""Der Grottenholm"", but let's face it: Once you've tried your shouts on, your nice subtle crawls tend to get overshadowed. Which leaves basically one keeper: ""An Army of Watt"", a track that bothers doing the one thing that makes the Raumschmiere shtick work-- revving functional, fist-in-the-air dance music into a clenched-teeth old-school brutalism. And I guess now we just go on hoping Haas knows the sound of his floor bangers is his bread and butter-- and that fake-metal techno doesn't actually need to push the envelope into just plain fake metal, no matter how fun or logical it seems.","More aggressive, almost cartoonish tech-metal from electro whiz Marco Haas.

Ceasefire,Emmanuel Jal,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb55ea9e61561daa71fb/1:1/w_160/d4a0642e.jpg,2005-10-24 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4364-ceasefire/,World Music Network,"Ceasefire is an album whose backstory threatens to overshadow its music. Emmanuel Jal and Abdel Gadir Salim have spent most of their lives less than a thousand miles from each other, but they may as well have been on different planets, as they fell on different sides of the front line in Sudan's long and brutal north-south civil war (a separate conflict from the current troubles in Darfur). The war pitted the Muslim, Arab, and comparatively wealthy north against the south, where most are adherents of indigenous faiths, along with a sizable Christian minority. Salim is an elder statesman of northern Sudanese music and a master oud player, while Jal was forced into duty with John Garang's rebel SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) group before he turned eight, training in Ethiopian camps and fighting skirmish actions before he learned to read. After years of fighting and a defection to a rival rebel group, Jal was ultimately helped out of the country by Emma McCune, a British aid worker with Street Kids International, but was left as one of thousands of so-called Lost Boys of Sudan after her death. Schooled in Kenya and London with help from McCune's friends and family, Jal turned to music after converting to Christianity. And it seems fitting that his odder-than-fiction path into the world of hip-hop should find him entering the international stage (he's already released an album of gospel hip-hop in Kenya) on an album he shares with a musician from the north of Sudan, in an unprecedented pairing. Jal and Salim do not mix their music thoroughly on most of Ceasefire, instead allowing Salim's elegant desert blues-- played on oud, accordion, saxophone, wooden drums, and bass-- to rub up against the sequenced beats and funky flow of Jal, who raps in Nuer, Arabic, English, Dinka, and Kiswahili-- sometimes bouncing between four different languages in the space of one verse. It works surprisingly well, and not just because the two musicians appear on some of each other's tracks. What really is striking about it is how effortlessly Salim's organic, traditional percussion and Egyptian-influenced singing style fits alongside Jal's more 21st century sound. Unsurprisingly, the lyrics of both men reflect on the hope for lasting peace in their country (a peace already encroached upon by the Darfur violence). Jal opens ""Aiwa"" (Arabic for ""yes"") with a verse in Nuer that translates to ""I would love to sing in all the people's languages/ With this chance that I have I want to express/ The whole of my heart to the whole of the world."" The chorus trades Nuer lines with Arabic affirmations, something that would have been next to impossible only a year ago. The vast majority of the album is not sung or rapped in a language I can speak, but I've always enjoyed listening to lyrics I can't understand. I think it removes an extra layer of baggage (Jal's evangelism can be heavy-handed in translations) and allows me to just concentrate on the pure sound of the voices, which in this case is hugely rewarding. Salim's singing has a clipped dryness to it as he plays his vocals against his wriggling oud lines and accordion merges with sax on pentatonic scales. Salim's contributions are tonally similar to each other, and breaking them up in order to place them throughout the album brings out the details in each of them. It likely also makes for a more interesting listen for Western ears used to modulations and non-diatonic chords. As for Jal's songs, ""Elengwen"", ""Gua"", and ""Baai"" make a monster trio of hip hop tracks. The first begins with a bouncing beat and a guitar/flute duel before Jal offers some of his most interesting verses, from a flow perspective. Large, mostly female backing choruses offer catchy interjections, coming to the fore with a jerky English-language plea for peace on ""Baai"". Live guitar and sax spice up the arrangements, and Salim's oud shows up on ""Baai"", floating through the strutting beat like a linen caught in a sharp wind. The song may be about the end of an appalling war, but it has unbelievable floor potential. Music obviously cannot put a wrecked nation back together, but it can be one of the first steps toward reconciliation, and Ceasefire succeeds beautifully as both that and an interesting album with potential to appeal in just about any corner of the world's geography. Perhaps the most impressive thing about it is that the music isn't overwhelmed by the history of its players and their country. Ceasefire is a celebration of peace that looks forward to better days, and that's something I think we can feel in any language.","Fascinating and frequently captivating collaboration between musicians from opposing sides in Sudan's civil war.

Rehearsing My Choir,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be77abf31b7dc7156157/1:1/w_160/fe7496b5.jpg,2005-10-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3274-rehearsing-my-choir/,Rough Trade,"Just a few years into their career, and the Fiery Furnaces are already one of rock's most restless, unpredictable bands. The sibling duo launched in 2003 with an addictively quirky debut (Gallowsbird's Bark), promptly rolled out an elaborate follow-up (2004's epic Blueberry Boat), released a collection of UK singles and B-sides (the full-length EP), and are now about to dump their grandest opus to date on poised-and-perplexed ears: Rehearsing My Choir is a sprawling piano opera starring Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger's grandmother, Olga Sarantos, and it's every bit as terrible and fantastic as it sounds. If you can swallow Rehearsing My Choir as oral history, in the vein of NPR's National Story Project or Tom Russell's Kerouac-slurping poetry, the album offers an extraordinarily detailed portrait of mid-century Chicago, all rickety old Fords, crinkling photographs of Robert Mitchum, excessive drinking, gabbing about the war, working on the railroad. The sequencing isn't chronological-- if you trace the map Matthew includes in the record's press kit, the album moves from the present to the 40s, 20s, 30s, 50s, back to the 40s, into the 60s, and then the 90s-- though it doesn't much matter, as the narrative instead follows the kind of internal timeline that makes sense only to its tellers. Ultimately, it's the story of Sarantos' love of her late husband, the heft of her grief, and all the stuff that happened between first kiss and funeral march-- from the condolence cards of opener ""The Garfield El"" to the graveyard of closer ""Does It Remind You of When?"", Rehearsing My Choir is a weird testament to the inevitable passage of time, and the casualties of inertia. As a think piece, Rehearsing My Choir is enormously engaging, but as a pop record, it's exhausting and fruitless. Narrative supersedes melody time after time; there are no real songs, just cacophonous noodling and stacks and stacks of polysyllabic words. The majority of the record plays like amateur musical theater, steeped in prog-rock dementia and in love with the sound of its own voice. Unsurprisingly, the chief exception is the predominantly grandma-free (and essentially irrelevant, at least story-wise) ""The Wayward Granddaughter"": The song features drum machine boinks and zip-zapping synths and Matthew's disco whirls bouncing off Eleanor's (comparatively) silky pipes, as she embodies ""Connie,"" a popular, Greek-American teenager who bites it (metaphorically, and possibly literally) at the hands of one of two boyfriends named Kevin. When Sarantos eventually does appear, it's as Connie's grandmother-- and delivers some of the record's most telling couplets, lamenting the capriciousness of age (""Her gorgeous red-brown hair black/ When she turned 15 behind my back"") and, to an extent, explaining the impetus behind the entire enterprise (""Well, we could talk about it, Connie/ But often, memories are better off sung/ Remember when I was young?""). Sarantos' voice is weird and spectacular, dripping with dramatic flair, richer than Eleanor's determinably flat intones, and more obviously enthralled with the material. Deep and vaguely creaky, with just enough quake to emphasize the gravity of her story, Sarantos' pipes are thick and androgynous, heavy with the weight of hindsight-- appropriately, they age as the record plods onward, and by the closing track, Sarantos sounds exhausted and beaten. Eleanor's role, vocally, is less clear: For the most part, she embodies her grandmother's younger self-- the self-ascribed voice-of-the-moment-- but she does so without immediacy or aplomb, leaving the two vocal lines too distinct to convincingly articulate the same story. Meanwhile, the band does its best to incorporate Matthew's instrumental diddles, with varying success. ""We Wrote Letters Everyday"" uses upright piano to recreate long-lost love letters; it's a coy, earnest device, protecting the sanctity of the form. ""Who knows what we wrote/ And what they said/ But this is probably how they read,"" Sarantos muses, followed by alternating bits of dark, longing piano and sprightly keyboards. Later, breaking down the voices of the priests at her wedding (""They all had fine voices/ But, and I mean this respectfully, they didn't match pitch,"" Eleanor clucks), Sarantos commands, ""Listen!""-- and we're rewarded with an off-key, disharmonious keyboard mess that's perfectly logical in the context of the story, but, taken independently, makes for supremely crappy listening. So goes the whole of the record-- the music is sharp and grating, too reliant on narrative nuance, and unsure of its own role. Thus, the central problem of Rehearsing My Choir: It's a spectacular experiment, groundbreaking and perverse, bloated with possibilities and prime for parsing. But its practical function is unclear. No matter how open your mind, how welcome to art-without-directions you may be, it's difficult to consume Rehearsing My Choir without taking some kind of quasi-academic, cultural studies stance, reachable only after hours of careful, dedicated, uninterrupted listening: The emotional components are in place, but willfully (and successfully) obscured behind obtuse instrumentation and overdone wordplay. You can pick it apart, but can you dance to it, roll around on the floor with it, weep to it under your favorite blanket? This is not to say that art should be easy or instant or utilitarian-- but it should be penetrable, purposeful. And somewhere along the way, the Friedbergers got all chewed up and swallowed by their own experiment. ","A sprawling piano opera starring Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger's grandmother, Olga Sarantos, this record is every bit as terrible and fantastic as it sounds: A convoluted tangle of spoken word and keyboard gurgles, RMC is an experiment in oral history-as-pop, an extraordinarily detailed portrait of mid-century Chicago, and a magnificent failure.

There, it's finished. Did you miss it? It's very short. Less than 30 minutes. Ten tracks. Only two songs exceed three minutes. In almost any other case this would be an enormous advantage. For Rev Run, scourge of Old School haters, it's a non-factor. Writing about rap a lot, I tend to get stuck listening to overlong tropes. See, the streets need their money's worth-- Illmatic? No use for that kind of strategic brevity. ""Fill it up with those Jazze Pha beats!"" mysterious label executive says. ""They'll eat up that squirting pop-up. Bring in the next kid we're going to screw over with advance money."" Run, apparently, was having none of that. Run needs no introduction-- he's got his own TV show, is Russell Simmons' brother, hosts award ceremonies and is generally considered the most vital member of the group that took hip-hop to the rockstar level. He's a shouter and a high-energy performer. Even in middle age, on his first solo album, Distortion, he does lots of shouting. We hear you. You're Run! He's also clearly still a massive rock 'n' roll fan. Traditional rock 'n' roll. None of that Coldplay shit. He samples Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock and Roll"" and Kiss and Blondie. He's not kidding. Where Run got the money to clear a rather large, cloying sample of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" for ""Home Sweet Home"" is unknown. I'd guess his brother, but who's to say? What Hollis, Queens and Alabama have to do with each other also is unclear. This album is almost a non-entity. Throw it on on the train, it's over after four stops. The big crashing snares and remarkably self-referential songs, (""I Used to Think I Was Run"", ""Boom Ditty"") are by no means annoying. Some songs are sort of hilarious, like ""High and Mighty Joe"", a song impossibly written after 1988. Distortion may make you think you're Marty McFly, briefly. Then you'll feel like Christopher Lloyd. A person named Whiteboy produced the bulk of the album and he has a deft hand. All of the samples are cut and looped properly, the tambourines shake in the right places, the drums are blandly and precisely delivered. Run's strangled screech is dominant, if curiously angry for a man of God. His cadence is brisk, punching each line out like it were his last. What a tease Run is. The single, which you may have heard repeatedly on your local television station, but not on radios, is ""Mind on the Road"", the record that samples Joan Jett. It's about doing shows and traveling, and possibly a metaphor about the journey that is life. That much is unclear, too. I'd like to say this sort of ""Return of a Legend"" album is a waste of time. But really, what are you going to do with that 26:46?","Hip-hop legend offers a comeback mini-album that recalls late-period Run-DMC.

Night of the Hunter,Wayne B,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab99d034d5c69bf3ecd/1:1/w_160/e7023173.jpg,2005-10-23 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8806-night-of-the-hunter/,Quartermass,"Rather quietly, multi-instrumentalist Wayne B. Magruder has wended an interesting path through the blurred post-rock undergrowth. Dividing his time between NYC and Austin, Magruder has played with such acts as Bowery Electric, Main, and Windsor for the Derby, and since 1997 has been drummer/programmer for the shape-shifting indie combo Calla. Throughout these projects, Magruder has cut something of an elusive figure, with his textured contributions often hidden anonymously in the brush. And though Night of the Hunter is ostensibly Wayne B's first full-fledged solo album, even here he seems reluctant to escape his natural tendency to recede off into the music's shadows. Constructed of gauzy samples, processed lo-fi percussion, and acoustic guitar, Night of the Hunter builds a solid case in favor of organic, Four Tet-like nuance, and grainy sub-bass atmospheres. Most of the tracks here feature the cool, virtually interchangeable vocals of Jana Plewa or Daphne Gannon, and on casual listen one might easily mistake either singer to be the album's true headliner. This is due largely to the low-key, nonchalant ease with which Wayne B completes his numerous activities, as he seamlessly incorporates unfussy strands of campfire guitar or cryptic found sounds into his serene patterns without stirring a ripple. Given Magruder's background as a percussionist, it comes as a mild disappointment to hear the stiff, inconsequential beats that anchor tracks like the opening ""Souvenir"" or ""Oak (In the Small Hours)"", although both are somewhat salvaged by a surging lo-fi wash reminiscent of the lush space-rock of groups like Auburn Lull. More intriguing is ""Dogville"", whose central rhythm is also accompanied by stray percussive clatter that sounds as though it might've bled through the walls from a nearby carpenter's workshop. Midway through, the album takes a decided upward turn with the supple, dub-like pulse of ""Ten to One"", on which Magruder at last begins to assert himself with some propulsive invention. This momentum carries on through the swinging door creak of ""Garden of the Weaver"", the dusty cinema of ""Langor Train"" and the slow-motion, bottom-heavy throb of ""See Through"". During this multi-hued sequence of tracks, Magruder wisely forsakes his earlier static electronic rhythms, allowing live drums, bass, and an ever-shifting montage of veiled sound sources to produce an entrancing dry heat shimmer, like waves of sunlight reflecting off baked highway pavement. He continues on this thread for Night of the Hunter's closer, ""Back Porch Apology"", a lengthy instrumental piece that combines the album's most prominent acoustic guitar work with a suitably murky rhythmic stroke. Appropriately, this last evocative track provides the type of mesmeric, but ultimately ephemeral soundtrack that one might expect at movie's end, when the hero rides away before the audience ever gets a chance to truly know him.","Solo project from Calla's Wayne B.

Dimension Mix: A Tribute to Bruce Haack,Various Artists,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0355e6ef959693234fa/1:1/w_160/90afe9c9.gif,2005-10-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3698-dimension-mix-a-tribute-to-bruce-haack/,Eenie Meenie,"If we honored the Wright Brothers' first flight with an elaborate Blue Angels air show, would it humble their accomplishments? Better yet, how would Muhammad Ali feel if his commemoration meant having to get in the ring with Lennox Lewis? The Dimension Mix obviously intends no such harm to Bruce Haack or anyone else (in fact, proceeds from the record go to Cure Autism Now), but there's an element of ironic tragedy in hearing artists, all of whom in some way owe their success to Haack, covering the same songs that could never bring him the deserved recognition. Haack and his musical partner Esther Nelson pioneered electronic music by making vibrant, expressive children's songs during the 1960s and 70s on Haack's Dimension 5 label, and anyone from Beck to Mouse on Mars will acknowledge their indebtedness to those works. Problem is, rock history balks at lionizing children's music, if not electronic music. So if we remember Haack at all, it's most likely for showing Mister Rogers how a synthesizer works. Then again, Haack wrote some far-out shit, and expecting today's hipsters to embrace instructional songs about spiders or medieval dancing is a tad unfair. Fortunately, we have a chic laundry list of indie artists willing to upgrade some of Haack's catalog for the 21st century, acknowledging their own indebtedness to his work in the process. Beck kicks off the album with a downright incriminating rendition of ""Funky Lil' Song"", revealing his springboard for the slacker-folk dabbling of Mutations and Sea Change. Likewise, ""Liza Jane"" sheds further light on Apples in Stereo's psychedelic inspirations, proving they can cop non-Beatles artists, too. Eels offer up a surprisingly spirited cover of the Arabian-tinged ""Jelly Dancing"", even if frontman E's lecherous slow-fuzz-grind corrupts Nelson's all-too-innocent lyrics: ""Now wiggle everything you wish and shake like jelly in a dish."" But Gen X disillusionment aside, the degree of separation between Haack's crude pop songs and modern-day psych-rock is so nuanced, one listen to Oranger's take on ""Catfish"" stales many of today's purportedly ""far-out"" bands. Then there are those artists who engulf Haack's songs with their high-tech studio wizardry, creating entirely new monsters. Stereolab's ""Mudra"" mutation, which we recently frothed over in Tracks, bypasses Haack and Nelson's didacticism (""People of India often tell stories by dancing, and such a dance is called a Mudra""), instead catapulting the original's coarse electro-raga into the 28th century. DJ Me DJ You parlay similar transcendentalism, launching the already trippy ""Soul Transportation"" to the Dark Side of the Moon and back with Haack and Nelson's vocals intact for spiritual guidance. With their claustrophobic beats and turn-on-a-dime mash-ups, Fantastic Plastic Machine probably go overboard on the Dimension 5 megamix ""I'm Bruce"", but such hamming occurs regularly throughout the album. In fact, Dimension Mix's overarching sense of eagerness only testifies to Haack's expressiveness, whether in Money Mark's meticulous instrumentation to the quirky biology lecture ""Spiders"" or Danielson Famile lamenting having ""Nothing to Do"". The Beatles? Heh, they never reduced this many self-conscious artists to a second-grade reading level.","Tribute to electronic music pioneer features contributions from Stereolab, Danielson Famile, and Plastic Fantastic Machine, among others.

"How Strange, Innocence",Explosions in the Sky,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd6eb335119a49ecd5e/1:1/w_160/1ed29313.jpg,2005-10-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2881-how-strange-innocence/,self-releasedself-released,"If you wonder why Explosions in the Sky can be so emotionally deadpan, hear their newly reissued debut, How Strange, Innocence. It makes everything the band has done since look like scar tissue. Nowadays no one accuses the Texas post-rockers of vulnerability; the quartet keeps it serious as a heart attack, showing one of the best poker faces in rock. Even 2003's The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place-- a putatively optimistic response to the dour minor-key mega-wattage of its predecessor, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die-- was a strikingly humorless affair. Music this grave and resolute risks becoming a parody of itself, but the band have stood ground as if steeled for the Blitz, delivering cavernous, sure-footed instrumentals without a crumb of irony. So if you've come to depend on Royal Guard stoicism from these guys, brace yourself: How Strange, Innocence is an emotionally effluent record, all knit brows and crestfallen countenances. Earth was white to Truth's foreboding gray, the records' moods distinct like vinegar in oil. How Strange, Innocence is a more personal affair, deep cogitative blues mingling with the bleaker registers. Thank the production: Dry and brittle, the sound betrays all EITS indicators, from the wontedly windy titles (""Remember Me as a Time of Day"", ""Glittering Blackness"") to the diarrhetic runtimes. Less reverb, you'd think, less color. But Explosions' last two albums have been so bloated that the relative thinness here actually bursts open the spectrum, finding intimacy. How Strange mostly does without excessive distortion and dynamic see-sawing-- no explosions, only minor flares. But even working within a compressed range, the band conjures up some lightning. ""Magic Hours"" is eight-plus minutes for a reason: The sluggish opening section needs time to unravel if the steam-building turnabout is to have any clout. And however predictable the song's binary, quiet-crazy structure, Explosions handles both poles beautifully, moving from papery strumming and cool bass dewdrops to rushing, squall-slathered confusion. ""Snow and Lights"" cuts to the chase quicker but belabors. Starting at a climax and retreating from there, a logy middle section evaporates into a yawning abyss exactly five minutes wide. The composition's fine, all the component parts pulling weight, and the relative lack of 'verb is a good move-- any inflation would muzzle the bite. Even lacking the heavy artillery, these are no cupcakes. ""Glittering Blackness"" dirges with the best of Truth, kicking quarter notes so thick, who needs syncopation? ""Remember Me as a Time of Day"" is very proud of its acoustic guitars, whose cascading lulls presage the band's droopy meditations on the Friday Night Lights soundtrack. But whereas that foray into film scoring (the band's most recent release) moved beyond dispassionate destruction into lame docility, How Strange, Innocence does gentle from a whole different bent-- one that doesn't back down from frailty and uncertainty, and spins something way more vibrant as a result.","Temporary Residence reissues the Texas post-rockers' self-released debut.

This Bird Has Flown: A Tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4449d034d5c69bf3013/1:1/w_160/c398e4ca.jpg,2005-10-23 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1095-this-bird-has-flown-a-tribute-to-the-beatles-rubber-soul/,Razor & Tie,"Is it possible that Rubber Soul really isn't that great of an album? I don't throw this eye-catcher out as mere inflammatory rabble-rousing-- I'm not so perverse as that. But if you take a deep breath and really listen to the album, its brilliance is not so automatic, despite its importance to that transitional mid-60s pop period so many critics get heart flutters over. A few perfect gems are present, of course, but you also get trite hippie crap like ""The Word"", and a whole lot of little-boy-scorned misogyny, from blueballs-inspired arson to murder threats over suspected infidelity. The artists of This Bird Has Flown may have found this out the hard way, giddily agreeing to take part in a Beatles cover project and then finding themselves trying to do something interesting with ""Think for Yourself"". Focusing on a single album, as this compilation does, might be a good way to get some of the Beatles' less-appreciated deep cuts renewed attention, but it also forces the exhumation of tracks that would be better left uncelebrated. Fortunately, some of the participants answer this challenge by refusing to be pious or reverent with the material. Handed Ringo's abysmal country tune ""What Goes On"", Sufjan Stevens scraps everything but the lyrics, instead opting to record a really good Sufjan Stevens song, arranged for the full Illinoisemaker band with choral interludes, diving strings, and a surprisingly gritty jam. ""I'm Looking Through You"" didn't need any work, but Ted Leo gives it a cosmetic kick anyhow, leaning hard on his beloved analog delay pedal until it almost becomes dub. And if you persist, you might even get me to admit that Ben Harper's reggaefied rendition of ""Michelle""... isn't... terrible. Most of the other versions are strictly fundamentalist, with the artists backing off any significant changes to the original recording. For all I can hear, the Donnas didn't even re-record the instruments on ""Drive My Car"", settling for a straight karaoke reading. Dar Williams and Yonder Mountain String Band do little but add superfluous instrumentation and twang to ""You Won't See Me"" and ""Think for Yourself"", respectively. Subtraction doesn't work much better, as Ben Lee cruelly strips ""In My Life"" of its harmonies, while Low leaves nothing but the harmonies intact on ""Nowhere Man"". Of course, changing things around doesn't guarantee success, as the Fiery Furnaces' muddy, mistaken, Dylan-joke take on ""Norwegian Wood"" proves. A Nellie McKay restyling of ""If I Needed Someone"" as lounge-jazz isn't awful, but the same treatment has been applied to Beatles tunes countless times, and probably shouldn't be tackled again post-Shatner. Most disappointing of all is the Cowboy Junkies gender-switching reclamation of ""Run for Your Life""-- as in ""catch you with another woman, that's the end... little boy."" Dear Bands: Do. Not. Ever. Do. This. So if This Bird Has Flown gets anything right about the original Rubber Soul, it's in the sense of perfectly replicating the progenitor's unevenness. There are four or five songs worth keeping from this compilation, eight you'll never want to hear more than once, and a couple that will potentially ruin the original versions for you for a while. Whether a better choice of source material (I know, 40th anniversary, but what is that, the cobalt anniversary?) or a better choice of interpreters would have changed this distribution is anyone's guess, but with both elements less than optimal, this bird's wings were clipped from the start.","Sufjan Stevens, Fiery Furnaces, Nellie McKay, and others pay tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul.

Tanglewood Numbers,Silver Jews,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40713d1975652138bfc/1:1/w_160/706c4781.jpg,2005-10-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7163-tanglewood-numbers/,Drag City,"Few cultural moments are as indelible as the one that occurred in fin de siècle Montmartre. Capping a hill north of Paris in the 18th arrondissement, the windmill-pocked neighborhood is modernly synonymous with a spirit of free-wheeling debauchery and artistic synergy. In infamous cabarets like Lapin Agile, Le Chat Noir, and Moulin Rouge, bohemian artists and bourgeois Parisians rubbed elbows with pimps and whores amid the bawdy entertainments of Jane Avril and Aristide Bruant. No artist is more emblematic of the period than the painter and lithographer Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. David Berman invokes Toulouse-Lautrec's name in ""Punks in the Beerlight""-- ""Punks in the beerlight/ Two burnouts in love/ Punks in the beerlight/ Toulouse-Lautrec!""-- the first song on Tanglewood Numbers. With this invocation, Berman announces the aura of Tanglewood Numbers. Inextricably linked to time and place? Check. Berman's ear is still turned toward the hard-bitten rhythms and brassy twang of the American South, and his narratives still unfold in real towns and avenues. Seamy glamour? Check. Where 2001's Bright Flight leaned into full-bore country, emphasizing Berman's voice and lyrical content, Tanglewood Numbers is a band-oriented rock record-- crashing, amped-up, aggressively ramshackle. Berman's wife Cassie, with whom he seems to be developing a Waits/Brennan (or possibly Johnny/June) relationship, reprises her vocal and inspirational role (she penned the noodly dirge ""The Poor, the Fair and the Good""); Stephen Malkmus contributes some raucous, cutting guitars; drummer Brian Kotzur and keyboardist Tony Crow supply a yawing foundation; Paz Lenchantin flecks the songs with banjo and violin. These diverse players lurch into a shit-faced stumble to forge a remarkably drunken-sounding record in the angry crucible of sobriety, a rock'n'roll hayride kicking up feathers and peanut shells. The most interesting parallel between Toulouse-Lautrec's art and Tanglewood Numbers is the signature blend of jubilance and sorrow. Montmartre wasn't all fun and games by a long shot-- what was a thrilling diversion for wealthy Parisians was a harsh reality for its insolvent denizens, and in Toulouse-Lautrec's work, a sense of alienation and hopelessness undercuts the vibrant subject matter. His dingy washes of grey and green allude to the cheap, soul-hollowing aspects of taking pleasure from class division, and no two gazes or trajectories intersect, subtly isolating each of his subjects in their own existential void. Again, the parallel is striking: While Tanglewood Numbers is probably Silver Jews' most fun album to date, with its riotous guitars and rambling sing-along hooks, it's also their saddest, an outsized hangover that makes everything into sharp edges and toe-stubbing impediments, with a patina of dizzy anxiety on every blaring chord. Berman rarely gives interviews or performs, but after a recent spate of press, we all know the story-- the long party turned sinister; the rehabilitation and relapses; the eventual resurfacing into the hard, clear light of day. We see this arc play out over the course of Tanglewood Numbers, as Berman moves between sick inebriation, pissy withdrawal, grudging temperance, and a tentative state of acceptance. The first three songs are pure desperation. Over the nervously coasting guitars of ""Punks in the Beerlight"", Berman searches for the paper bag that holds the liquor in case he needs to puke. When his wife ventures some hope with the promise ""If it ever gets really really bad,"" Berman interrupts her with the addict's grim realism: ""Let's not kid ourselves, it gets really really bad."" The rollicking ""Sometimes a Pony Gets Depressed"" uses hokey barnyard imagery to veil a deeper personal point about Berman's desire for sanctuary, posing questions like, ""Where does an animal sleep when the ground is wet?"" Let's not kid ourselves; it's pretty clear who the animal in question is. And the woozily bending ""K-Hole"" finds Berman utterly succumbing to selfishness and self-destruction: ""I've been living in a k-hole ever since you went away/ I'd rather live in a trash can than see you happy with another man."" But it's around this time that a softening occurs. On the countrified duet ""Animal Shapes"", Berman's attention shifts from himself to the world around him, as he watches snow fall and muses about God carving the clouds into animal shapes. The revelatory line is ""The last dream left worth believing starts with animal shapes,"" as the addict returns to the objective world beyond his own physical sensations and the spiritual dimensions of that world. ""I'm Getting Back Into Getting Back Into You"" displays the same startled attention to a life that almost passed by unnoticed. But healing doesn't happen that quickly or cleanly, and through the unfettered elation of ""How Can I Love You if You Won't Lie Down"", and the romantic devotion of ""The Poor, the Fair and the Good"" and ""Sleeping Is the Only Love"", the album stumbles toward a complex suspension of grace and regret. Suffice it to say about ""The Farmer's Hotel"" that when Berman finally finds the shelter he's been longing for, it's not all it's cracked up to be: ""There's no natural law that can explain what I saw/ Spread out on that straw-covered floor."" The album's final song, then, is also its centerpiece, summarizing its narrative and musical arcs in one bravura performance. ""There Is a Place"" moves between placid pastoralia and stark, incantatory rock, and finds Berman in aphoristic poet-sage mode: ""There is a place past the blues I never want to see again"" and ""I saw God's shadow on this world""-- the sort of talk associated with prophets, mystics and madmen, recipients of divine visitation, apocalyptics, and near-death survivors. Peeking over the rim of oblivion and returning to tell the tale isn't a novel concept, but it's one of lasting interest, because we all want to know what's over there without having to find out firsthand. And so Berman returns, shaken but intact and leavened with hard-earned wisdom, to give us a glimpse that's so unglamorous it makes us grateful for the banal luxury we take for granted-- some good music, friends to share it with, and a warm, dry place to hear a story. ","Latest from David Berman's Silver Jews retains his signature blend of jubilance and sorrow, but is the most band-oriented rock record he's ever made.

Live It Out,Metric,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43913d197565213bee5/1:1/w_160/c26e5d80.jpg,2005-10-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5548-live-it-out/,Last Gang,"I want to like Metric, I really do. After first seeking out the band thanks to singer Emily Haines' beatific, pitch-palsied performance on Broken Social Scene's immaculate ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl"", my hopes were unrealistically high. I was inevitably disappointed with their full-length debut, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?: Its new wave spunk and blunt cynicism hardly an apt musical foundation for Haines, who I prematurely pegged as a quaint little-girl-lost indie savant. Still, the album had its moments, particularly when the singer's aching vocals and bubbly synths were brought to the fore as on the haunting ""Calculation Theme"". Clearly, this was Haines' show, and I hoped future releases would embrace that oh-so-blatant fact. Too bad then, that this sub par follow-up, with its dated post-grunge and neu-disco harangues, doesn't even measure up to Underground. Produced by guitarist Jimmy Shaw, Live It Out annoyingly revels in its rote, echo-laden aural milieu, while putting Shaw's unremarkable six-string scrapes in high relief. The press release suggests Sonic Youth's Goo as an touchstone but, directly opposed to that shifty-guitar-driven work, Live It Out is mired in a past-ripe '90s Pro Tools precision that edges dangerously close to Modern Rock tastelessness. The band's blunt liberal leanings are still the main lyrical catalyst, but rather than skewering the Orwellian state of North America with its sarcasm and biting barbs, Metric often come off as didactic and smug. ""Buy this car to drive to work/ Drive to work to pay for this car,"" goes the overly obvious and simplistic cyclical refrain to ""Handshakes"". When given the opportunity to move her band's lyrics into more winking territory live, Haines is able to deflate such over earnest musings with a cartoony thumbs-up; without that necessary context, such sentiments often miss their mark. The quartet work best when they sidestep loud guitars and lyrics for softer, more refined styles. Once again, the album's best song, ""The Police and the Private"" is a mainly Haines affair, her roundabout keyboard working in lush lockstep with her plaintive vocal melody. Mysteriously dystopic, Haines coos about a near future in which people are ""felt up and fingerprinted waiting for the train."" Tapping into modern day fears and the forever-blurred line between commerce and state, the song eschews snide snarls for a purposeful paranoia--and is all the better for it. Alas, it dodges greatness by tacking on a wholly unnecessary minute-long instrumental outro that markedly lessens its overall impact. With its silly experimental excesses (the hushed, groove disarming French whisper on ""Poster of a Girl"", nearly all of the six-minute ""Empty"") Live It Out is stymied by lame riffing and unqualified wonkage. In light of yet another brilliant collaboration with Broken Social Scene (the ineffably sweet ""Swimmers"") and the flashes of brilliance she has shown in her own band, I still think Haines has the potential to release an unapologetic indie-rock treasure. But, as this misguided disc bores out, she'll probably have to strike out on her own to do so.","Second album from band featuring BSS vocalist Emily Haines.

Popsicle,Diamond Nights,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb9eb335119a49ecade/1:1/w_160/2c6a493b.jpg,2005-10-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2618-popsicle/,Kemado,"It seems a poor depth of quality touchstones hamstrings today's arena rock revivalists, or at least maybe those not named the Darkness. Unlike heady post-punk incarnates' expansive template, nu arena rockers cull their sound from an assortment of 70s singles rather than bands per se. We can compare Diamond Nights to Thin Lizzy, but in actuality, we're really just referencing ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" since the song practically encapsulates Lizzy's prolific yet standardized canon. Such emphasis on the feel-good anthemic hit can breed either disappointment or a monlithic sound over the course of an album, and likewise Popsicle tragically toils and troubles through almost 40 minutes of lusterless AOR for one ""hit,"" ""Destination Diamonds"", already exhausted on an earlier EP. I say tragic because Diamond Nights aren't the enemy here. Unlike Louis XIV, there's no dicks-out chauvinism. Popsicle rarely even strives for anthem status, instead cruising on mid-tempo, digestible riffs and nicotine-flavored vocals. However, Diamond Nights too often splurge on guitar shop showmanship, displacing hooks and originality with intrusive, unappealing features like finger-tapped solos and Mixolydian modes. ""City of Love"" and ""Needle in the Rice"" sound like warm-up exercises, tumultuously soaring through scales and vocal modulations with little onus on structure. The other half of Popsicle's tracks float in leather-studded, ultra-cool pool hall exhaust. At best, the band drops the cock rock to dabble in more liminal genres, like on the skittish ""Drip Drip"". An almost Gang of Four-style staccato riff pecks through Morgan Phalen's volpine verses while Tim Traynor s-s-s-sputters on the skins, building to a pompous chorus ""ready for love."" Once again, ""Destination Diamonds"", from the Once We Were Diamonds EP, makes a case for these guys as Cheap Trick torch-bearers, but nothing else on the album makes good on the track's bashfully falsetto chorus hook ""Baby, do you like to mess around?"" Unfortunately, the more fetid leftovers from Diamond Nights's EP reek enough to overpower the newcomers. Amidst the rock numbskullery, acoustic numbers ""Ordinary Life"" and ""Snakey Ruth"" jumpstart Phalen's melodic side, though they're too little too late. Maybe I'm giving these guys too much credit, but baby-Sabbath throwaways like ""It's a Shokka"" and ""City of Love"" dog what otherwise seems an intelligent (they use words like ""modicum"" for chrissakes!) although misguided group. Hopefully they'll soon realize most bands conjure up only one ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" a lifetime, and rather than waiting for that generation-uniting, feel-good rocker, they'd best bend the arena rock aesthetic to its outer limits-- the band's real stomping ground.","After a Kemado EP, the 70s arena throwbacks issue their debut album.

So you can be forgiven for thinking Calla's fourth effort, Collisions, feels like a contrite set of Cliffs Notes on the drowsier end of today's indie rock. In some moments, the dense, layered guitars and crystalline bass tones gesture toward the soundscapades of Texans Lift to Experience and Explosions in the Sky and the New York-Boston cabal of groups like Codeine and Longwave. At other points, however-- such as rich but austere opener ""It Dawned On Me""-- there are hints of the more acerbic songcraft of the Wrens or earlier Death Cab. In its best moments, Collisions has an edge that's grittier and more emphatic than its predecessor. While Calla fans won't be caught off guard by the changes, the tempos are faster, the swells are louder, and generally there's a little more meat on the bone. Collisions sounds like a record born of a few studio punch-ups, with a through-the-teeth delivery and a pervading tension. This muted anger adds a welcome sonic energy-- particularly when the atmospherics seem a bit borrowed. With the exception of the occasional muted growl, Calla singer Aurelio Valle's reverb-drenched lower-register vocals smack a bit of Conor Oberst, Joe Pernice, or Elliott Smith, particularly juxtaposed against the Luna guitars of songs like ""Initiate"" or the pseudo-neo-psychedelia of ""Stumble"" and ""Swagger"". Despite the sheer familiarity of it all, Collisions is a good album. The guitar drones could be a little more bowel-shaking, some EBow could be higher in the mix, the vocals could be a bit more dry, and the lyrics could worm their way into your gut a little more ineffably, but there are some inspired sonic touches-- listen closely for well-camouflaged tambourine, organ, and harmonica popping up across the musical backdrops. The sounds are lush and beautiful-- even if they're difficult to filter down to an emotional core. It's not that Calla are particular coy or even too arch, it's just that it doesn't breathe and sweat and ache like an album that you're meant to go really gaga over. It's elegant in its perhaps unwitting syncretism but it's not something that can truly hurt you, which, when you really do scale back to Loveless or the other gilded Rosetta stones, seems to be a big part of the point: A Collisions without casualties is just a pretty collage.","Latest Calla record is grittier and more emphatic than its predecessor-- the tempos are faster, the swells are louder, and there's a little more meat on the bone.

Dreddy Krueger Presents...Think Differently Music: Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture,Various Artists,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa7ab1335d7bf169968c/1:1/w_160/7d20469d.gif,2005-10-20 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8748-dreddy-krueger-presentsthink-differently-music-wu-tang-meets-the-indie-culture/,Babygrande,"The once-dominant ""W"" is there, draped in Apple-jocking color waves. The choppy, soul-sampling production is there. RZA and GZA are there. So it's a Wu-Tang Clan record, right? Well, sorta. On Think Differently, longtime Wu affiliate Dreddy Krueger has taken a concept chock with novelty appeal-- your favorite indie rappers over Wu beats!-- and stretched it into a nearly hour-long exercise in necrophilia. If the formerly ubiquitous Clan aren't yet a hip-hop casualty, they're on life support. It's been four years since Iron Flag and four years more since one of their albums made a cultural impact. Ghostface is arguably the only one of the collective who is still turning out essential albums. But Wu-Tang has an everlasting allure. Krueger only managed to wrangle the services of three official Wu members here, one of whom is U-God, the only one I wouldn't want to meet on wax. Would it really have been so difficult to get 16 bars from, say, Masta Killa? Gripes and misleading circumstances aside, Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture is surprisingly coherent and faithful to RZA's model, and it features a few unexpectedly gleaming examples of Wu-aping. Backed by nostalgic production from Mathematics, designer of the famed W logo, and Wu tenderfoot Bronze Nazareth, each song has a stretched-out leftover appeal. Which makes sense because that's exactly what Krueger did-- he pilfered the unused Wu archives for hidden gems. The whole practice is hit-and-spliff. The tracks you think will quake, like RZA and MF Doom teaming up on ""Biochemical Equation"", or GZA and Ras Kass squaring off on the thrilling ""Lyrical Swords"" (Ras easily dominates the suddenly old Genius), are gold. Cannibal Ox's Vast Aire also makes a strong showing over the churning, sweaty harmonica boogie of ""Slow Blues"". ""I'm like Ali, better yet Joe Louis/ I'll put my hands through you/ I don't need bullets,"" he sneers. Less appealing ventures-- J-Live meets R.A. the Rugged Man, anyone?-- either feel forced or ill-conceived. ""Aesop Rock is weird and so is Del tha Funky Homosapien. Get 'em in the booth!"" This only raises an important question: What exactly constitutes ""indie"" in hip-hop right now? In indie-hop's salad days, when El-P swung a mighty sword and the word ""Rawkus"" didn't make you groan, this sort of project might have meant something. Now we're subjected to the likes of Scaramanga Shallah. These miscellaneous MCs are only indie because they can't get on commercially, not because they embody some sort of concrete ethos. This makes the whole venture bunk, though not a complete waste of time. Two interludes from Jim Jarmusch, reportedly a friend of Krueger's and the reason RZA steals Coffee and Cigarettes from Bill Murray, are bizarrely pretentious (""Harmony composes compatibility among the incongruous..."") and reason alone to give this a listen. While only a curio in the Wu archive, our friend Dreddy appears to have good intentions. It wouldn't have been a bad thing to hear some more accomplished MCs give these beats a shot; most recall a gloriously synth-less world of East Coast hip-hop production.

Presents: Guitar Duets,Joan of Arc,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0c9d034d5c69bf537b/1:1/w_160/b9cd3b03.jpg,2005-10-19 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4272-presents-guitar-duets/,"Record Label, 2000","Yup, another record by perennial Chicago snob-rock pissing alley Tim Kinsella(s) and his rotating cast of enablers. It's Presents Guitar Duets, in which 10 once/current Joan of Arc members draw names out of a trucker hat to noodle us some, hey, guitar duets. The project would seem stinky-ripe for a haha 'fork-tongued concept review -- quick, get me the top 10 PFM crits ever to give it to Kinsella with a sandpaper Durex-- but seriously, why do we hate this guy again? More to the point: Why does anyone even care? The venerable Brent D. was asked a similar question not a fortnight ago by his hunchbacked Hungarian masseuse, Ivanka. She confessed a lingering enjoyment of the first Cap'n Jazz record, the one you couldn't even get until it was reissued. She intently rubbed Brent's thigh. The new disc, she said, just seemed so relentlessly inessential-- 10 percussion-less, mathy, Brown Line-paced instrumental tendrils meandering about more like exercises than performances. Sure, Ivanka swayed slightly to the first two tracks-- the ones redolent with the autumn-rain acoustic guitar of Record Label bankroller Bobby Burg, the guy behind overlooked naïve-pop vehicle the Love of Everything. But her work suffered over the next two duets, she gave her clients spasms during the swordfishtromboner cling-clang of track 5 (""Nate Kinsella/Ben Vida"") and set her Tazo-swigging receptionist napping by the beeping climax of track 8 (""Todd Mattei/Tim Kinsella""). Recently laid off from a local unicorn abortion clinic, William Bowers' new personal trainer, DuKowski, had other ideas. Turns out things could be, have been, much, much worse. For instance: Instrumentals mean never having to hear Kinsella whine. And using the guitarists' names in song titles at least spares us Kinsella's usual flailing intellectualisms. DuKowski asked Bowers if he could feel the burn. No, but he could feel a blister, and with that turned up the volume on Chase the Devil: Religious Music of the Appalachians. Kinsella, ca. 2001: ""Why can't we stop all this blowjobishness?"" What else: A general post-post-rock malaise hangs over the whole affair, punchable as the Album Leaf, interspersed with academic John Faheyisms, clipped Michael Hedges and creaking, repetitive self-indulgence that can be heard all the way in Currituck County, Brooklyn. Almost dig the detuned finale, though. Pfork's Spencer Owen wept, Nick Mirov went on to review the Goo Goo Dolls, and one time I was in the same café as Julianne Shepherd. Anyway, who was Camilo Arturo Leslie? Brian Howe plays well with others and could probably 'splain you my quote-unquote concept: Presents: Guitar Duets is exactly this insular, somnolent and unnecessary. As for David Moore, he moved overseas and was never heard from after rhapsodizing about the (Joan of) Arcade Fire.","Ten once/current Joan of Arc members noodle us some, yes, guitar duets.

Baby,The Detroit Cobras,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97713d197565213ae6f/1:1/w_160/043f7f11.jpg,2005-10-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2298-baby/,Bloodshot,"The Detroit Cobras dovetail nicely into ""Shangri-La."" First, it's a catchall descriptor for fans of creaky old r&b; and soul singles. For them, Cobras albums are crackling pieces of heaven, combining all the music's sex and danger with the detail of an archivist. Plus, buying stuff like Baby or their memorable 1998 debut Mink Rat or Rabbit saves hours wasted trolling mildew-y record shops and the back alleys of eBay. But ""Shangri-La"" also references the Cobras' connection to Memphis and Stax/Volt, Cooper-Young cool. They're conduits for the city's soul history, but they also have a contemporary link in Greg Cartwright: Baby's co-producer and lately a fulltime Cobra, Cartwright was a member of Memphis garage rock instituions the Reigning Sound, the Oblivians, and Compulsive Gamblers, the last two of which recorded for...Shangri-La Records. That the Cobras' bash-and-slink versions of those old songs paint them as both interpreters and garage rock revivalists only completes the Shangri-la daisy chain. Baby was released on Rough Trade in the UK and Europe earlier this year, but in America it's the band's Bloodshot debut. They've picked out 12 more r&b; obscurities, but also thrown in an original, the shamelessly salacious ""Hot Dog (Watch Me Eat)"" (""You bring the drinks, and I got the buns...""). Covering old cuts of r&b; and soul as they do, you might expect Cobras vocalist Rachel Nagy to try on her damndest Carla Thomas or Aretha Franklin, or at least sing with cockeyed arm on hip. But instead Nagy sings with a cocky, slow-burn confidence that's throaty enough to handle the material but is all kinds of unique, too. Her voice places the Cobras on the cusp between purism and reinterpretation. Plus, if you want to push the intro bit even further, on ""It's Raining"" and ""Real Thing"" she suggests the dusky girl group growl of the Shangri-Las. While Nagy's delivery is the Cobras' centerpiece, much of their famously kinetic groove comes from guitars that wrangle all trebly over drumming that's heavy on cymbals and wet snare. ""Cha Cha Twist"" is part fire, part whisper, and wants to turn your living room into a clothing-optional dance party, while Bobby Womack's ""Baby Help Me"" alternates its pleading verses with big trashy chords in the chorus and still finds time to reference the Percy Sledge version with a silky bass line. The Cobras can crank out shimmy-ready numbers like ""Cha Cha"", ""Everybody's Going Wild"", and opener ""Slippin' Around"" (""We're making love 15 miles from town!"") in their sleep. But because things come easy for them, the Cobras might be tempted to coast a little-- and that's a factor on Baby. They're always raucous-- and Nagy is always on-- but the album can also leave you wondering, ""What if the Detroit Cobras covered this one or that one, or the deeper-in-the-stacks one?"" Luckily, they'll never run out of material for the very same reason. And when Nagy and the band really hit it, as on Baby's ""Weak Spot"", ""Raining"", and ""Just Can't Please You"", you're too busy reveling in a band on top of their game to wonder what they could've been doing instead.","Released last year on Rough Trade, the R&B; covers band's latest album is now issued in the U.S. as its Bloodshot debut.

Most Known Unknown,Three 6 Mafia,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ab5e6ef95969321274/1:1/w_160/67f2b159.jpg,2005-10-19 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8303-most-known-unknown/,AsylumHypnotize Minds,"Five years ago, critic Kelefa Sanneh described the Three 6 Mafia's impenetrably heavy gothic-crunk sound as ""a roomful of drunks arguing with an early Steve Reich record."" Five years later, not much has changed. For more than a decade, the Memphis collective has been perfecting an impossibly thick and dark form of Southern rap. Nearly every track consists of the same ingredients: ghostly, glistening horror-movie synths, churning orchestral strings, enormously deep drum sounds, fuck-you-up gang chants, and violent knucklehead lyrics delivered in thick, wet, swollen Southern accents. If that sounds tedious, then that's sort of the point; Three 6 Mafia are an immersion thing. Like Lungfish or the Boredoms, Three 6 Mafia producers DJ Paul and Juicy J understand the psychedelic properties of repetition. Over the course of an album, these tracks pile up on top of each other and become a kind of narcotic haze, a blissfully paranoid house of mirrors, a world unto themselves. By the time of 2003's stunning Da Unbreakables, the group had its approach down to a science. Everything on that album was so slow and hard and ominous that it practically bent the air. The group had winnowed its once-huge lineup down to four, and everything that they did sounded practiced and weathered and calculated, like they'd spent years figuring out exactly how to raise heart-rates and explode trunks. Something else happened in 2003, though: crunk blew up. The slower, darker end of the stuff that made its way to the radio (Lil Scrappy's ""No Problem"", Crime Mob's ""Knuck If You Buck"") was heavily and obviously indebted to the Three 6, but the group remained a regional empire, huge stars in Memphis and little-known outside the South. Promising Three 6 protgs like Lil Wyte and Frayser Boy made great records, but you weren't about to see them on MTV. On the spoken introduction to Most Known Unknown, DJ Paul explains the title: ""Three 6 Mafia is known, but at the same time, they unknown. We got a lot to do with what's going on in hip-hop today, but niggas don't realize it."" But the album's opening song and first single, ""Stay Fly"", is a curious departure. The song finds the group's members rapping in double-time instead of their usual slow, slurry cadences, collaborating with fellow Tennessee rappers Eightball, MJG, and Young Buck instead of their own circle of friends, and, most shockingly, using the skittering percussion and tear-stained strings of dusty soul rather than the minor-key John Carpenter pianos they've been leaning on for years. It's a strong single, but it was also an unsettling sign that Paul and Juicy might be trying to become Kanye West. But despite a new fondness for dusty r&b; samples, Paul and Juicy have kept the black-hole stomp that has always made them great. Most Known Unknown is the group's most melodic album, but these lighter touches perfectly compliment the old eeriness. On ""Swervin'"" a gorgeous harp line floats above a storm of low, distorted bass, while the light, sprightly violins of ""Side 2 Side"" rub up against the stomp-stomp-clap drums perfectly. And ""Poppin' My Collar"" is just a beautiful song, its soaring strings and choral vocals offset just right by a slow, hard beat. Most Known Unknown doesn't carry the punch of Da Unbreakables (it's hard to top a posse cut built on a ""Carmina Burana"" sample), but Paul and Juicy's lighter touch makes for a few unexpectedly moving moments. The group is now down to a trio, but those three guys have great voices: DJ Paul's weathered bark, Juicy J's wet, percussive under-the-beat slur, Crunchy Black's nasal, singsong rasp. The lyrics remain in full dumbshit slap-you-up mode; my favorite line is DJ Paul's ""Haters shaking like booties in the strip club/ I'll cut ya head off like Al-Qaeda in this bitch, what!"" This can occasionally veer into truly sickening eruptions of misogyny; the rape narrative that Paul throws on ""Let's Plan a Robbery"", especially, is unforgivable. But as a purely aesthetic experience, Most Known Unknown is like a summer thunderstorm-- gorgeous and humid and dangerous.","Now a trio, the Memphis collective continues to perfect its impossibly thick and dark Southern rap.

Thumbsucker OST,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7039d034d5c69bf36b5/1:1/w_160/04120d25.gif,2005-10-19 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7897-thumbsucker-ost/,Hollywood,"As summer turns to fall in the cinematic season, it has become traditional for studios to wheel out indie coming-of-age films. Since we've been around this block before, we know to expect certain things from the soundtracks of these films, be they focused on teenage crisis, quarter-life crisis, mid-life crisis, or some combination of these infinite crises. Any compiler knows that a delicate mix of childlike whimsy and bittersweet melancholy is a must, not to mention a dusted-off, neglected oldie that summarizes the film's themes, and maybe a few covers, for good measure. Thumbsucker is clearly aware of these requirements, and given director Mike Mills' illustrious career in music video production, his rolodex should have been more than up to the challenge of filling out the OST. He started by courting Elliott Smith, who was originally pegged to provide all of the film's music. Smith's erratic work rate delayed the proceedings, and his death halted them, forcing Mills to draft in the Polyphonic Spree, perhaps thinking he could at least save the money it would've cost to hire an orchestra. To their credit, Tim DeLaughter's robed crew are adept at the whimsy part of the recipe stated above, as anyone who's heard their relentlessly optimistic brand of sun-cult music can attest. Though the format doesn't allow the Spree to indulge their usual slow-build dynamics, the band nevertheless finds the space to use all of their many parts, handing most of the vocals to their choir and letting the strings, horns, etc. flit around the borders. But with rarely more than a minute or so to unfurl, the songs lack heft, sounding a little like jingles for correspondence art schools and new-age massage centers. However, as far as the Spree doing the melancholy part: Eh, not so much. Attempts at gravitas sound overly forced and unnatural for the band, with DeLaughter putting on his best Ben Gibbard impression for ""Sourness Makes It Right"" and the choral smiles being poorly hidden on ""Wait and See"". Fortunately, Mills was able to salvage three demo-ish songs done by Smith, tremulous takes on Big Star's ""Thirteen"", Cat Stevens' ""Trouble"", and his own ""Let's Get Lost"". ""Thirteen"" is clearly the best of these, reverently remade as it is, Smith adding another sedimental layer of sadness to undercut Alex Chilton's already-longing adolescent reminiscences. But as accompaniment to a movie about a troubled teenager and his relationships, it's not the most subtle of soundtracking gestures. Lack of subtlety is something that plagues the entire score, not surprising given the rainbow sledgehammer tactics of the Polyphonic Spree. In the end, this lack of grace is what keeps Thumbsucker's OST from joining the ranks of excellent indie soundtracks alongside The Virgin Suicides, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and anything Mark Mothersbaugh has done for Wes Anderson. The Polyphonic Spree, despite attempts to pare down their sound and numbers when appropriate, can't help but be too intrusive for cinematic usage, inserting themselves into scenes like that episode from ""Scrubs"", rather than providing constructive background color.","Mike Mills feature film includes the work of Elliott Smith and the Polyphonic Spree.

Playing the Angel,Depeche Mode,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96a13d197565213ae51/1:1/w_160/cea74da0.jpg,2005-10-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2285-playing-the-angel/,Mute,"First things first: You can count me among that class of people who haven't paid the closest attention to Depeche Mode over the past, umm, decade. I don't imagine this is all that unusual. Sure, the music they've released seems fine enough. But laying claim to our brainspace takes more than that, and each album these guys produced seemed to be slotting them further and further into that place where groups just naturally wind up after a couple decades as a going concern-- the band version of adulthood. Band adulthood is where you've settled into enough of a groove that your core fans know who they are, and everyone else happily ignores your continued existence. Band adulthood is where you make perfectly fine and increasingly subtle and sophisticated new albums, and your members embark on highly touted Significant Solo Projects-- neither of which anyone can really work up any enthusiasm about. Band adulthood means reviews that are a big swirl of stock phrases like ""return to form"" and ""just may be their best since [insert classic here]""; it's a world of die-hard fans politely trying to convince everyone that actually, this new album, it's interesting, you should give it a listen. Band adulthood is a city where R.E.M. and Elvis Costello have offices downtown, and the Cure and New Order keep stopping by open houses in the suburbs. No mistake: people of all sorts still love their Depeche Mode; last year I even got to watch a 19-year-old metalhead dig back and convert. But people want their prime-era DM, not a paler adulthood. Even the titles of the band's last couple releases seemed to know it: after Ultra (!) and Exciter (!), I'm half-surprised they didn't manage to call one No Really, We're Still Worth It. If you've caught any advance word on Playing the Angel, you'll probably have heard the same rumors that swirl around all band-adulthood records: That this is the one, the ""return to form."" That this isn't just the ""best since Violator,"" but maybe even just as good. That they're about to pull off the same trick Morrissey did-- following the same path as always, and yet somehow getting everyone to sit up again and take notice. (Publicists help.) And while I wish I could take some bold, controversial true/false stance on that one, this album just won't let me. If you really are the sort of person who's been waiting with bated breath for a new Depeche Mode release, then don't worry: You'll love this. Dear everyone else: It's pretty okay. It certainly sounds as good as anything they've done in a while-- and isn't that always the key with these things? Band-adulthood records leave everyone in fear of limp retreads, embarrassingly bombastic attempts to capturing former glory, ill-advised experiments, laughable bandwagon-jumping, or that ultimate horror of classic acts trying to ape the bands they're meant to have influenced. Depeche Mode have long managed to avoid those traps (say, ""showing Linkin Park how it's really done""), and on this record they've done even better, hitting on something that feels solid and relevant and natural: a dense, buzzy web of sound that folds in the old arena anthems, the camp noir-gospel of the early 90s, and the polished micro-production of Exciter. The whole problem of the ""new"" DM has always been the gap between the clean-lined synth clang of their prime era and the lush, fussy computer-assisted electronics of today; the most surprising tracks here shoot past that issue entirely. ""Precious"", the first single, works some slow-rolling ""Enjoy the Silence"" beauty-- but the whole thing's riding on burbling acid-synth lines, retro-classic and up-to-the-minute at the same time. ""John the Revelator"" does up-tempo ""Master and Servant"" pulse and ""Condemnation"" choir calls over ultra-modern bleep and click, ""A Pain That I'm Used To"" does slow industrialist grind, and some other tracks pull off something like Depeche Mode torch songs. Yes, they've got their style working, their production mostly down, and Dave Gahan's singing gets richer and better with each passing record. Only here's the thing: Surely a pop album lives or dies by its songs. And while the sounds here, apart from some sterile ""modern"" clicks and flourishes, climb their way past the pitfalls of the 25-year-old band, the songs here can't. Give any songwriter a couple decades, and the same things will happen-- the writing gets progressively more subtle, more sophisticated, until eventually it's curiously free of spark, always skirting the obvious old hooks in favor of something too professional to even notice. It's all here: the arch, wandering melodies; the methodically constructed key changes; the weirdly formless slow-and-quiet epics; the standard lyrical stew of religion and lust and fragile, innocent, faithful things in a dark, dark world. Yes, this group has spent the past 15 years trading in mood and atmosphere-- much more so than the relentlessly tight pop of their 1980s arena days. Yes, given enough time, they'll gather up into something passably engaging. No, no one's asking for karaoke classics. But none of the moods and atmospheres and slow-growers here stand much of a chance of reaching out and drawing you in-- or of making a believer out of anyone who didn't believe already. The end product, then, is one of those signature artifacts of the Adult Band: an album we hardly even need to review. Depeche Mode's core fans will flip for it; it's the best thing they've released in a long while. Everyone else? It's pretty okay. And these days, over a decade since Songs of Faith and Devotion, well, you already know which of those two camps you fall into.","Synth-pop legends' first album in four years aims to match the mood and quality of their Violator-era sound.

Young Adults Against Suicide,Ninja High School,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b989c0084474cd0c2626/1:1/w_160/a7bad7df.jpg,2005-10-18 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5922-young-adults-against-suicide/,Tomlab,"If you can leave behind the pesky reverence to the genres they swipe from, you might have as much fun as Ninja High School do on their debut. Stealing the party vibe from Golden Age hip-hop and the bratty arrogance of church-basement hardcore, Ninja High School leave the weight behind and make an album with a sharp ear and a positive, inclusive atmosphere. From the first track of Young Adults Against Suicide, atonal mechanized bleeps bump uglies with funk basslines, and hip-hop beats meet with hardcore shouts-- all behind a barrel of quirky vocal samples. ""Jam Band Death Cult"" is a smooth, crafty pastiche of laid-back horns, gentle piano, and foot-tapping beats. There are barbershop quartet harmonies on a chorus about people wasting the band's time, while the group shouts, ""Shut the fuck up/ This is what's up"" through distorted mics with as much arrogance as exuberance. The music is strangely buried in the mix, covered in a nostalgic haze, so it's the tag-team rapping and shouting that makes or breaks the record. To that end, the group displays more competence than personality. What are they shouting about? Not much. Jabber about who's the best band in the land, who's going home in ambulance, where the fucking party is at, and so on. They get close to a manifesto on ""Feverish Dream"" (opening with a line about crucifying Ian Mackaye and burying the Velvet Underground once and for all), but politics are not the band's strong suit. The glitch-addled tribute to Harry Belafonte on ""Nap"" is probably more sincere. Young Adults Against Suicide doesn't say ""Let's tear walls and preconceptions down,"" it says ""Party all right good times let's go fuck yeah."" (Just look at it as an acronym-- ""YAAS!"") It's the irreverent spirit that translates more than the content, and it works when the end result a party record, no less and no more. The first few tracks establish the modus operandi, and the band becomes progressively more daring toward the record's center. After the aforementioned ""Nap"", ""Shake it Off"" merges the bassline from Talking Heads' ""Naive Melody (This Must Be the Place)"" with a ridiculously long ad-libbed scream, while asking the crowd to ""let the fucking sunshine in"" and then, of course, to shake-shake-shake-shake-shake-shake it off. With a little more emphasis on finding great beats instead of being the number one party-starters, the record could have avoided petering out in the final third. Not that there's any horrific missteps, or even a change in approach; It's just that the sugar rush has dissipated before the 12th track comes around.","Tomlab band combines the party vibe of old-school hip-hop and the bratty arrogance of church-basement hardcore.

Liz Janes & Create(!),Liz Janes,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb445e6ef95969322b8e/1:1/w_160/bc8be4e1.jpg,2005-10-18 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4349-liz-janes-create/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Nominated for the San Diego Music Awards as Best New Artist in 2004, Liz Janes harbors more in common with San Diego's most visible wetsuit-to-riches tales than she probably knows or wants to believe: Chronic jokester Jason Mraz-- even surfboard-bearing Christian-rockers Switchfoot-- share Janes' penchant for sounding none too stressed and being nuisances to pigeonhole. But Janes' So Cal roots thankfully don't dig too deep, and her influences fan out further. She cites Casey Kasem's Top 40 as influential, and names ties to the suburbs of D.C., jazz clubs of Philadelphia, and punk of Olympia, Wash.-- all forces that habitually manifest themselves in previous efforts, Done Gone Fire and Poison and Snakes. Released on Sufjan Stevens' Asthmatic Kitty label (the former was produced by Stevens), both of her previous albums at once court and thwart expectations of Ms. Wanderlust and Mr. America's collaboration-- and both are so sprawling that they're frequently frustrating. Though the issue at hand is too many cooks, it isn't Stevens' doing on Done Gone Fire, or Rafter Roberts' on Poison & Snakes. It's the schizo-stuff Janes throws in, intentionally or otherwise, that emerges seductively bluesy Jesus-lovin' indie pop, largely unremarkable and unfocused, and warbly to a fault. Janes' purposeful strangeness might be beautiful-- her stabs at tradition, valuable-- if done right. On her latest album, Janes is joined by Los Angeles-based free jazz collective Create(!) with whom she eschews soulful pseudo-folk cuteness and reinterpret six spirituals and folk standards to door slams and trash can lid noises. Sufjan takes a leave of absence, and so does his aforementioned bells and whistles; produced and recorded by Chris Schlarb of Create(!) in a one-room shack, Liz Janes & Create(!) banishes use of electric-instruments and remedies Janes' most irksome faults. Here Janes drops the affected Baez-warble, and Create(!) provide the strangeness she sometimes slaves too hard to arrive at; together, they revamp tradition to construct something strangely new, and surprisingly personal. For better or for worse, this album creates the impression of spanning for ages in its under-half-an-hour run. There's little room to err, but they still manage: ""Lonesome Valley"", ""Be My Husband"", and ""All the Pretty Horses"" would lull tiny hippie babies to sleep in two minutes, tops. Janes sings ""Go to sleep, little baby,"" and problematically, it works too well. By the time ""Jesus Is a Dying Bed-Maker"" ups the pace, the attention-deficient will have fled before hearing Janes' sweetly admonishing ""well, well, well""; too bad, because it's here that Janes draws closest to stunning.","Asthmatic Kitty singer-songwriter teams with the Los Angeles-based free jazz collective.

The Last Romance,Arab Strap,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f2b1335d7bf169812c/1:1/w_160/809d9e00.jpg,2005-10-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/275-the-last-romance/,Chemikal Underground,"For the men of Arab Strap, the concept of romance has always been a favorite joke. Over the course of their discography, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have explored romance as an abstract notion constructed of the sordid lies people tell in order to pair off and-- as Aidan put it in one variation-- ""go home and make a mess."" On The Last Romance, their sixth proper studio album, Arab Strap present another song cycle detailing the craggy terrain that separates gloriously tawdry, dead-end sex from more lasting, mature (i.e. boring) relationships. But this time something wholly unexpected occurs, as the duo's notorious self-deprecating gloom here begins to lift, allowing the briefest rays of romantic comfort and satisfaction to flicker in the distance. Throughout The Last Romance, Arab Strap's more familiar lyrical themes are thankfully bolstered by their boldest and most assured music to date, as they build confidently on the advances made on 2003's Monday at the Hug & Pint. Gone entirely are their once-frequent plunky drum machines, replaced by a skillfully balanced array of piano, strings, and horns. And though as a vocalist Moffat remains his curmudgeonly limited self, never before have his vocals been so thoughtfully integrated into Middleton's arrangements-- check the way his croon expertly mirrors the cello on ""Confessions of a Big Brother""-- giving these performances an effortless, dyed-in-wool cohesion that their earlier pint-fuelled narratives sometimes lacked. Over the years, Arab Strap have recorded an astonishing number of songs set in beds with dirty sheets, so the sleazy jolt of ""Stink"" opens The Last Romance in well-established territory, and with Moffat's customary disinterest in foreplay. ""Strangers waking up in the Monday morning stink/ Of course I feel sick, but it's not why you think,"" he sings over formidably roiling guitars, postponing for a moment the album's newfound streak of tenderness. Equally uneasy are tracks like the propulsive ""(If There's) No Hope For Us"" and ""Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003"", a heartsick, drumless mutter which eventually opens out into impressively dissonant smears of guitar while Moffat glumly intones, ""If we're having so much fun than how come I'm crying every Monday?/ Is it just to cancel out the laughter from Thursday 'til Sunday?"" It's on the aforementioned ""Confessions of a Big Brother"" that The Last Romance takes a deliberate turn, as Moffat begins to dole out the do-as-I-say-not-as-I've-done advice like a pub-bound St. Augustine: ""Try and be a gentleman, always tell the truth/ I'm not just a hypocrite, I'm jealous of your youth."" Evidently taking this solemn, introspective counsel to heart, the duo move promptly through some of the most warm-hearted material in their history, starting with the affectionate pillow talk of ""Come Round and Love Me"" (""It's on the tips of our tongues, but who'll be the first one to say it?"") and the wry, pro-monogamy pummel of ""Speed Date"". On the piano-driven ""Dream Sequence"", the album's lead single, Arab Strap-- to their everlasting chagrin, no doubt-- even approach something of Coldplay's atmospheric sweep, although Chris Martin has certainly never demonstrated Aidan's overall ability to use the word ""fuck"" with such invention. Later, as the raucous, album-closing ""There Is No Ending"", achieves a brassy, Pogues-like swell, Moffat comes to identify romance as a curious, but welcome form of surrender: ""If you can love my growing gut, my rotten teeth and graying hair/ Then I can guarantee I'll do the same as long as you can bear."" And though such optimistic sentiments might initially sound jarring to those familiar with Moffat's cultivated persona as the surly bard of hungover, carnal ennui, The Last Romance should stand as proof that a little sunlight might just do Arab Strap some good.","On their sixth album, the Scottish duo's self-deprecating gloom here begins to lift, allowing rays of romantic comfort and satisfaction to flicker in the distance.

Yet, recently, the aesthetic has enjoyed a more jovial reception by the press and from indie rock fans-- thanks in large part to Wolf Eyes, Black Dice, and Lightning Bolt. This critical feedback has allowed noise bands to go on increasingly lengthier tours with larger audiences at each stop, and those higher-profile peers have fostered a larger, less incestuous noise community. For Lightning Bolt's Brian Gibson and Brian Chippendale, fortuitous cultural circumstances and their improvisational acumen have rendered them the toast of the current noise-rock crop-- all the while they've continued to tweak their post-hardcore/Harry Pussy formula. Hypermagic Mountain is Lightning Bolt's fourth, most well-oiled album: song-by-song it chugs into rockier Van Halen, Fucking Champs, or Orthrelm territory. Somewhere in the middle a lack of variety creates a dull patch, but even the more homogenized tracks slip by on the upped energy as well as subtle, virtuostic additions to the violence. The set was again captured by ex-Small Factory jangle-popper Dave Auchenbach, who mostly harnesses the band live to two-track (with some live mixing) and DAT. Because of the approach, Hypermagic Mountain breathes like a battering ram: The drums are gargantuan and, conversely, the vocals fold nicely into the buzz. The sound's crowded-- the Boschian cover art is a solid visual analogue-- but Lightning Bolt make room for all their key ingredients: brief space excursions, lessons in dynamics, monster riffs, semi-humorous politicos, sugar-dosed energy. Everything you'd expect to find is here and in amped form-- festering bass (with that slippery balloon sound) and machete-slinging, crazy-climber drums. The components establish LB as more rock, less noise-- though they've always treaded closer to that realm than to Merzbow or Whitehouse. The Brians' break the gate with ""2 Morro Morro Land"", upchucking a noodle before opting for the overdrive of a jaunty lick. The heavier, somehow portentous ""Captain Caveman"" connects for a second punch with Chippendale shouting somewhere in the midst of the commotion that ""this is the anthem."" Well, actually, it's one of many. The next movement's spacier, focusing on ghosts: ""Riffwraiths"" and ""Mega Ghost"" include more entropic loops and echoed vocals-- especially on ""Mega"", which begins ambiently with dead-soul vocal echo. Fittingly, the first few minutes of zoomed drums and bass on ""Magic Mountain"" sound like an uphill climb. Like the best of immediate-minded rockers, LB kindly deliver. So no, none of that avant-noise tease: Despite still working on the outer edge of rock dynamics, when LB build to something, you can be assured it'll explode. Elsewhere, there are anti-Bush theme papers (""Dead Cowboy"") and sludgy bass over cryogenic drums and brackish vocals (""Mohawk Windmill""). Continuing in the vein of lovely slower pieces-- i.e. Wonderful Rainbow's ""Hello Morning"" or the title track; Ride the Skies' ""The Faire Folk""-- ""Infinity Farm"" is pitched pulsation and rattle with mellow baby squawk vocals. Think Black Dice and a little coterie of puppies. As I just confirmed by peeking out my Brooklyn window, heavy metal's enjoying hipster popularity; it's entirely imaginable Lightning Bolt could impress fans of that middle world with this rock-oriented sound. But even with added hooks and sharper flavors, LB's previous release, Wonderful Rainbow, still possesses more variety and a certain je ne sais squall. So where does Hypermagic Mountain rest in the canon? Like the opening train ride of Thomas Mann's novel Magic Mountain, it finds the band climbing toward some unknown peak, and while it attains great heights, there's also a now-again sound of wheels spinning, and every reason to believe LB still haven't reached their ultimate destination.","Noise duo's fourth album was mostly recorded live to two-track (with some live mixing); as a result, the sound is more crowded and more amped than their previous efforts.

Analord 9 / 10 / 11,AFX,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ca5e6ef9596932002c/1:1/w_160/25b07ec1.jpg,2005-10-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11637-analord-9-10-11/,Rephlex,"Now 11 records into what was expected to be a 10-platter set, even the most fervent Richard D. James worshippers might be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed, bored, or apathetic by the Analord series. While the results have proved intermittently brilliant, only occasionally dull, and generally better than 2001 faith-shaker Drukqs, no one seems to agree what's what. There may be a hidden master plan yet, but the master sure seems to be coasting. With the release of his latest triad, James has reached a (temporary?) stopping point. Analord 10 actually came first last December, but it's been re-issued as a logo-bearing picture disc, and what does order matter when the man's latest sounds like his earliest? Each of the Analord releases adopts the AFX moniker, analogue synth sounds and even inscrutable titles he used in his early '90s Analogue Bubblebath acid-house recordings. (Except the original 10th, i.e. first, which was released as Aphex Twin. Got it?) Analord 10 remains the best of the new EPs so far. It's not hard to see why listeners who'd already dished out 40 quid for this record might have gone on to order the collection's later, less-inspiring discs. A-side ""Fenix Funk 5"" alternately buzzes and reclines, incorporating garbled, vocoder-like noises, and gently descending chimes along with energetic drum machines. The dense, dark seven-plus minutes of bell-tolling B-side ""Xmd5a"", still more melodic than most acid but playing hard to get, make it probably the series' best track. OK, some consensus, then. Meanwhile, Analord 11 is colder, sadder, and less satisfying. Its two tracks, like those on the eighth and ninth outings, are named after viruses and spyware. A-side ""W32.Mydoom.Au@mm"" whines and moans over steady handclaps and padded cymbals like an electronic plea for help-- whether with musical ideas or personal life, it's far from clear. On the flip, ""Backdoor.Ranky.S"" layers drooping synths over a steady boom-pah rhythm, squelching lazily and unnecessarily toward the upper registers as the tune fizzles out. Analord 9-- comprising four tracks rather than the nine fakes originally leaked to file-sharing networks-- ups the BPMs, with skittering hi-hats galore. Bouncy ""Backdoor.Netshow"" is the highlight, panning left and right as a scratchy sawtooth eventually joins, then drowns in effects. As many of you know, James is far from the only electronic artist going back to the Phuture-- a full-fledged acid revival has been going on for a while now, exemplified by the likes of Luke Vibert, Atom Heart, and a series of inevitable mostly welcome compilations-- but his following expects him to do more than just partake in the latest craze. According to pernicious rumor, dozens more Analord tracks are in the vault.What else has James got up his sleeve? What does it all mean? WWRDJD? No epiphanies here, but the canny bastard keeps us hanging on.","RDJ concludes his year-long acid revival 12"" series.

We're Animals,Numbers,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4475e6ef95969323a0b/1:1/w_160/aab2dca3.jpg,2005-10-17 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5867-were-animals/,Kill Rock Stars,"Since the dust from the great Chris Ott vs. William Bowers battle settled, the buzz around Numbers has been pretty drab. Back in 2002, you had a blast either shellacking or safeguarding the San Fran trio's fidgety post-punk debut Life, respectively aligning with the Ott or Bowers camps. Question is: How did Numbers ever cause such ballyhoo? Perhaps with the upsurge of ""The ____s"" bands, indie gatekeepers felt obligated to strike preemptively. Whether that meant sabotaging any possible cash-in with retro-crazed MTV2 and NME or being the first to herald tomorrow's potential ""it"" band, Numbers dubiously pitted brother against brother in a war way bigger than its cause. So that's the history; here's the neatly packaged blurb: Numbers gleefully rehash excitable late 70s bands like Devo and XTC, their buoyancy unfazed by the unoriginal, derivative material. Considering Numbers' lack of divulged material (their first two true LP's combine for less than 45 minutes), We're Animals feels like the long-awaited main event after two sneak previews, and the payoff is-- power-pop, sort of. It's like suddenly these guys believe they're the New Pornographers. We're Animals comes chock full of bubblegum hooks, vocal harmonies, and tripartite rock song structures (Gasp...bridges!). Unfortunately, Numbers' newfound Ritalin-treated sound doesn't mean more ideas, just longer ones, and the result is about as fun as an overstretched Slinky. Topographically, the album resembles a grim cardiogram printout-- generally flat with a few spiked moments of nervy chaos. Opener ""Beast Life"" jerks you from point A to B, though the actual sections they divide play it safe technically. Lead singer Indra Dunis's incoherent squalls are also scrapped, supplanted by droning nursery rhyme cadences similar to Deerhoof's Satomi. ""Funny But Sad"" goes sing-song, Kim Deal-style, recalling the airy, simple verses of ""I Bleed"" and ""Invisible Man"". Despite a helter-skelter breakdown, the track ends with a campy call-and-answer titular chorus complemented by intermittent shouts of ""I laughed!/ I cried!"" The emphasis to melody on We're Animals is reminiscent of off-kilter mutant disco hits such as ""I Know What Boys Like"". On ""The Fuck You Garage"", Dunis stoically half-sings, half-chants ""I know it well/ It looks like hell"" over a clumsy moog riff, eventually crash landing the song headfirst into a catatonic anti-chorus. Here, the struggle between saccharine pop, deceptively saccharine pop and classic bloody nose punk becomes most apparent. We're Animals still has haywire guitars, bushwhacking rhythms, and those homemade synthesizers we're always hearing about, but the real story is the band's conflicted strategy for melody. Sadly, Numbers too often chicken-hearts, stifling catchiness immediately after having blunted a song's jittery fun beyond repair.","KRS band gleefully rehash excitable late-70s bands like Devo and XTC.

Dream Brother: The Songs of Tim and Jeff Buckley,Various Artists,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d8c0084474cd0c0368/1:1/w_160/72a9967f.jpg,2005-10-17 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/996-dream-brother-the-songs-of-tim-and-jeff-buckley/,Full Time Hobby,"Maybe conflating the histories of Tim Buckley and his son Jeff together for co-biograpghy Dream Brother was a good idea, giving both of their life stories a new context. I don't know, I didn't read it. But combining the material of both Buckleys for a tribute record-- not to mention casting the net beyond folk or rock-- inevitably makes for a mixed bag. The faithful: Most of the Tim Buckley covers strive in different ways to compensate for his distinctive, nimble voice. Magic Numbers imitate his swaying stop-start pace through ""Sing a Song For You"", imbued with their trademark sibling harmonies. They leave it with their personal stamp, but what was once so impeccably graceful is now a bit too precious with those breathy higher harmonies. Elsewhere, the Earlies' ""I Must Have Been Blind"" lays it on thick with a wall of vocal harmonies and wide-armed slow claps to reach the heights of Tim's original vocal. Sufjan Stevens takes on ""She Is"", and wisely moves the spotlight away from his limited voice and onto the arrangement, where he excels. The usual banjo and sparkling clean electric guitar are there, lifted by layers of airy woodwinds that hit untapped potential in the original. On the younger Buckley's side, Adem takes a brave one-man acoustic attempt at ""Mojo Pin"", keeping every note the same, and his able voice is the closest match to either Buckley (and sounds almost like father covering son). Stephen Fretwell's ""Morning Theft"" is a bit too faithful, dragged down in gushy sentimentalism, and points out the door Jeff left open for one too many amateur romantics. The departures: Micah P. Hinson's confidently sung yet peculiar take through Jeff's ""Yard of Blonde Girls"", adding layers and building in volume as if it were one of his private demos, a perky back-porch pluck with no reverence to Jeff's grinding glam-happy original. King Creosote's ""Grace"" limits itself to accordion and simple acoustic strumming, yet nails the existential woe of the original without the vocal histrionics. The not-so-departurous departures: The Engineers' ""Song to the Siren"" sounds a whole lot like the Engineers. The mixed bag: The inclusion of artists like Matthew Herbert and Bitmap might make the disc more diverse, but it dissolves the focus. I'd have liked to hear a record of new sensitive folkies who feel the influence of Tim and admiration for Jeff. Bitmap's ""Dream Brother"" adds a thin coat of robot funk while leaving the structure unscratched. The new ""Everybody Here Wants You"" wipes the slate clean, and while the cooing vocals of Dani Siciliano and the slinking beat are a nice counterpoint to the original's exaggerated sensuality, the result is cold and aimless. The surprises: Tunng deconstruct ""No Man Can Find the War"" to stunning effect, leaving fleet fingerpicking and low harmonies over subtle electronic percussion, with a casual delivery that makes the grim imagery of the lyrics even darker. Kathyrn Williams turns her scratchy limited range to an advantage, and her minimal, sunny take on ""Buzzin' Fly"" is easily most charming track. Maybe I'm wrong on the modern folk angle; the best tracks on Dream Brother are from artists who ignored expectations and dared to be themselves-- flaws and all.","Tribute album to Tim and Jeff Buckley features Sufjan Stevens, Matthew Herbert, and the Magic Numbers, among others.

The Days of Mars,Delia Gonzalez and Gavin Russom,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc6eb335119a49ecafa/1:1/w_160/25cf0cde.gif,2005-10-17 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2628-the-days-of-mars/,DFA,"New York transplants Delia Gonzalez and Gavin Russom-- the DFA duo who don't play dance punk, noise, or death disco (except when performing as Black Leotard Front)-- are keeping busy by playing art gallery installations and skipping stones across the same cosmic lake as forefathers Tangerine Dream, Terry Riley, and stone cold Mike Oldfield. In some other universe (which they are doubtlessly exploring in between building analog synthesizers and soundtracking video art), they are superstars, riding the wave of meta-consciousness, outlining patterns that only make sense when you look at them a millions miles away. The dancers in this universe don't need hooks, because hooks only interrupt the flow. But what do Gonzalez and Russom sound like here and now? Is it enough to re-master forms mastered thirty years ago by people with a lot fewer expectations for sounding cool? And is post-modernism here to eat us all and throw away the bones? The short truth is ""no, with a but"": If you're looking for flawlessly crafted minimalism, no less spacey than any of the duo's professed influences (throw in New Age pioneer Vangelis for good measure), The Days of Mars delivers. In fact, in terms of the genre, its four expansive pieces should be held as models of textbook precision. However, I can't shake the feeling that there's something missing. Though not a note is wasted, or drone abused, there's opacity to the music that ultimately leads me feeling a little malnourished. Of course, I also can't shake the feeling that I've heard this before, but that's not the root of why it doesn't stick: Maybe Gonzalez and Russom are craftspeople in a pool of artists. Or, maybe there really is only so much that can be wrung from a single chord progression-- but no, that's actually one of their strengths, treading the milky regions of The Singularity, perfectly at home with both advanced technology and the primordial One. No, I think the main problem with the album is that unless I make a conscious (or chemically enhanced) decision to invest myself in it, it seems just pleasant and as ephemeral as dark matter. That said, I can't fault it on purely musical grounds. The late 2003 single ""Rise"" vibrates like a strobe light, with synthesized open fifths and the distant ring of overtones created by the natural resonance of layers upon layers of electronic tones. The minor-key (or more accurately, ""mode""-- this kind of harmony both predates and usurps traditional keys) figures operate in almost complete symbiosis, each connected to the last; should one fall apart, the whole piece changes color. Of course, willing participants will find it abundantly hypnotic, but even if you want to use ""Rise"" as background music, an orchestra of sine waves has a tendency to work wonders on the mind. Likewise, ""13 Moons"", though less propulsive than ""Rise"", seems at once distantly cosmic and conventionally pretty. Gonzalez and Russom are hardly inaccessible artists. ""Black Spring"" is probably the most familiar sounding track on the album for me, especially after years of hearing film scores rip off Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"". The flip side is that it's also very easy to recommend spacey newcomers dive into its near-13 minute sonic arc. The Days of Mars is in fact a great introduction to ""space music"" in general-- just don't blame me if I return for repeat plays less often than for, say, TD's Phaedra or Riley's Persian Surgery Dervishes. Still, in a landscape full of seen and unseen phenomena, where the unknown seems almost passé, Gonzalez and Russom make music for taking things in stride. By turns bleak and beautiful, this is music for a new, but vaguely familiar world.","DFA duo skips stones across the same cosmic lake as forefathers Tangerine Dream, Terry Riley, and Mike Oldfield.

Feels,Animal Collective,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a19d034d5c69bf277b/1:1/w_160/796750c2.jpg,2005-10-17 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/,Fat Cat,"With each new album it becomes clearer that Animal Collective will not stay still. You can see them on tour and get a preview of the album to come in their live show, but aside from that, it's difficult to tell which direction their music will go next. If you'd heard Spirit They're Gone or Danse Manatee you could possibly have predicted the more difficult and abstract direction of Here Comes the Indian but you wouldn't have guessed they'd make something like Campfire Songs around the same time; if you'd heard the latter you'd might hazard a guess about Sung Tongs but Feels wouldn't necessarily strike you as the work of the same band. That said, the newly released Feels is not a total departure from Sung Tongs, and it actually tracks it quite closely in terms of the album's structure. It's apparent from the first few bars of ""Did You See the Words"" that A.C. begins in ""song"" mode, setting aside for the moment the soundscaping that defined the earlier records. The first spin is a tad disconcerting because, with its electric guitar and more trad band set-up, Animal Collective sound for the first time like what they've always been to detractors with more outré tastes: an indie rock band. The songs proceed with a logic that has more to do with the early experiments of Mercury Rev than say, Sebadoh, but where Animal Collective previously sounded as if they were working according to an unusual set of rules, the first half of Feels exists in relationship to music history, and not just any music history, but rock. I hear the ghosts of 1950s artists like Buddy Holly inside more straightforward pop songs ""Grass"" and ""The Purple Bottle"". On ""Grass"", the reverb on Avey Tare's voice adds a hiccup to every syllable and the guitar is processed to sound at times like the rollicking boogie-woogie piano rhythm. Of course, 50 years ago no one would have made a chorus out of loud, clipped screams synchronized to bashed drums (well, maybe Jerry Lee Lewis), and the conversational vocal harmony breakdown of ""The Purple Bottle"" jumps ahead a decade to a highly psychedelicized Beach Boys. Such moments are why the adolescent unpredictability of Animal Collective is such an asset-- they're able to tap into the narrative of Western pop while making it their own. Like Animal Collective's previous full length, Feels is sequenced carefully, with jauntier, tuneful numbers leading to an amorphous back half. The two transitional songs in the record's middle, ""Bees"" and ""Banshee Beat"", are among the best things Animal Collective has done. ""Bees"" imagines how a drifting pop song might sound inside the sonic universe of an Alice Coltrane album, with a trebly autoharp that is all strings and no body and sustained clusters of piano that bring to mind an ascension through clouds. ""Banshee Beat"" is even better. Animal Collective's signature approach to composition-- in which open chords are strummed repeatedly for longer than seems necessary to create a unique sense of tension relieved only by vocal chants and howls-- finds its apotheosis over these eight minutes. ""Daffy Duck"" is a further exploration of the ideas presented on ""Bees"", and ""Loch Raven"" is an uncharacteristically tender electro-acoustic lullaby, vaguely Aphexian in the way it mixes sine wave drones with a simple piano line and a cluster of wordless voices. The upbeat ""Turn Into Something"" brings the album back to where it started. Feels is an excellent record, one that, despite a more conventional approach, happens to get better over time. But it's also interesting to contemplate as a chapter in the Animal Collective story. If the childhood pals can stay friends and continue to inspire each other we may have some more great records down the road. At the moment they seem on a pretty heady plateau, but you don't get the idea listening to Feels that they've said nearly all they have to say.

Ciautistico!,XXL,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad113d1975652139ad9/1:1/w_160/ed136b31.jpg,2005-10-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8828-ciautistico/,Important,"This loose, billowing collaboration between the American avant-pop band Xiu Xiu and Italian post-rockers Larsen has a familiar back story: It's the classic band-meets-band, band-pursues-band, band-gets-band narrative arc. Xiu Xiu and Larsen, each aware and vaguely admiring of the other, meet at a Jarboe show, exchange records, vow to stay in touch, and become so mutually enthralled that they actually follow through and record an album together. They meet up in Torino without much of a plan and immerse themselves in the studio with trad rock instruments plus a bunch of theremins and glockenspiels. They jam intensely around sketched-out song structures and sequence the most realized bits as an album, an ephemeral and fractured thing that mirrors its mode of creation. As listeners, we're rightfully wary of such one-off collaborations-- they often produce thrilling results in rap, where oversized personalities slam into one another explosively, but in indie rock, they can lead to a sort of hazy obscurantism as each musician tiptoes around the other's style. The results are often more interesting than realized, the sort of exploratory blurs that the In the Fishtank series often produces, which are easy to praise and then quickly forget about. And XXL may well wind up as such an artifact, prized by collectors but inessential for the causal fan. Nevertheless, it's surprisingly cohesive and focused for such a spontaneous production, largely because each band tempers the other's excesses. Xiu Xiu's confessional overstatement is as distinctly American as Larsen's cerebral reserve is European, and on Ciautistico!, they meet in the middle to create a music that scans as either a more rational Xiu Xiu, as on the structurally balanced instrumental tracks uninterrupted by dramatic shards of dissonance, or more emotional Larsen, as on the tracks where Stewart's aching vocals imbue the silvery drones with a messy human presence. As if striving to embody the impulses of both bands, Ciautistico! is both corporeal and weightless-- you feel the bodily plunk of each intoned string and chime, and the shimmering confusion of the resultant sound waves decaying and diffusing into one another. The tone is icy yet resonant, drops of water falling into a deep well. ""Paw Paw Paw Paw Paw Paw"" opens with a low three-note bass drone and watery synth washes, but instead of continuing down the path of abstraction, Larsen's insanely tight drummer and Stewart's timorous vocals bundle up the atmosphere into a gloomy pop song. This is immediately offset by the album's most daunting song, ""Minnie Mouseistic"", which plays like the sound effects for a radio drama-- discordant tones, gentle concussions, creaks and ratchets bloom in isolation on a field of silence. Certain moments are pure Xiu Xiu, like the svelte electro-throb of ""Ciao Ciautistico"" and the sparkling fountain of synths that closes ""Birthday Song"", but for the most part, Xiu Xiu and Larsen slip into a methodical mind-meld, shuffling melodies and countermelodies toward their logical conclusions.","This collaboration between Xiu Xiu and Italy's Larsen was pared down from lengthy jam sessions.

The Campfire Headphase,Boards of Canada,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33213d1975652138a30/1:1/w_160/aefaaee8.jpg,2005-10-16 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/839-the-campfire-headphase/,Warp,"The reclusiveness and mystery surrounding Boards of Canada has never been of much interest to me. When music possesses such an uncomplicated immediacy, the story of how it was made and by whom is less crucial. The macro of Boards of Canada's music is so well ordered, so complete, that the stories of the constituent parts are incidental. I never much cared for Easter eggs anyway; with art like this I prefer to let my subconscious do the work of sorting things out. So I find this band's records easy to take at face value. Geogaddi was three years ago, and since that time Boards re-issued Music Has the Right to Children as well as early records like Twosim. With that small flood of material on the market at the same time we were able to digest Boards' career output as a whole and it became clear how deeply committed they are to a core sound that was quite well formed from the get-go. As long as Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin are making music together they will always sound like Boards of Canada. Geogaddi was a few shades darker than what came before, but the grim hints of violence that record suggested are nowhere to be found on The Campfire Headphase. Instead, the latest record offers perhaps the dreamiest vision of the band yet. The first time through Campfire, I found myself wondering whether Stephen Wilkinson of Bibio had been offered a guest spot. Bibio got a small blip of buzz last year for Fi, his beguiling album of queasy four-track experiments with processed guitar. On the record he was promoted as a ""discovery"" of Boards, and, after listening to The Campfire Headphase, it's clear why they were so taken with his sound. Boards use of guitar on tracks like ""Chromakey Dreamcoat"" and ""Hey Saturday Sun"" makes explicit something about the band's sound that was always just beneath the surface: the connection of the music to the pastoral tradition of British folk. That feeling of nature's green as gold, the stream of sunlight through fluttering leaves, the communion with the environment that always involves a confrontation with death. There's a reason people bring weed with them on camping trips. Of course, this being Boards of Canada, the guitar is first a sound tool, the familiar timbre of which is loaded down with the weight of emotional memory. So it's bent, stretched, spun in with the thick swirl of sound (The Campfire Headphase is a anything but minimalist) to become another ingredient in the record's stew. It bugs me that most of the songs here with guitar use one very simple picked chord and basically bring the loop in and out in predictable fashion. Perhaps because of the instrument's familiarity it naturally draws attention to itself, and there's no getting around that there's not very much happening with the guitar on most of the tracks where it appears. It adds nice twist, sure, but nothing more. In terms of mood, Campfire is a sluggish record, weary, pointed edges dulled as if by the march of time. Boards could previously be counted on to offer a display of crisp, forceful drum programming to jar you out of your narcotic haze (""Telephasic Workshop"" and ""Gyroscope""). The Campfire Headphase is all midrange, the mid-tempo shuffles putting the mind-boggling array of instrumental processing front and center. In the sound generation department, at least, they're still hitting. The best thing Campfire Headphase has going is its unnamable synthesizer sounds. As copied as their aesthetic has been, it's amazing that after all this time they're still flat-out better at coming up with cool noises than just about everybody. The pure exercises in texture, like the minute-long between-track interludes like ""Ataronchronon"" and ""Constants Are Changing"" are among the record's high points. These blissed-out narcotic interludes don't come quite often enough, though, and in fact this feels like a step down from the last two albums. It would be very hard not to step down from the heights scaled by those records, but by subtly altering their approach and adding bits of guitar The Campfire Headphase never really seems to give it a go. The Campfire Headphase is a good album and it's almost, but not quite, a good Boards of Canada album.",,7.6,
Frost Giant,The Dead Science,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc2abf31b7dc7155b73/1:1/w_160/85a8dc6f.jpg,2005-10-16 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2625-frost-giant/,Absolutely Kosher,"Xiu Xiu have created a style that's recognizable enough to serve as a benchmark for similar bands that are less renowned or realized. The Dead Science is one such band, and if it's going too far to speculate that they're emulating Xiu Xiu, it's still useful to outline those familiar strokes, lay them over the Dead Science's ornate contours, and note where they diverge. The affinity's not imagined; Jamie Stewart declared the Dead Science's Sam Mickens one of his favorite guitarists on this very site, calling his playing ""both cool and violent."" It's an apt description of Mickens's atmospheric and elegantly discordant style, but it also fits Stewart's own. Their milieus are so closely aligned, it's safe to venture that if you're in the nay-saying camp vis-à-vis Xiu Xiu, you can stop reading this review right now: There's nothing for you here. The immediately striking resemblance is between Stewart's and Mickens's vocals. You wouldn't necessarily mistake one for the other; Stewart's voice is throatier and more delicate where Mickens' is thinner, with an almost flinty edge. But these are relatively minute distinctions; to the casual listener, the two will scan as analogous because of their highly affected, relentlessly melodramatic, and falsetto-heavy mien. More precisely, Mickens inhabits about half of Stewart's vocal range: Eschewing the harsh dynamic shifts that instantly catapult Stewart from a reedy mewl to a hoarse shout, Mickens hunkers down in his breathy falsetto, occasionally recalling Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren when he lets it drop into a sweetly menacing purr. This consistency paints the album monochromatically, but achieves powerful effects on the more ephemeral songs. On ""Sam Mickens' Dream"", he sings, ""I went to sleep/ Perchance to dream,"" his voice bending and quivering in a manner well-suited to the watery guitar strum that inches the song along. And on ""The Future, Forever (Until You Die)"", it seeps around the splintering chords and free-form percussion like tendrils of fog. The Dead-Science-as-half-of-Xiu-Xiu tack is easy to continue from the vocals to the music-- were you to strip the bombastic synth workouts from Xiu Xiu's records, the brittle and burnished guitars that remained would be of a piece with the ones on Frost Giant, here augmented by Jherek Bischoff's upright bass and Nick Tamburro's restrained percussion. On a record full of diverging paths, the most memorable moments occur when all three surge as one: On ""Drrrty Magneto"", Mickens's guitar lilts through an ominous two-chord figure, then cascading drum rolls and a climbing bass line propel the song toward a shivering pulse. To portray the Dead Science as half of Xiu Xiu doesn't imply that they're only half as good; it simply means they've limited their palette, by choice or by necessity, to a less diverse assortment of hues. Whether this is negative or positive depends on how (and if) you like your nauseous grandeur-- crashing emphatically over your head, or insinuating sneakily under your skin.","Jamie Stewart faves do their best to approximate Xiu Xiu's sound.

Porcella,The Deadly Snakes,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5113d197565213b072/1:1/w_160/3937cd1b.jpg,2005-10-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2520-porcella/,In the Red,"If bands could be pieced together at will, with wildly disparate influences snapping into place like lego bricks, every record would sound like a Deadly Snakes album. Expertly fusing classic rock, soul, blues, lo-fi, and punk into one throbbing machine, the Snakes mish-mash aesthetic inadvertently landed them in garage rock bins across the globe, rubbing stickers with the Hives and the Dirtbombs, shaking off the Standells and the Nuggets box, trying their best to reinvent the scrap-heap in a post-Beck universe. Porcella, the band's fourth full-length since their Toronto inception nearly a decade ago, is a funhouse, all warped mirrors and sliding floors, mellotron gurgles and trumpet hoots, too sinister to giggle away, too compelling to ignore. Much has already been made of the Deadly Snakes' self-proclaimed departure from their garage-rock roots-- but it turns out contemporary genre distinctions are actually just slippery (or meaningless) enough that the labels the Snakes are now so desperate to eschew (unlike the majority of garage revivalists, the Deadly Snakes are sophisticated songwriters and astute players) never really applied to them anyway. Consequently, Porcella is the next logical step in the Snakes' careful evolution-- dark, slinking, and packed with revelations. Porcella jerks from country-blues throwdowns with ""Jeeee-sus loves me!"" lyrics and typewriter drums (the semi-ridiculous ""Let It All Go"") to classic Snakes soul-tomfoolery (the freewheeling, honk-heavy ""Sissy Blues""), but never pauses for reflection or righteousness. Porcella may not be as explicitly ""garage"" as the band's previous records, but it still delivers the same beautiful, scrappy mess. Produced by vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Age of Danger (aka Max McCabe), Porcella sees Danger and Andre Ethier trading microphone duties, which provides interesting texture-- even if Ethier is the more interesting of the two. Mostly, Porcella is at its best when it's at its creepiest: ""High Prices Going Down"" opens with clanking metal (think chain gangs) and a loping bassline, before Ethier starts to wail: ""I read the news and I heard it said/ There's 200 already dead/ High prices going down/ And the king gave up his crown/ High prices are going down/ My mind was abuzz like a swarm of bees/ And I did just as I pleased."" Ethier's throaty, desperate howls bounce off smarmy mellotron, while the grim details of his looting grow more and more topical. ""High Prices"" is followed by single ""Gore Veil"", a wisp of a song that delivers despite itself, all goofy ba-da-ba-bas and trumpet exaltations. It's a strange juxtaposition, but that's what Porcella is all about: laying the laughable alongside the profound. The Deadly Snakes may be incessantly compared to the Kingsmen and the Kinks, but Porcella, like all of their records, packs a healthy dose of Dylan, too-- particularly the band's penchant for dark, awkward poetry and seizure-inducing blowouts, often showcased in the very same song.","In the Red band once again expertly fuses classic rock, soul, blues, lo-fi, and punk.

Talking Heads Brick,Talking Heads,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8855e6ef9596932121f/1:1/w_160/0f769258.jpg,2005-10-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8267-talking-heads-brick/,Rhino,"Every critical cliché and overused word you've seen applied to the Talking Heads discography over the years is inescapable for a reason. More than some sort of ill-defined genius or brilliance, what made this band so special is that they captured their era without sounding consigned to it. Listening to ""Once in a Lifetime"" roughly 25 years after it was laid to tape-- and countless other tracks on this all-inclusive eight-disc box set-- their music is perhaps more relevant now than ever. ""And you may ask yourself, 'How did I get here'?"" is a sort of omni-biographical prediction for every individual caught up in the information age. It considers our lives as consumers-- lives spent consuming information, commercial goods, and trivialities-- and holds a magnifying glass to the moments when you look around at all you've collected and wonder what for. Talking Heads had an uncanny ability to tie connecting threads between seemingly disjointed elements, both musically and lyrically, and what may come across in David Byrne's lyrics as simple quirkiness or detachment more often seems like an open-minded willingness to give voice to the ridiculous things that lie in the subconscious. Talking Heads' roots extended to college at the Rhode Island School of Design, but they were truly forged in the crucible of New York City's burgeoning punk scene. In a sense they were the polar opposite of the band they often opened for at CBGB, the Ramones. But, unapologetically egg-headed and eclectic, even funky, Talking Heads were more pop-art than punk, filling their music with head-spinning tempo changes, freaked-out vocals, and a healthy propensity for experimentation. To say they were unique is like saying Thomas Jefferson was pretty smart-- even bands that have since tried to sound like them can't. The band's importance is acknowledged basically everywhere-- they're even in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame now-- so it's puzzling that it's taken their discography so long to receive the lavish treatment it deserves, something made even somewhat ironic by the band's early embrace of technology. In fact, the CDs have always sounded vastly inferior to the original vinyl releases. Enter the reissue gurus at Rhino, who've painstakingly assembled the definitive collection of the entire Talking Heads studio output. The Brick is an elegant presentation of all eight studio albums together in an austere white box embossed with the titles of the songs it contains. Each album is presented in DualDisc format, with the record and bonus tracks on the CD side, and a 5.1 surround mix and video extras on the DVD side. In addition to live footage, the set also calls attention to the band's early mastery of the video format. Each of their music videos are included with their respective LPs, and each is in an artistic (if not technical) league that only a small fraction of videos produced during MTV's first decade achieved. The fact that they're enjoyable on a level beyond nostalgia is impressive enough, but ""Love for Sale"" in particular, while hardly counting among the band's best songs, must rank among the best videos I've ever seen. Making wickedly insightful and intuitive use of footage from commercials and consumer logos, the short culminates in the iconic transformation of the band into chocolate figurines. As for the albums themselves, the clean remastering has made a spectacular difference in sound quality, boosting the levels and fleshing out the depth and dynamic range of the recordings. The earliest albums benefit most-- 77 and More Songs About Buildings and Food sound better than ever, as punchy and nervy as the music they contain. Those two albums effectively mark the band's first phase, with Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth laying down thick, r&b-influenced; grooves while Jerry Harrison and David Byrne, always an under-rated guitarist, offered up tricky interplay and dense texture. Byrne was a riveting frontman from the start, and he gets away with vocal tics and singing way outside of his range here in a way few other performers have. His eccentricity is the focal point of the classic ""Psycho Killer"", but it's songs like ""Uh Oh, Love Comes to Town"", ""Thank You for Sending Me an Angel"", and the cover of Al Green's ""Take Me to the River"" that emphasize how much each member brought to the table individually. As an ensemble, they were beyond tight, and their ability to lock into a tense groove led them to transition away from the concise, bouncy weirdness of their first two records into darker and more abstract territory. They began the transformation on 1979's Fear of Music, a willfully difficult, paranoid album that moves Byrne's anxieties to center stage. Opener ""I Zimbra"" is something of a fake-out, hinting at the group's future experimentation with African polyrhythms and heavy groove, but its gibberish chant is actually fairly indicative of what follows. On ""Mind"", Byrne's voice blurs with bizarre trickling synth and fractured bass; ""Paper"" and ""Air"" express uncertainty about our corporeal existence; Byrne smears irony over the record's most danceable rhythm track, ""Life During Wartime""; and ""Heaven"" paints the afterlife as a place of mind-numbing repetition: ""When this kiss is over it will start again/ It will not be any different/ It will be exactly the same,"" he sings, sounding sober, almost resigned. The album closes with a nightmare twosome in ""Electric Guitar"" and ""Drugs"", lysergic new wave tunes that collapse under their own oppressive weight. The bleak intensity of Fear of Music crystallized on Remain in Light, the band's masterpiece. Brian Eno had produced the band since More Songs, but here, he pushed them to stretch out and let their songs breathe as much as possible. The lack of ego on the album is striking. The band members switch instruments and share the spotlight with backup musicians-- Frantz is augmented by all manner of hand percussion, while Byrne gets plenty of help on the mic from huge choruses, often playing call-and-response. The grooves of ""Cross-Eyed and Painless"" and ""The Great Curve"" are unstoppable, while opener ""The Heat Goes On (Born Under Punches)"" feels like a constant, burning descent into a cauldron of polyrhythms. ""All I want is to breathe,"" sings Byrne in multi-tracked harmony, but the song is claustrophobic and constricted, refusing to allow his escape. ""The Overload"" is almost too dark, completely blotting out whatever small trace of sunlight might occasionally poke through earlier in the record. The album is a triumph, but it was understandably draining: Their follow-up took three years to complete. Speaking in Tongues was worth the wait. Movement is in its fiber, but it's the details of the arrangements-- the buzzy synths that answer Byrne in the chorus of ""Making Flippy Floppy"", the clicking handclaps of ""Slippery People""-- that make the album's funk so deeply satisfying. The mood is noticeably lighter as the band deftly extricate themselves from the seriousness of their two previous albums. Where Byrne sounded trapped in a fragile body on Fear of Music, here he muses that ""We've got great big bodies/ We've got great big heads."" ""Burning Down the House"" sets howling keys against mechanically fingered guitarwork and massive percussion, while ""This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"" wrenches human sadness from its synthesizer melody. Elsewhere, ""Pull Up the Roots"" and ""Girlfriend Is Better"" find the band at their loosest. Unfortunately, Speaking in Tongues was the last Talking Heads album that felt completely natural. The band's final three albums are rarely discussed relative to what came before; they're not nearly as rewarding. Little Creatures sported the outstanding single ""And She Was"", but is otherwise a staid, composed effort. Where once there were once loose grooves, there was now noticeable stiffness, and the music feels beholden to pre-established concepts rather than allowed to form through free-associative interplay. The follow-up, True Stories, was mostly filler packed in around the crunchy synth-rock of ""Love for Sale"" and ""Wild Wild Life"". As an album, it has its moments (and yes, Radiohead took their name from one of its songs), but it largely fails, too tightly intertwined with the narrative of its cinematic counterpart. The band's final album, 1988's Naked, is a strange beast, essentially two completely different sets of songs playing against each other on the album's two halves. The band began the recording process by assembling a series of grooves in New York, then traveled to Paris for overdub sessions, bringing in local African musicians (and Johnny Marr) in a slight return to the technique that made Remain in Light so great. It works on ""Blind"", a song beholden almost completely to its bubbling groove and sharp horn arrangement as Byrne sings in an unusual rasp. ""(Nothing but) Flowers"" is ebullient highlife funk, essentially a wistful celebration of the end of civilization as Byrne offers lyrics like, ""This was a Pizza Hut/ Now it's all covered with daisies,"" over chattering guitars and ultra-fluid rhythms. The record's flip, however, is much darker, almost completely divorced from what precedes it-- ""The Facts of Life"" is especially cold, with a mechanical synth and lyrics like, ""We are programmed happy little children."" Still, Naked is, for me, the best and most interesting of the band's closing trio of albums, and if nothing else, it shows them attempting a fresher approach. The quartet wouldn't officially announce their break-up until 1991, but they went out on a higher note than they're often given credit for. The reissue appends the interesting soundtrack song ""Sax & Violins"", which actually works as a strong closer for the album. Generally speaking, though, the outtakes and leftovers from the band's earliest sessions are the best Rhino offers on these discs. 77 especially is augmented by a wealth of rare tracks. ""Sugar on My Tongue"" deserved to make the original tracklist, if not in this particular recorded form, and Arthur Russell shows up sawing up his cello on the interesting ""acoustic"" version of ""Psycho Killer"" (a number of electric instruments are present). Beyond the quality of the actual music, Rhino has done a superb job of getting the sound of these albums to where it should have been long ago, and the bonus material is well-chosen and enlightening, if not essential listening. Including the band's videos and live footage from the years before they made videos was a great idea, and despite its high price tag and some strange packaging decisions (the jewel cases have no printing on the spines, and the back covers are solid white, which means you have to remove the liner notes to find the tracklists), the box is worth it for anyone who wants everything in one place. But of course, what ultimately matters most is the music, and listening to each of these records delivers something the elaborate artwork and fetishist packaging can't: proof this band deserves every kind word ever said about it.","Rhino reissues the entire Talking Heads studio catalog as a collection of deluxe DualDisc CD/DVD packages.

Thinking of You,Freakwater,by: Stephen M.

The band has studiously stuck by the same sound for so many years that we already know how it's going to play before we even hear it. We know it's going to have that familiar honkytonk gravitas and hymnlike pacing, the same clever wordplay and powerful harmonies. These ingredients produced a classic of alt-country, 1995's Old Paint, which intensifies the here-we-go-again vibe that shadows their subsequent releases: showcasing Janet Beveridge Bean and Catherine Irwin's vocal chops, that album was so good it pickpocketed all their tricks and left them no way to surprise us. So Thinking of You, Freakwater's seventh album, would seem to throw a slight curveball: It features members of Califone as Irwin and Bean's backing band, along with stalwart bass player Dave Gay. But this album isn't the departure that collaboration might suggest; instead of taking them in noisier, experimental, or more modern directions-- toward, say, Bean's former band, Eleventh Day Dream-- Califone only helps Freakwater sound even more like themselves. Multi-instrumentalist Tim Rutili uses guitar, organ, and ukulele to add texture songs like ""Cricket Versus Ant"" and ""Jewel"", and Evelyn Weston's bowed saw adds a little mystery to ""Jack the Knife"", but the most prominent instrument remains pedal steel-- here courtesy of Jon Spiegel-- which accentuates the country melancholia on almost every song. For Freakwater, the accompaniment is and always has been secondary; this is primarily a vocal-oriented band, and Bean and Irwin do the high-lonesome-in-a-crowded-bar sound better than just about anyone around. The opener, ""Right Brothers"", resounds like a torch song sung by arsonists, igniting a simmering verse into a fiery and forceful chorus. ""Loserville"" is so gorgeously bitter that it's difficult to decide if it's an anthem or a lament, and ""Upside Down"" is a perspective-twisting stomp that settles somewhere between defiant and self-deprecating. ""Sap"" is all wordplay about being lost for words: ""I fell like a thing that falls,"" Irwin sings. ""And I crashed like a thing that crashes,"" Bean responds. Before the song ends, they turn these tongue-tied similes in on themselves: ""I broke like the kind of thing that just can't bend,"" they sing in unison, ""and it went on and on and on like a thing that just won't end."" Bean and Irwin favor an unhurried tempo that allows their voices to crescendo gradually and dramatically. This reliance slows some songs, stalls others. Califone enables them to quicken that pace, but not to move with any more agility, so the album's reach occasionally goes beyond the range of their harmonies. They inject some 60s spunk into ""So Strange"", but the song feels a little leaden despite its go-for-broke breakdown, and the closer ""Hi Ho Silver"" never quite reaches the heights it aims for. But the band's longevity is the result of perseverance and personality rather than innovation. Which is fine: theirs is a tradition-bound music, and Thinking of You just makes it sound like their tradition is no longer comprised of the typical prerock sources, but of every previous Freakwater album.","Veteran Thrill Jockey duo get help from current or former members of Califone and Eleventh Dream Day on their latest LP.

Gone Ain't Gone,Tim Fite,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bec15e6ef959693232c5/1:1/w_160/84ec6ba2.jpg,2005-10-13 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3350-gone-aint-gone/,Anti-,"Go into any used-CD store and you'll undoubtedly see tons of old disks by forgotten also-rans, has-beens, and never-wases who have long since returned to their day jobs. Even marked down to $2.99, these albums will likely never sell, destined to haunt the cut-out bins and sale racks for eternity. Tim Fite's second full-length album and his major-label debut, Gone Ain't Gone, liberally samples some of these dusty artifacts into his songs and sonic collages, making them virtually indistinguishable from the live instruments. Whether he is rescuing or exploiting these works is debatable, but building off this type of pop culture effluvia is an intriguing, if not especially innovative, idea, especially considering how mp3s may make even used-CD stores obsolete. Fite's a collagist like the Avalanches and the Go! Team, for whom samples are their primary instruments, but like Beck, he's anchored to American music traditions like blues, folk, country, punk, and hip-hop. ""I Hope Yer There"" kicks off Gone Ain't Gone with dark, trilling guitars that sound like dread-filled alarms, but Fite ruins the effect with his gummy down-home drawl and preacherly shout-outs, which add only bluster to his blues. He sounds like an avant-garde G. Love-- and going avant-garde is the only way G. Love could be worse. The remainder of Gone Ain't Gone, however, shows Fite to be a musical shapeshifter with an ambitiously broad repertoire of styles and sounds. He's at his best when he sticks to rock sources: ""No Good Here"" is jangly pop interrupted by blasts of loud guitar courtesy of some band called the Seymores, and ""A Little Bit"" bounces along on what sounds like a backmasked high-hat and waspbuzz guitar. Throughout the album, though, Fite mixes his collage pop with false-sounding country hickisms and low-rent hip-hop exercises, which try to make a virtue out of their amateurishness. The territory between these two seemingly disparate genres has been well traveled by many artists (like Kid Rock, Bubba Sparxx, and, more recently, Cowboy Troy), and Fite doesn't have a whole lot to add except his foundational approach to sampling. That technique creates some interesting juxtapositions, such as the horn outro that caps the C&W; class lament of ""Away from the Snakes"", but more often, it feeds a persona that seems disingenuous and grating, especially on the stuttering raps that derail ""I Hope Yer There"" and ""Forty-Five Remedies"". The pointless jokiness of ""Cop Show"" reveals Fite to be something of an ironist (apparently confirmed by his press photo, which looks like a bug-eyed portrait from a circa-1962 college yearbook), while the sound bites on ""Toasted Rye"" (unattributed) and ""I've Kept Singing"" (from Paul Robeson) suggest a) That the album's theme is race and music, and b) That Fite is out of his depth. The distance between him and his music-- a distance filled mostly with others' music-- opens up the possibility for malignant caricature, as if the hip-hop elements are often just one step away from blackface. It's probably unintentional-- despite its ramshackle aesthetic, the album has the worked-over precision of a true labor of love-- but that doesn't really diminish its ugly potential. In the end, maybe all of these musical elements were simply never meant to be squashed together on the same album with Fite's overplayed persona, which will likely doom Gone Ain't Gone to suffer the same obscurity as its inspirations. That's no great tragedy.","Pop culture effluvia and sonic collages that borrow elements of blues, folk, country, punk, and hip-hop.

The Hear After,J-Live,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b3c0084474cd0c268a/1:1/w_160/114bc3ee.jpg,2005-10-13 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4181-the-hear-after/,Penalty,"Whenever someone says a record is ""Grown Folks Music"" I want to reply, ""dementia is Grown Folks Thinkin', doesn't mean I want a part of either."" Normally, the GFM evangelist peacocks around fanning his feathers in either defense or exhibition, associating dissent with ignorance. His sermon is ""the essence, the movement."" Hip-hop is Hip-Hop. Deviation is desertion, or worse, collusion. The Fifth Column of the Four Elements. Calm yourself, padre. Like every other genre, hip-hop inevitably striated with age; its own Paul McCartneys, Luther Vandrosses, and John Teshes emerged. No, Will Smith is not the answer. There are many answers. Snoop is pioneering Gangstadult. The Roots are morphing into rap's U2, producing reliable, if not necessarily revolutionary, album after album (?uestlove being the charismatic spokesperson for the group and the cause). Kanye may become the Phil Spector of all this with this on- and off-record antics. LL is LL. And fine, Will Smith is John Tesh. A whole cadre of underground artists, who were born too late, caters to this audience, creating a hip-hop analogy to the 1990s teenage Deadheads. J-Live is part of and apart from the adult-contempo scene, employing its smoothed-out boom-bap and socially conscious themes, but replacing its vexing nostalgia with ornery gravitas. The weary, and thankfully non-preachy, tone of The Hear After probably has to do with J-Live's history. His legendary struggle to release his debut, The Best Part, made him a grizzled vet before most had even heard his record in full. Written and recorded during the height of the underground revolt against gunclapper rappers in the mid- to late-90s, by the time it was properly released in 2001, The Best Part was a memento, a token of lost opportunity. In the interim, J-Live worked as public school teacher in Brooklyn, and his rhymes reflect the patient yet vigilant attitude of every good instructor. He doesn't need to get worked up; just keep plugging away in the hopes that your message will reach just one child. Probably the album's best track, ""Brooklyn Public, Pt 1"" revisits the frustration of his teaching experience, but it also reflects the underground's increasingly futile efforts to convert the masses. Over a school-recital piano line, J-Live laments, ""Some of them really care about what's being learned and taught/ They fought through it when they got stuck/ Some are there until the bell rings/ Run through the day without thinking 'cause they really don't give a fuck."" It has become the teachers' code: save the ones you can, hope the other ones don't kill you. While The Hear After probably won't appeal to the Bapesta Massive, it doesn't really try to either. The pared-down Roots-y production and edutainment factor might appeal more to their parents. ""Listening"" is a business-trip phone conversation between J-Live and his wife, Kola Rock, set to a whirling bass that evokes the comfort of a long engagement. ""Whoever"" is a night out at the neighborhood salsa club with J-Live calling out the punks that are not listening. It's also one of the several tracks J-Live produced himself, as per usual. What lesson did he learn from his early travails? Use samples owned by your parent label, Ryko, in this case. There really is no tragedy in J-Live's story, though. He was never set to break the mainstream. He's a sidewalk professor, the music more a conveyor of his lessons than an attempt at street anthems. He executes his tutorials with confident aplomb, never currying favor with a demographic that won't look him in his damn eye. It may not sound particularly vigorous or relevant, but neither is your dad. You should call him. Or just keep acting out.","Grizzled veteran trades in pared-down, Roots-y production and weary lyrics.

No Rest for Ghosts,Minus Story,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c461c0084474cd0c3699/1:1/w_160/083d1d9f.jpg,2005-10-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5588-no-rest-for-ghosts/,Jagjaguwar,"Following this year's Heaven and Hell EP, the Minus Story continue to scale back their manic instrumentation (the band would call it their ""Wall of Crap""), here applying it to an unambiguously somber batch of songs. For those familiar with The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corps Dance!, that album's ""You Were on My Side"" is a good reference point for the sound of their new album No Rest For Ghosts. From the morose, existential lyrics to the goth cartoons in the liner notes and cross-stitched pink skull on the cover, No Rest for Ghosts aims for the cute side of the macabre. ""Little Wet Head"" describes being swallowed and regurgitated by an infant in disturbing detail (""You crawled, then you walked... you grew so huge that you blocked out the sun/ Then you go and you plant my head in your jaws""). That and ""Waking Up"" pick up the tempo at the center of the record, but love and loss loom heavy over the majority of the songs, particularly the slower tracks. The mood may be monochromatic, but the band is never short on ideas. Percussion is inventive and clear as a bell, such as the thundering electric drums of ""I Was Hit"" or woodblocks that trip over themselves and fall into a bed of handclaps on ""Knocking on Your Head."" At other times, the sound seems cluttered, like when the piano and higher guitar notes bleed together on ""Ringing in the Dark"". Moreover, the percussion of ""Knocking on Your Head"" is more memorable than the melody, as are the backing vocals on the ponderously sad ""Hold On"". The touches in instrumentation make this an interesting listen with, like a walk on a rainy afternoon with a head full of stimulants, every detail flowering and compounding each other. But for better or for worse, the more the band holds back, the more the songs on No Rest for Ghosts rely on the featherweight vocals of frontman Jordan Geiger. The spartan production is nothing new for the band, but the tamer they are, the more the lo-fi approach holds them back. Put the Minus Story in a room with Jon Brion or Dave Fridmann, they might come out with a masterpiece. For now, it sounds like someone let drama students loose in the band room.","Jagjaguwar band continues to scale back its manic instrumentation, here applying it to an unambiguously somber batch of songs.

Strange Geometry,The Clientele,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fac0084474cd0c0851/1:1/w_160/5d1cb216.jpg,2005-10-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1507-strange-geometry/,Merge,"When I was in high school a friend drove a 1970 Impala that his gearhead dad had kept garaged for years. The radio was AM-only, and as luck would have it, reception was poor and the only station it could pull was Lansing, Mich.'s version of the ""Golden Oldies"" format. Oldies, yes, these were the songs to hear in this car. Tooling through the streets while listening to pop singles from the late 1950s and early '60s through that factory-original system, the production of the era made perfect sense. Songs like the Flamingos' ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" or the Association's ""The Time it Is Today"", with all their lush reverb, opened up the single in-dash speaker and kept us in the middle of the music as if it was Dolby 5.1. Those producers knew exactly what they were doing. Reverb gives the illusion of immersion, and immersion is what the Clientele is all about. Singer and guitarist Alasdair Maclean writes songs that work like songs are supposed to, but I've no desire to hear them covered by another artist. Clientele songs are bound tightly to the performance and production; to separate them would destroy the effect. Still, the band's signature sonic trick-- laying a thick coating of reverb Maclean's voice in tribute to the AM radio production of the '60s-- has in a sense been isolating; such a relentless stylization is bound to turn away some people. There's a subtle shift in that regard here on Strange Geometry, the Clientele's second full-length. The reverb is toned down considerably, strings have been added (courtesy of Louis Philippe), and the album as a whole is more direct and focused. This clarity foregrounds Maclean's songwriting talent, a poetic ear tuned into a more surreal world, with darker images bumping against the bucolic scenes of records past. The music retains its easy tunefulness, but inside many of the songs lurks a desperation that seems new to the Clientele world. ""Crowds pulled you away, through the ribbons and the rain, and the ivy coiled around my hands"" in ""(I Can't Seem To) Make You Mine"". And then on the catchy mid-tempo ""E.M.P.T.Y."", Maclean sings, ""Driving west, now half past five/ My skin is cut, my hands are knives."" On previous Clientele records loneliness and romantic longing led to a hyper-aware state of quiet contemplation; here there's a vague suggestion of underlying violence. ""The crowd"" is mentioned throughout Strange Geometry but the narrator never seems part of it. Instead he wanders the streets seeing things--lifeless bodies in doorways, his own face inside trees-- that may or may not be there. Passages of blissed-out musical haiku like Suburban Light's ""6 am Morningside"" or The Violet Hour's ""Haunted Melody"" are nowhere to be found. It's not right to play up the differences too much, though; this is in most respects a classically ""Clientele"" record. The primary differences can be found by comparing the version of ""Impossible"" from last year's Ariadne EP with the one released here. On the former, Maclean's voice sounds like it's been bounced off the ionosphere an ocean away, and the band's instruments sound pinched and aged. The Strange Geometry version begins with a stately string arrangement as a lead-in to a much meatier sound, while sticking with the same basic arrangement. The slight nods to accessibility and the decreased stylization might disappoint some of the faithful at first, but Strange Geometry grows more appealing with repeated listening. On the whole, Strange Geometry does a better job than The Violet Hour translating the Clientele's aesthetic, which lends itself easily to the single or EP, to the demands of a full-length record. One of today's most consistently wonderful bands has kept up its long winning streak. ","When I was in high school a friend drove a 1970 Impala that his gearhead dad had kept garaged for ...

Goo [Deluxe Edition],Sonic Youth,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c4ea9e61561daa4fb3/1:1/w_160/802bfdf8.jpg,2005-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7349-goo-deluxe-edition/,GeffenGeffen,"Never let it be said that Byron Coley (storied zinester cum storied music critic, and renowned Friend of Thurston) isn't above street-teaming when the occasion calls for it. That there's also a brief essay/anecdote by Sonic Youth's A&R; guy inside this Deluxe Edition package of Goo doesn't keep Coley from doing his civic duty, heaping praise upon this album's shoulders via wonky descriptors like ""Mountain-on-Ketamine"" or ""a puzzle ballad about the road to oblivion."" However, amidst all the polysyllabic polish, Coley offers a bit of truth: ""[S]ome long-time fans were already croaking that the band was moving in a rockist direction, leaving behind the avant-noise roots that had marked their early history. Of course this was a load of happy horseshit. Sonic Youth had been rocking the fuck out from the git-go; they were just doing it in a language that most people didn't understand."" Indeed, if 1991 was the year punk broke, then 1990-- the year Sonic Youth supposedly bit the wax tadpole-- was when punk decided to step off the ledge. No doubt there were folks at the base of the wall, trying to cushion the impact. And, of course, they all ended up with egg on their face, and Goo in their lap. Fifteen years later, things have and haven't changed -- hair bands abound, but instead of Aquanet and spandex, they accessorize with chain wallets and MySpace accounts. And while Sonic Youth will never be ready for their close-up, there's stuff getting play on the radio stations that doesn't sound all too different from the more accessible moments offered on this here album. An album which, of course, doesn't sound all too different from the stuff SY was offering the kids prior to cashing Geffen checks, aside from those oh-so-important production values. Byron says howdy. Thanks to the wonders of remastering, the gaudy glory of Goo is brought to the forefront. Thurston and Lee making like Lou and Sterling on ""Tunic"", the seven-second radio-dial montage leading into ""Mote"", the bombastic hissyfit at the end of ""Mildred Pierce""-- all new-to-you, brought to you now in hi-def quadrophonic Technicolor! And thanks to this being the Deluxe Edition, you can compare and contrast the bright and shiny Goo against the storied and mythic Goo demos, which sound like, um, demos. You might prefer the ramshackle charm of ""Animals"" over the hit-it-and-quit-it tightness of the finished product (""Mary-Christ""), but you have both here, so there's no need to really choose. My ears prefer the Hollywood 70mm treatment over the handheld shaky cam cuts, but there's something to be said for the three-minute fuck-you danging at the end of ""Blowjob"" (aka ""Mildred Pierce""). Also, the instrumental version of non-album cut ""Lee #2""-- a gentler, twangier Sonic Youth-- has it all over the previously unreleased version that makes the mistake of adding words. As for the non-demo bonuses, they're there. The kick to be had listening to Thurston and Kim talk beat over snippets of Goo (as part of some flexidisc promo)-- woot to the Watt shoutout, T-- but there's a good reason it's at the end of the second disc. Elsewhere, the Youth cause a ruckus, cover the Boys Beach and Neon (with Lee, of course, playing the part of Brian Wilson in the former), and there's a bit of that catchy rockist stuff that some of the fans probably still can't stand. ""Can Song"" is three minutes of dirty booting that's hard to resist. That Thurston felt the need to preface the track-- now called ""The Bedroom"", previously released as a concert-recorded B-side-- with a question about your mom being a skinhead is something best left between him and his therapist. Old transgressive habits die hard, I guess, just like punk supposedly did, way back when Sonic Youth deigned to pitch and shift their rock and roll to a decidedly bigger demographic and fuck it up for everyone. And fuck it up they did, thank God.","Two-disc deluxe version of the legendary indie band's Geffen debut adds outtakes, B-sides, rehearsals, and demos.

Return the Gift,Gang of Four,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee8c0084474cd0c2f64/1:1/w_160/c4b91679.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3390-return-the-gift/,V2,"The first time I heard Gang of Four I had no idea who they were or why they were important. I was in high school, and I plucked Mall from a 99-cent bin because it was cheap and I wanted to hear something new. That's right, Mall. It was the worst possible intro to the band, the still-born result of Andy Gill and Jon King's first reunion under the name. I slogged through ""Cadillac"" and ""F.M.U.S.A."" a few times, shelved it, and forgot about the Gang of Four until I began to hear rumblings about their brilliance a couple of years later. Since Mall belly-flopped into the cut-out racks in 1991 there have been two more revivals of the Gang of Four name. The first brought Gill & King together in 1995 for the passable Shrinkwrapped album; the most recent (and ongoing) reunion brought back the much-vaunted original lineup in full. Hugo Burnham and Dave Allen get less credit, but they were every bit as important to the band's airtight, brittle funk-punk as their mates, and having them back has turned the reunited band into a genuine powerhouse. Of course, it helps to have some good songs to play, and it's an understatement to say that the tracks from Entertainment! and Solid Gold have held up damn well over the decades. The rest of their catalog, recorded with varying line-ups, hasn't been so lucky, but they wisely steer clear of most of it in the set-lists of their marathon tours. These reunion things can be dodgy propositions, but Gang of Four's live attack is as savage as ever, even without new songs to change things up. New songs from old acts tend to disappointing anyway-- just look at ""Bam Thwok"" or, more to the point, anything Gill and King did in the absence of Burnham and Allen. So the show is great, a slightly ironic nostalgia trip down Agit-pop Memory Lane and a chance for the original item to show all the worshipful kiddies who've taken their sound and run off with it how it's really done. So the next logical step following the accolades is to release a live album documenting every ass-kicking highlight of the show, right? Well, not exactly. Gang of Four have instead hit the studio to capture the spirit of their live show, in the way they feel the old albums never did. It's the band's right to feel they're upgrading their old work to some standard they think it fell short of (Burnham apparently hated the drum sound on the original records), but last I checked, almost no one else was talking about room for improvement where ""To Hell With Poverty"" and ""Damaged Goods"" were concerned. And as far as the material from the records made with the original line-up goes, there is no improvement. It sounds good, of course, simultaneously heavier and less abrasive than the old tracks, and certainly not worse, but it does feel a little pointless to take in these new studio versions when I've got the old ones sitting right there on a shelf. They revive two songs from their third album Songs of the Free, made after baked-goods mogul Sara Lee took over from Allen on the bass, and have vastly improved both of them. ""I Love a Man in Uniform"" and ""We Live As We Dream, Alone,"" were both fantastic songs trapped in lead-assed funk bodies and hideous over-production; here they strip away the hired backing vocalists, kick up the tempos, and attack the songs with the righteous fury they deserve. And speaking of righteous fury, it's time to hit that touchy Marxism/Capitalism subject, because there are reasons beyond the drum sound that the band chose to make this record. If you're among the naive and idealistic crowd who believe Gang of Four to be unassailable ideologues, champions of the proles, guys who'd never in a million years do anything just to make a buck, feel free to put your fingers in your ears and yell ""la la la"" for the rest of the paragraph. It began back in 1979, when the band signed a poor contract with EMI (a move that earned them the rather self-important scorn of erstwhile kindred spirits like Crass and the Ex). To date, Gang of Four still have unrecouped advances on their EMI catalog and have never seen a dime of royalty cash from sales. So in order to pre-empt an attempt by their old label to cash in on the reunion with a best-of compilation they'd see no money from, they made their own best-of album, recording new masters that they'll be able to earn royalties from. It's good business. There's also a ""bonus"" disc of remixes that in all honesty ought to have been limited to an edition of zero. It's not all a horror show-- Ladytron and the Rakes both do nifty things with ""Natural's Not in it"" (the source tapes are the new recordings) and Karen O gets to live the dream on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs remix of ""I Love a Man in Uniform"", taking the chorus herself while her bandmates recontextualize the song's beat as straight disco. The rest? Let's just say that Hot Hot Heat's remix of ""Damaged Goods"" is the worst track I've heard all year, clipping the vocals and placing them awkwardly around a criminally naff beat. King's chopped voice sounds like it's begging for release from the fifth level of Hell. At least Go Home Productions had the good sense to realize that there's no way to improve on the bass and drum groove of ""To Hell With Poverty"" and just got rid of it entirely instead of trying to tweak it. Amusement Parks on Fire come close to making a decent dubside for ""Why Theory?"" but ruin it with laser noises and gratuitous programming that feels placed in out of an obligation to fill sonic space. And that's ultimately what the whole release winds up doing, filling space. Whether or not Gang of Four write any new songs during this latest stint together is moot-- their legacy is already sealed. The old songs still sound great, while the new drum sound and wetter, louder production just sound modern; in an odd way it's already more dated than the sound of the original albums. Bottom line is that if you've got the old albums and you want to experience Gang of Four again, better to shell out for the actual show than for the disc that approximates it. Good on the band for getting in touch with their inner capitalists, but Return the Gift is ultimately superfluous.","The first time I heard Gang of Four I had no idea who they were or why they were important ...

With Love and Squalor,We Are Scientists,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab7b1335d7bf1699701/1:1/w_160/5bbe526a.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8805-with-love-and-squalor/,Virgin,"With Love and Squalor is the debut LP from We Are Scientists, and while they've been self-releasing material since 2000, the album shows the exuberance of youth on every seam: lyrics about girls and drinking and little else, rhythms rushed just past danceability, guitar-heavy verses with even heavier guitars in the chorus, more hooks, more riffs, more syllables than needed in the word ""explode""-- about 11 instead of two-- on opener ""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"". Singer Keith Murray is the ringer of this scrappy crew. His calm, romantic delivery takes these constantly shifting tracks, with guitars filling every corner of the compositions, and makes them a little more palatable. For a band that's going to incur some Hot Hot Heat references for their spastic but accessible take on indie rock, his professional croon is a pleasant counterpoint to Steve Bays' yelp. The band attempts to deliver a perfect single on every track, and expectedly, only a few deliver that rush. While ""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"" comes on a little too strong, the following ""This Scene Is Dead"" and ""Inaction"" quickly find their groove. ""This Scene Is Dead"" plays like a cuddlier version of Les Savy Fav's ""The Sweat Descends"", a few notes of guitar reverberating over the verses before a churning chorus, and ""Inaction"" loses no momentum through its rhythmic twists and turns. The band does their best to change the beat and keep it fresh between the three of them (bass, guitar, and drums) while straddling the line between indie and pop-punk. But somewhere around ""Cash Cow"", a pattern starts to emerge: a herky-jerk indie-safe verse meets with soaring stretched vowels and downstrokes on the chorus. It's an effective formula, provided it isn't used on 12 consecutive tracks. There are a few songs that transcend the cut-and-paste approach, like the punk-inflected ""Callbacks"", Murray's Devo-like inflection on the giddy repetition of ""The Great Escape"", and the slower ""Can't Lose"". On ""Can't Lose"", the rhythm section stutters like an engine with one piston, and while the chorus pulls the same trick as all the others, the band comes up with a brief bridge that's so unassuming and tender it contrasts with the entire album. Most of these tracks have hooks aimed straight for your jugular, but ""Can't Lose"" shows the band could go even farther with a little restraint.","Spastic, accessible indie rock from scrappy Hot Hot Heat soundalikes.

The Land We All Believe In,Cerberus Shoal,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a578b1335d7bf1698be2/1:1/w_160/bb2ec357.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1387-the-land-we-all-believe-in/,North East Indie,"These are fertile times for political absurdists, a fact that's clearly not been lost on the wayfarers of Cerberus Shoal. Without much fanfare, the Portland, Maine-based group has constructed a broad and unwieldy discography that is resistant to blanket judgements. But for their 11th release, the avant-garde troupe have issued what is surely their most topical, lyrically-focused collection, and the The Land We All Believe In emerges as a magnanimous, comic investigation into realities both political and otherwise. Along the route Cerberus Shoal maintain their catholic approach to instrumentation and deformed pop structures, resulting in their loopiest piece of sonic theater to date. Over the course of their now decade-plus career, Cerberus Shoal's sound has undergone a higher-than-average number of directional shifts, due primarily to their ever-revolving membership. Since 2003's Chaiming the Knoblessone, however, the roster has relatively stabilized into a regular septet that now also includes percussionist Tim Morin. Produced by Scott Colburn, longtime cohort of the Sun City Girls and John Fahey's Revenent label, the music on The Land We All Believe In continues to function without an absolute center. In true ensemble form everyone takes turns sharing vocal duties and assuming the spotlight, and never before has the group sounded further afield from their indie-punk origins. Here in fact there are long stretches where they instead explore various pre-rock forms, roaming freely through gnarled ethnic folk, woozy sea chanteys, and trilling showtunes in a manner reminiscent of a looser, more rustic Thinking Fellers Union Local #282. ""Reality, you are not quite what you used to be,"" sing Colleen Kinsella and Erin Davidson over banjo and clattering percussion on the elegiac opening title track, a sentiment that the group then proceed to repeatedly confirm over the course of the next hour. Founding member Chriss Sutherland pilots the manic ""Wyrm"" over choppy waters, vocalizing in his own distinct, impenetrable dialect; while ""Pie for the President"" prescribes a unique form of activism (""Bring a pie to ze president/ I want to feed him big sausages"") and ""Junior"" perhaps takes further oblique swipes at our Commander in Chief, ""Junior, I've got something to tell you/ All that you fear is shit."" Things come increasingly unhinged on the epic-length ""The Ghosts Are Greedy"", which contains an extended mid-song spoken word segment railing against the government, media coverage, and the mysterious ""Dr. Draino"". Eventually this track opens into a reassuring coda that optimistically proclaims, ""There is no conflict...We belong united,"" noble sentiments that would likely be more persuasive were the group's vocals not so progressively melodramatic and Muppet-like. And as the album closes with the jazzily skewed ""Taking Out the Enemy"", one is left with the impression that perhaps Cerberus Shoal make their best arguments in favor of a tolerant, egoless unity at those times when they all keep their mouths shut and let their playfully audacious music do their talking.","Avant-garde troupe issues its most topical, lyrically-focused collection to date.

Suckfish,Audion,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ce5e6ef9596932028f/1:1/w_160/27360a52.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/488-suckfish/,Spectral Sound,"It's hard to get out of Suckfish once it's on. You're just suddenly in it, like a silver pinball shot into the screwy Op art lock groove of its cover. The prickly microhouse rhythms he brought to 2003's Leave Luck to Heaven are still present, but as Audion Matthew Dear tops those stipples with synthesizers that growl and an attitude that says, ""Come on."" With this record, the only thing you're supposed to do is get off. Oscillating tones pierce the beat repeatedly on opener ""Vegetables"", and pretty soon there are manipulated voices in there too, mumbling alone in your mind. But that's just a preamble to the Suckfish thump of ""Your Place or Mine"" and ""Titty Fuck"". There are elements of empty space in the former-- Dear snips off the bass except for right over the drum so the synths are like pointy elbows jutting into the open space on a dancefloor, and the effect is chilly. But if their titles didn't give it away these songs are pretty randy, too-- Suckfish is techno that tumbles towards ecstasy in 4/4 time. ""Your Place or Mine"" is cool, but it's ""Titty Fuck"" that's the real base desire provider, its slinky 22nd century disco beat flirting with a five-note melodic tickler until the whole thing swells to a hissing, gritty finale that's just unclean. Back alley sex = bad idea. But that's the feel Dear is going for with Audion, however detached and dirty it is. He wants you to envision having relations among machines, or maybe machines having relations; either way, he provides tracks like ""Kisses"" and ""The Pong"" to do it to. ""Pong""'s primary tone thrusts and eases back, the inevitable give and take of a frantically dancing crowd in a dark basement room, and a howling bass line alternates with blasts of clattering rhythm and quieter moments that sound like pinging sonar. The calculated quality of Suckfish is part of its allure. Unlike Nympho, Armand Van Helden's recent foray into sexified disco-punk obviousness, Dear has specifically categorized ""Titty Fuck,"" the fluid, tense ""Uvular"", and the rest as being separate from himself. (You won't see something like the blatant ""Just Fucking"" on Leave Luck to Heaven's follow-up.) Releasing them under an alias allows Dear to position this material as a separate project, a grand design to get you laid. And the designer? Audion, which doesn't sound the least bit human and instead suggests a faceless superintelligent robot or hard plastic nub that will exude soothing ""penetration sounds"" in some Huxley sex parlor of the future. This is opposite to Van Helden's all too manmade and selfish approach, like bad cologne and worse drugs versus the sleek lines of Suckfish, the sex toy prototype.","Techno that tumbles towards ecstasy, courtesy of Matthew Dear.

Stadsvandringar,Dungen,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8dea9e61561daa727f/1:1/w_160/02cda70c.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2576-stadsvandringar/,ASKASK,"The third album should have been the payoff. As our introduction to Dungen, Ta Det Lugnt was like dessert before the appetizer-- it felt like cheating. Its retrofit so accurate and uncontrived, its swagger so fully detailed, the album came almost too effortlessly. Where was the artistic struggle? Who was this bodacious stoner with amazing hair, dusting off instant classics over husmanskost? There was backstory alright-- one needed only decipher Swedish to begin to look for it. But even a cursory familiarity with Dungen, the ungainly psilocybic debut, and the recently reissued Stadsvandringar, the more composed sophomore effort, reveals an unexpected twist: cheese is where wonder boy's heart really lies. If Ta Det Lugnt emerged untainted from a 30-plus-year cryogenic sleep, Stadsvandringar is the schizophrenic nightmare. Beatles and Tulls live a diatonic turn apart, crossbreeding most openly on ""Solen Stiger Upp"", whose prominent flutes disorient by dint of overhybridization, unsure whether to trill or thrill. ""Fest"" further sows confusion, tiptoeing a creaky ""Blackbird"" back porch before blowing the shit asunder. The faux-heavy outro loses a photo-finish to ""Sol & Regn"", which harmonizes woodsy fiddle and sunburnt guitar, in the race to sully Gustav Ejstes' integrity. So timeless psych-rock opus wasn't always the M.O.-- fear not, Scandinavians aren't born with Creation's catalog grafted to memory. Before realizing TDL, Ejstes made some hardcore realizations: ""I questioned everything about music,"" he told Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy. ""What's music? What's the meaning of it? I play G Minor and it's 'yeah yeah, I love you.' I was sick of it."" Oh, duh, intense self-reflection-- that's how you make compelling art. While Stadsvandringar marks a quantum leap forward from the noodly debut, the album pulls up at that gaping, pre-revelation void. Nothing on the disc touches TDL's bittersweet brilliance; riff-to-riff combat is a laugher. Where the latter mussed its pulchritude with conflict and cynicism, these diaper dandies are pleasure without the price. ""Stockholm"" is typical DOON-yun molasses sway, all top-heavy acoustic strum and underlying synth peals, but damned be that textbook half-cadence resolution. Spare us the theory lesson, tack. Non-speakers are at a disadvantage here: Without lyrics, we're ill-equipped to give Stadsvandringar-- or any of Ejstes' output-- a full rendering. In lieu of this important knowledge, then, join me in a listener participation exercise: Imagine Ejstes spitting your soupiest live journal stanza over ""Natten Blir Dag""'s vanilla verses. Now over ""Festival"". On which do the vox put their best sore thumb foreward? And on which do you not give a flying fuck what's being said? All this isn't to say Stadsvandringar is a poorly made album; in fact, by 2001 Ejstes had helmed a lot of the techniques-- frenetic jazz-rock drumming, fluid electro-acoustic interplay, whooshing abysses of reverb-- key to TDL's sound. But one can see how it could've made a man ill, making such sap as ""Natten Blir Dag"" when there's clearly the desire to branch out. Dungen made sense-- what tyro doesn't want to write 18-minute epics? But the shaky transition to pop form is fascinating because it renders Ta Det Lugnt even more improbable-- it was a breakthrough of heroic proportions, the stuff  >weepy biopics are made of.","Astralwerks reissue of the Swedish psych-rockers 2002 album.

Hell's Winter,Cage,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a746b1335d7bf1698fff/1:1/w_160/8bf26682.jpg,2005-10-12 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1820-hells-winter/,Definitive Jux,"Cage has the kind of life story most aspiring new-schoolers just lie and make up. He was abused by his dishonorably-discharged junky father and his stepfather, kicked out of high school, overmedicated in a mental hospital, became a white-rap wunderkind in the early 90s, almost put out an album on Columbia, kicked around the major label system, got hooked on drugs, had a kid, got dissed on the first Eminem album, and found himself a home in underground rap. It's much more interesting than the stab stab stab, kill kill kill, drugs drugs drugs shit he's been rapping about for years. Hell's Winter, then, is both a revelation and a forehead-slappingly obvious artistic move: The dude finally started drawing on his own experiences. Hell's Winter is a harrowing ride on which Cage describes his childhood in fractured blips of vivid images instead of broad, sweeping statements. On ""Too Heavy for Cherubs"", he matter-of-factly, almost gleefully, describes being forced to help his father shoot up: ""Erratic then gone, I went from manic to calm/ Watching the yellow liquid drip back out of his arm."" On ""Peeranoia"", he recalls his own drug addiction with a boastful, entertained lightness: ""Didn't quit PCP, it quit me/ Reality rolled me up, took two puffs, then clipped me."" But the album's mission comes into sharpest focus on ""Stripes"", where Cage's anger toward his father comes through without sarcasm or emotional distance. Elsewhere, Cage applies this bleak disgust to subjects outside his past; ""Grand Ol' Party Crash"" has an obnoxiously bananas George W. Bush impression by Jello Biafra, but Cage also describes a soldier dying in the hospital: ""He gets word that his unit didn't make it/ Got a free ticket home, but flatlined before he got to take it."" Of course, Cage also remains a demonic shock-rapper, and that side of him is fully on display here. He still bashes his old label boss, still fantasizes about murderous rampages, and unfortunately still says stuff like, ""There's a thin line between love and a fuck/ And how drunk she gotta be to put it in her butt."" But part of what makes Hell's Winter work is that Cage still sounds hungry and savage and wild-eyed; it wouldn't be anywhere near as charged or scalding if he'd turned into Atmosphere overnight. Even without the lyrics, Hell's Winter is the fullest realization of the Def Jux aesthetic since Mr. Lif's I Phantom. Much of the production comes from El-P, Central Services, and Blockhead, and all three rub heavy falling-down-stairs drums and glitchworks against gorgeously spacey blankets of synth. DJ Shadow's track for ""Grand Ol' Party Crash"" is an amelodic fuzzed-out stomper, while Camu gives the fiery posse cut ""Left It to Us"" a metal-fried guitar lope. Best of all, Rjd2's track for ""Shoot Frank"" is a tragically beautiful showstopper: dying house pianos over moaning female vocals and rolling martial drums, with a stunningly sad and resigned hook crooned by (of all people) Glassjaw's Darryl Palumbo. Like the rest of Hell's Winter, it shows what happens when the smartest people in indie rap decide to stop farting around and make something that resonates. ","With production from El-P, among others, and the emcee drawing from his own experiences in his music, this is the fullest realization of the Def Jux aesthetic since Mr. Lif's I Phantom.

The Mouse and the Mask,Danger Doom,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc1eb335119a49ecaed/1:1/w_160/e936f773.jpg,2005-10-11 06:01:40,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2624-the-mouse-and-the-mask/,Epitaph,"When news first surfaced of this collaboration between forum-favorite emcee MF Doom and copyright-infringing producer Danger Mouse, keyboards were atwitter with conjecture of what the duo would produce. Cartoon themes were a given-- maybe even too obvious-- but no one thought MF and DM would bring in Meatwad, the mucus-throated glob of raw beef who spits more heat than a thousand Biggie Smallses. If you think I'm describing a fat rapper and not an actual wad of meat, I feel for you, but don't leave yet. If you listen to Doom, you expect the ludicrous, and The Mouse and the Mask is his most ludicrous to date. Possibly in reaction to the rampant comedy skits on rap records in the last decade, Doom and Danger go all out, calling in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force to help craft the best funhouse hip-hop since De La Soul Is Dead. It may not move the critical masses like Madvillainy, but if nothing else, Danger Doom will get Comic-Con going nuts. By now, most fans know what to expect from the parties involved. MF Doom still wears his villainous mask and rhymes stuff with ""goonie-goo-goo"" and ""poop,"" along with brilliantly enigmatic self-deprecations and disses so cryptic their targets are oblivious. Danger Mouse, as he's done with cartoon hooligans and mashing up G.O.A.T.s, displays a deft hand on the sequencer and a taste for whimsical soundtrack samples. Here he takes that penchant and amplifies it, conducting neck-snapping scores for long-lost Looney Tunes. And then there's Adult Swim, the four-hour block of absurdimation aired late-nightly on the Cartoon Network, which slants toward bizarro and has a tendency for extreme sarcasm. Forcing all this farce onto one record could be disastrous, but instead it comes off like one big calamitous Saturday-morning public access show. Doom loves themes, as he's shown on Mmm... Food and his King Geedorah project, but never has the concept of an album had him sounding quite this chipper. The Adult Swim crew controls the vibe with ridiculous interludes (most notably, Master Shake contributes a series of escalatingly angry phone messages), but also inspires Doom to avoid the dourness that shades most of his other records. The labyrinthine self-analyses of Madvillainy are mostly absent, but Doom remains sharp, focused on slaying a cavalcade of smartass cartoons. Elsewhere, Cee-Lo stops by to croon over the fuzz and slap of ""Bizzy Box""; Talib Kweli lightens up and raps simply about breakfast cereal; and Ghostface recollects his own days behind the disguise on ""The Mask"", which certainly builds anticipation for a rumored GhostDoom project. Danger Doom won't change your life. It's not as revealing as Doom's other work, and Danger Mouse's big, Technicolor productions here are a little too trivial to be immortal. But for what it attempts-- which is basically a comedy record with no-joke skills-- it exceeds expectations. The intelligence of everyone involved keeps it from being Jeff Foxworthy-worthy, with the interludes and adlibs as rewindable as Doom's lyrics. Yes, I've heard Three 6 Mafia and Young Jeezy and Lil' Wayne, and the underground is keeping it so real.

The Psychic Nature of Being,Lichens,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdebabf31b7dc7156062/1:1/w_160/6924bbdc.jpg,2005-10-11 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4991-the-psychic-nature-of-being/,Kranky,"Engaging though it has been, there isn't much in Robert Lowe's previous discography that directly anticipates Lichens, his new solo project. As singer and bassist for 90 Day Men, and as new member of TV on the Radio, Lowe has been involved in his share of nervy, tough-to-pigeonhole art-rock. On The Psychic Nature of Being, however, he leaves behind all graspable traces of rock, opting instead to detail a deeply contemplative sequence of fingerpicked guitars and enigmatic veiled drones. And though this ambient, experimental approach has long been heavily trafficked-- particularly by those on the Kranky roster-- Lowe's understated playing and deceptive melodic skills enable him to here succeed in claiming a relatively untouched acre. The three lengthy pieces on The Psychic Nature of Being were recorded as real-time compositions without overdubs or edits. This curious, needlessly constrictive recording technique does make the album's deliberate, measured structure more impressive though not necessarily more entertaining. Throughout these tracks, Lowe uses wordless vocal loops as a mesmeric foundation over which he positions his tasteful acoustic fingerpicking and assorted effects, in a manner rather reminiscent of latter-period John Fahey albums like the Jim O'Rourke-produced Womblife. But Lowe's playing here is not as resolutely blues-based as Fahey's, and his meditative compositions ultimately dock somewhere between Six Organs of Admittance's most diffuse works and the slowed-gravity drones of Kranky labelmates like Stars of the Lid. Both of the album's first two tracks open with long unaccompanied stretches of Lichens' unique vocal effects, whose hushed, recurrent loops can sound almost medieval in their outspread minimalism. On ""Kirlian Auras"" these time-stretched drones prove so captivating that it comes as something of a jolt when the guitar finally enters a few minutes into the piece. As a guitarist, Lowe plays with a graceful melodic economy, allowing his instrument to effortlessly join into the ongoing ambient currents without overwhelming them. In fact, his playing seems so patient and considered that you're unlikely to even detect the album's improvised origins. The Psychic Nature of Being closes with it's longest piece, the 20-minute ""You Are Excrement, You Can Turn Yourself Into Gold"". Not coincidentally, it's this track that could have benefited most from some judicious editing. Building gradually from tiny, bell-like tones, the track eventually takes on a more electric hue as Lowe's flickering guitar accumulates layers of delay and refined distortion. Unfortunately the track's subtle momentum isn't always enough to keep the music from occasionally spilling off into quiet, dormant eddies. And it's during these brief, inactive lapses that the listener may find cause to hope that on the next Lichens release, Lowe will permit himself the luxury of a genuine revision or two.","Enigmatic, contemplative debut from Rob Lowe, singer and bassist for 90 Day Men and new member of TV on the Radio.

Front Parlour Ballads,Richard Thompson,by: Jeff Leven,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78cb1335d7bf1699097/1:1/w_160/2a34c502.jpg,2005-10-11 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8027-front-parlour-ballads/,Cooking Vinyl,"One of the appeals of Richard Thompson is the variety of ways he finds to be obtusely cheeky. Take the disc out of its tray (if you're still into the whole physical copy thing), for instance, and the first thing Front Parlour Ballads treats you to is a coy riff on that Garden State scene juxtaposing a wallpaper-pattern-shirt against wallpaper-pattern-wallpaper. The only sign of restraint is that Thompson still insists on wearing that same old black beret, which, in and of itself, one suspects, is a back-handed piss-take good for a self-satisfied smirk when the bloody interviewer comes calling. Throughout Thompson's storied career, his rich, deep heavily-accented voice and reverence for the deepest corners of Anglo-Celtic acoustic tradition haven't always been inviting to casual rockers, even if more mainstream acts like Dire Straits all but owe their existence to his subtle guitar stabs and lacey arpeggios. But a close listen to his songs tends to reveal a punk personality treacherously lurking amidst the baroque sea balladry and wispy references to the lull of the Thames. Front Parlour Ballads offers the traditional Thompson mix of lush folk beauty and cruel knife-twisting lyrics. The album is largely acoustic, saving its electricity for rousing effect on songs like opener ""Let It Blow"", in which a honeymooning cad baldly tells his bride ""as she lay on the sand he said, isn't it grand? I bring all my wives to this spot."" While tempered by pained romantic moments like those found in ""Cressida"" and ""For Whose Sake"", Thompson is often apt to vent caustic middle-aged spleen on a world of sodden domestic mouth-breathers, relegating them to the dustbin of the heart with observations like ""perhaps she doesn't want to see the heel that you've turned out to be, that's why she'll take a gin or three to drive doubts from her head."" Meanwhile, ""When We Were Boys at School"" is an Old World literati equivalent of Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"", although rather than biting the recess lady's breast Thompson's bullied lad ends up running some form of a military empire-- the one vague if abstract political gesture on an otherwise personal album. At times Thompson overreaches or comes across as heavy-handed-- albums that namecheck Nietzsche, Rawicz, and Hannibal tend to do that. Indeed, if someone tells you Front Parlour Ballads is a party album, that person is probably an Oxbridge medievalist on an absinthe bender. But for us less tweedy Yanks, there is still much to love amidst Thompson's proverbial light and shade, gorgeous guitar work and gallows humo(u)r.","Largely acoustic album mixes lush folk beauty and cruel knife-twisting lyrics.

Chandeliers in the Savannah,Neon Blonde,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9885e6ef959693229a9/1:1/w_160/f453883d.jpg,2005-10-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5921-chandeliers-in-the-savannah/,Dim Mak,"Neon Blonde is a Blood Brothers side project comprised of vocalist Johnny Whitney and drummer Mark Gajadahr, and it's worth cutting to the chase in regards to the similarities between the two: If your main beef with Blood Brothers is Whitney's cats-fucking-in-an-alley vocal style, Neon Blonde might not be your thing. His vocals are flamboyant, manic, and completely over-the-top on Chandeliers in the Savannah, Neon Blonde's first full length. The main difference between Blood Brothers and Neon Blonde, however, is that instead of the searing, angst-fueled punk rock, this disc hands over track after track of eclectic electro-trash and danceable noise rock. The band excels at combining stripped-down electric beats and synths with more organic elements, such as piano, acoustic guitar, and saxophone. Many of the album's stronger tracks feature the piano as the prominent instrument, including ""Chandeliers and Vines"", an almost tender ballad if not for the 20-second wall-of-noise freak-out in the middle. On the other hand, jagged guitar lines and simple programmed beats assault the listener elsewhere on the disc, with Whitney channeling Brainiac's Timmy Taylor in full-on spazzcore mode. It's that sort of track-to-track variety that keeps Chandeliers in the Savannah interesting. While ""Black Cactus Killers"", ""Princess Skullface Sings"", and ""Dead Mellotron"" rattle with heart attack inducing rock, ""Crystal Beaches Never Turned Me On"" and ""The Future Is a Mesh Stallion"" are as dance as they are punk. The band touches on a bit of everything, from glam to post-punk to lounge, and slams it all together like they're using some sort warped Cronenberg creation made from the spare parts of old Casio keyboards. Chandeliers in the Savannah is dark, mysterious, and challenging, but ultimately rewarding. It never feels contrived, never odd for the sake of being odd. And although there's definitely a sense of improvisation and freewheeling here, the band is precise, tight when it's necessary, and never excessively sloppy. Whitney's voice fits perfectly with this style. Whereas in his primetime gig, his voice is jarring, at times almost gimmicky, here it's just one more layer in an already flavor-rich pie. On ""Headlines"", released as a single earlier this year, he goes from high-pitched trilling to scratchy and strained with ease, all while the repetitive drum beat and driving piano drone on behind him. ""Love Hounds"" features rapid-fire, almost spoken verses over guitar caterwauling, and then slides into the disc's catchiest chorus. Actually, that's another thing working in Neon Blonde's favor; they're hardly afraid of a good hook. Chaos and melody tango throughout the disc, dipping and spinning, and never leading the other where you'd expect.","Side project from Blood Brothers vocalist Johnny Whitney and drummer Mark Gajadahr.

Tournament of Hearts,Constantines,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6535e6ef95969320ce4/1:1/w_160/c8d73c68.jpg,2005-10-10 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1591-tournament-of-hearts/,Sub Pop,"Curling is a people's game, but while the Canadian women's curling championship, the Tournament of Hearts, is a professional competition, there are no full-time pro-curlers. Ontario's Constantines, too, counterbalance their work-- their allusiveness and unblunted riffs-- with a rough-hewn populism. Their songs might conjure the ghosts of Italian futurists, obscure 50s casualties, or Rod Stewart, but they ultimately bleed with love, rock 'n' roll, and the booze-stained nights that follow workaday days. The band's self-titled debut clamored for the death of rock music, while 2003's equally impressive Shine a Light saw a great band building its dank, proletarian vision, dancing through alleyways, too drunk to steer or to stop. Third album Tournament of Hearts stumbles to its factory job the next morning, shakes out the cobwebs, and turns the radio dial to classic rock. It's gentler than its predecessors, relying on sweat and unresolved tension rather than a glorious gutter-poet deluge, though the change is more of subtleties than of substance. Here, the band consecrates not the grand passions of Shine a Light but the everyday labors of nurses, phone operators, and working stiffs ""from Herald Square to the heavens, earth, and sea."" In depicting ordinary people, the Constantines unabashedly evoke bands that ordinary people might like. ""Working Fulltime"", inspired by the work of 93-year-old Chicago journalist and oral historian Studs Terkel, nods toward Bachman-Turner Overdrive in its title and simple, power-chord refrain, then dives into a G'n'R twin-guitar breakdown. ""We will not be undersold,"" singer/guitarists Bry Webb and Steve Lambke grimly chant, after insisting, ""We wake up every morning full of wonder."" The album's most immediate track, ""Soon Enough"", is nearly as direct and overpowering as Shine a Light's immortal ""On to You"", but with a soft, countrified strum rather than its predecessor's punk-derived tumult. ""Work and love will make a man out of you,"" Webb repeats, his still-throaty vocals sounding as subdued as the arrangement. It's not that Tournament of Hearts doesn't rock, but it's more constrained, finding power in withheld but ever-imminent explosions. Opener ""Draw Us Lines"" drones over a single guitar chord, name-dropping San Francisco eco-witch Starhawk over pounding drums out of a pagan ritual. ""Hotline Operator""-- not to be confused with the Nighttime/Anytime EP's same-named instrumental-- builds pressure with whispery choruses before a final, all-too-brief double-time coda and anguished wail. A few of the tracks draw on the sludge-rock side of former tourmates Oneida, such as the greasy guitar of ""Lizaveta"", which also revisits ""Insectivora"" horns. Elsewhere, the looser ""Good Nurse"" puts the band's recent stint as Neil Young cover band Horsey Craze to good use. But the most unrestrained track is standout ""Love in Fear"", with its elliptical bass and guitars whining like sirens, as Webb implores, ""Just kiss me on a rooftop.../ Under helicopters of desire."" Lambke, who provided lead vocals on Shine a Light's jagged ""Scoundrel Babes"", takes the forefront twice on Tournament. His thin, unprojected voice is in stark contrast with Webb's Greg Dulli-like gruffness, though the lyrics about abattoirs and life in the city on the cool, horn-laden ""Thieves"" could just as easily come out of Webb's mouth. Acoustic closer ""Windy Road"" is a brave misstep, shooting for Iron & Wine but ending up someplace whinier, despite the Constantines' usual lyrical prowess: ""Best get new dreams/ These old dreams won't last,"" Lambke murmurs. The metaphorical battle-of-sexes resonance of Tournament of Hearts is obvious, but curling is also a deeply Canadian sport. Webb sings of ""pissing rain"" and ""the weird winds of Ontario"" as his songs detail Canadian blue-collar paycheck-to-paycheck. Amid the glacial guitar strums and funereal percussion of ""You Are a Conductor"", the penultimate track, he bestows upon his subjects what working life sometimes takes away: control, or, more specifically, the ability to direct one's own path, like a curler's broom hurrying hard to make way for the rock (the rock!). ""Shamble on,"" Webb moans, more softly than ever.","Curling is a people's game, but while the Canadian women's curling championship, the Tournament of Hearts, is a ...

The Swimmer EP,Tren Brothers,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8aa9d034d5c69bf3ad5/1:1/w_160/a124a0e4.gif,2005-10-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8302-the-swimmer-ep/,Western Vinyl,"At this point the Dirty Three are perhaps more interesting when pulled apart. The music violinist Warren Ellis, guitarist Mick Turner, and drummer Jim White make together is not only immediately recognizable as a sound, it's also a persistent exploration of very specific emotional terrain. So while ""Dirty Three"" is clear shorthand for tightly circumscribed set of musical values, the members' other projects retain a certain flexibility. Turner and White periodically work together as Tren Brothers, with Turner adding flourishes of melodica to fill in chords while his guitar lines meander. That last word is important. Tren Brother pieces, though airy and spacious and generally short, are not economical. The spark driving this music is intuition and process is paramount. Mick Turner, like a bat searching for food by sending out a variably pitched scale ultrasonic tones, gradually teases out melody by unwinding jittery arpeggios to see which ones stick. White is his ultimate foil, with his astonishingly free and original approach to drums wherein actual timekeeping is far down the list of priorities. This concise record was released as part of Western Vinyl's Portrait Series. Each of its four tracks is accompanied on CD by a video, all of which consist of time-lapse shots of Mick Turner creating a painting (including the sleeve art). Turner and White as ever seem inspired by restrictions, reaching their greatest heights on the repetitive vamps of the title track and ""Crow #3"". On the former White flails away, trying like hell to bash his way out of the song's structure, while Turner lewdly fondles his instrument and keeps the strings ringing. ""Crow #3"" inches along to that off-kilter lurch these guys made famous, the ultimate soundtrack to a blind-drunk walk home alone beneath a star-lit sky. Welcome swells of melodica add that extra pinch of yearning. The Swimmer is good stuff all around, but there's something missing. Secretly Canadian released a Tren Brothers 7-inch in 1998 that happens to contain my bar-none favorite slice of D-3-related music on the B-side, the endlessly climbing two-chord epic ""Kit's Choice"". At such a moment the searching quality in their approach leads to a moment of real ecstasy. The Swimmer never quite gets to that sublime place these guys sometime stumble upon.","Dirty Three guitarist Mick Turner and drummer Jim White create airy and spacious tracks with this side project.

Pocket Revolution,dEUS,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b979c0084474cd0c2608/1:1/w_160/89d6c43e.jpg,2005-10-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2300-pocket-revolution/,V2,"The members of dEUS named their band after God, which takes no small amount of chutzpah. It also sets the bar kind of high. I imagine that if God made music it'd be pretty special, maybe the kind of thing that would physically blow your mind out your ear or herald the Earth's final destruction. Think about how disappointing it would be if God was on the bill and you got a milquetoast singer-songwriter or boring lap-pop. dEUS' music isn't godly, but in the second half of the 90s they released three very good albums that weren't easily pigeonholed. The first two in particular hop from genre to genre, while 1999's The Ideal Crash took all their manic eccentricity and channeled it into a slightly more accessible package. Six years later, Pocket Revolution continues that evolution with a sharp, direct attack that undoubtedly has more commercial potential than anything they've released before. This comes at the expense of the messy charm that made their early music so enjoyably chaotic, but anyone who originally liked them for the Frank Zappa, Charles Mingus, Don Cherry, and Captain Beefheart affinities they once flew like a flag won't be totally disappointed, as their music still has those elements. They're just packaged more subtly. Case in point is ""Cold Sun of Circumstance"", a wildly rhythmic song stuffed with faux blues riffage and frenetic vocals. The main thing separating it from the craziness of In a Bar, Under the Sea is the band's restrained production, which has a smoothing effect on all of the material. The proggier songs are held back a bit by the approach-- ""What We Talk About (When We Talk About Love)"" in particular features a monster rhythm track topped with Beefheartian interjections and could have had the same explosive quality of ""Fell Off the Floor, Man"" with looser engineering-- but the band's pop side is finally given full flower, so it's a trade-off. In the past, songs like ""Little Arithmetics"" were almost token bones thrown to the European singles charts, but ""7 Days, 7 Weeks"" is the closest thing to a sure hit they've written. Tom Barman's double-tracked vocals throw off the song's cloak of heavy ambient keyboard, the mellow verses abetted by e-bowed guitar and mellotron. It's catchy in the same way R.E.M. once were-- not in your face with its hooks, just very precise about how they're placed. The band also embraces vocal harmonies whole hog on Pocket Revolution, a step that hugely enriches songs like ""Include Me Out"", which comes across as sort of a half-way point between Pink Floyd and late-60s folk-pop. And then there's closer ""Nothing Really Ends"", a which borders on lounge (in a good way) with its cocktail drums, vibes and sturdy, crooner-worthy melody. So dEUS have settled down with age and returned from their hiatus as a more craft-conscious, restrained rock band. I'd be lying if I said I liked them more this way than I did for In a Bar..., but as transitions go, they've made the leap to greater maturity with a lot of grace. Pocket Revolution is an accomplished re-introduction to one of Belgium's greatest exports.","Veteran Belgian band trades some of its messy charm for a more accessible, commercial sound.

Elephant Eyelash,WHY?,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa2d5e6ef95969321542/1:1/w_160/793356a6.jpg,2005-10-10 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8672-elephant-eyelash/,Anticon,"I'll admit that I didn't ""get"" Why? on his early records, like that split EP with Odd Nosdam from 2001, where his puzzling lyrics and images are as fragmented as the clips of music he samples. It was like listening to the kids outside your window who are locked into their own in-jokes and use their own slang for sex acts: I just figured, you either get it or you're out. Somehow, his farther-out colleague and cLOUDDEAD partner Doseone was easier to follow, maybe because his jester act steers you more directly to his heart. Dose has said about Why?, ""I met him at 18 and he was 40."" And you get that vibe from Why?, aka Yoni Wolf, more on every album. On Elephant Eyelash, Why? has moved even closer to using plain old song forms and he formed a live band to play them that includes Wolf's brother Josiah on drums, guitarist Matt Meldon, and Doug McDiarmid on anything else. Recorded in DIY lo-fi, they have better chemisty than when they debuted on the Sanddollars EP earlier this year. In fact, Wolf shrugged off his Why? alias and turned it into the name of his band-- which may violate the Hip-Hop Local 712 union regulations, but what the hey, they're underground. In fact, forget about whether Wolf's career belongs in hip-hop or indie rock or jangle-psych or whatever: By now his music has oozed so far away from a clear-cut genre that the whoom-pa beats he's sometimes fond of could have been inspired by polka. The same goes for his fully-developed, fully-original vocals. His speak-singing lays packages of words one after another with attention to every syllable, dropping them in sequence like he's laying a stone path. But his pop songs showcase his singing, which starts off like he's reading his journal to a bored girlfriend, then takes flight in an impassioned croon. Elephant Eyelash sounds less crisp and less striking than the folk-plus-beats arrangements of 2003's Oaklandazurasylum, but it brings more heart; where that earlier album's lyrics crackled with the anxiety of beating yourself up after a bad day at school, Elephant Eyelash soars like the last songs on prom night.You'll still puzzle over the lyrics-- Wolf says he's writing about a break-up, though don't let that limit your imagination-- but the emotional intent is blindingly clear. The music pours and soars over the splintered images, like on 'Sanddollars, which uses a triumphantly conventional pop anthem to make its chorus sound like a mountaintop declaration: ""These are selfish times/I've got shellfish dimes/ And sanddollars."" Yet he tops that with the huge, heart-pounding piano chords on ""Rubber Traits"", which propel him as he belts: ""Unfold an origami death mask/ And cut my DNA with rubber traits/ Pull apart the double helix like a wishbone/ Always be working on a suicide note."" And I finally understand how he feels.","On this lo-fi DIY release, Why? moves closer than ever to using typical song structures and forms a live band to perform his tracks.

"We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 1 / Vol. 2",Clipse,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11ac0084474cd0bfd28/1:1/w_160/8a2ca4c9.jpg,2005-10-10 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11708-we-got-it-4-cheap-vol-1-vol-2/,mixunit.com,"Left for dead more than two years ago, Malice and Pusha T-- aka Clipse, two-hit wonders if there ever were some-- had no damn right doing this. This is not what's supposed to happen to these guys. After their label, Arista, messily merged with J Records, the duo was shuffled to Jive/Zomba, an imprint historically unable to market gritty hip-hop. For a brief moment, the Brothers Thornton sat idly, intermittently whining about their still-forthcoming album Hell Hath No Fury, and plotting their return. But lacking the backing of den mother Pharrell Williams, who launched their careers with ""Grindin'"" and produced their entire debut with partner Chad Hugo, Clipse were toast. So, of course, in an attempt to stonewall Jive into voiding their contract, they recorded the year's most astonishing mixtape series, We Got It 4 Cheap. And when forced to pick up the pieces and carry on, talkin' and sellin' shit, Malice and Pusha recruited two baritone toughs from Philly, Ab-Liva and Sandman, to round out their new incarnation. The result is the Re-Up Gang, a supergroup in the most undistinguished sense. Ab-Liva and Sandman are the stylistic opposite of Clipse, burly in voice and muddy in inflection, intensifying most tracks, but usually just acting as foils. All vocals are mixed way upfront by DJ/entrepreneur Clinton Sparks, easier to hear over instrumentals you already know. Subtle choices like these make We Got It 4 Cheap's two volumes-- and chiefly Volume 2-- the best examples of what a mixtape can be. Bigger than just that new shit you cop from Canal St., these demonstrate that mixtapes, like albums, can be an art form. Mixing, scratching, beat choice, reconfiguring choruses-- all come into play, elevating typical songwriting into philosophical, deconstructionist terms. ""How can I make this better?"" ""This beat would sound hotter if we rapped on it,"" etc. Have we talked drugs yet? That's what they do here; talk the art of the deal and their mastery of such. It sounds simplistic, but Clipse have been the premier drug-dealing soliloquists for some time. Unflinching and unforgiving, Re-Up re-imagine hustler as hero with lyrical ingenuity and deft wordplay. Some may struggle with the joy these boys get from moving weight; it's an indefensible stance-- we all have our faults, and we all have to eat-- but the revelry is also what makes it enjoyable. Otherwise, Clipse could just move West and write for scripts for Michael Mann. Volume 1, which hit back in January, is too long, and it's overrun with suspect beat selection and too many references to HBO's ""The Wire"". It's anti-populist and too short on the MCs in demand, Malice and Pusha, who appear on about half the songs. But it's also far stronger than most releases like it, featuring a reinvigorated crew and one killer freestyle (""Coast to Coast""). Tracks like ""Studin' Y'all"" and ""Pussy (Remix)"" made them seem relevant again, too. A few months later, ""Zen"" fell from the sky (onto their website) and the divide was drawn. Once a tremendously gifted but one-dimensional singles crew, Clipse took their talents to new heights with the abrasively dynamic song. Teeming with quotables (""I sell that ostrich, I'm so obnoxious""; ""Two diamond jump rope, my neck do the double dutch""; ""All I see blackface and you singin' 'Mammy'""), Clipse were possessed by a new vigor. They were clever before, sure, but now everyone-- especially the contemptuously nasal Pusha-- had become transcendent. Volume 2 delivers on the promise of ""Zen"". In alternating mismanaged heaters (""So Seductive"", the murderous ""Kobra""), hugely successful singles (""1 Thing"", ""Hate It or Love It""), and timeless thrillers (""Elevators"", ""Daytona 500""), the pacing never slows. It would be too easy to list punchline after punchline, but to put it simply, Pusha, whose scintillating word choice and deft phrasing can be frightening, takes Timbaland's ""Put You on the Game"" and makes it his anthem on ""What's Up"". His verse barks and prances at once: ""Cop the sorbet/ Straight from Jorge/ Jack of all trades/ Even mastered the gourmet/ Plus the price got the street tongue in cheek/ Cook it till it's Al Dente/ Muah, magnifique!"" The second volume also features key contributions from Pharrell who's still rapping (mostly awkwardly) but is apparently writing his own lyrics, according to Pusha on a humorously assertive interlude. Skateboard P's flow is jumbled but his sentiments are personal on ""Maybe (Remix)"" where he reveals insecurities about uncleared samples over the ""Elevators"" beat (""You and me/ BAPE, Ice Cream, and BBC""). Finally, some vulnerability. The tape ends on a tranquil note with ""Ultimate Flow"". Lifting the strummy, nearly forgotten instrumental from Lil' Kim's ""Drugs"", Pusha offers a summation of the conquest: ""I draw this off inspiration, you trace shit."" Things still aren't right with the world (""Nigga, fuck Zomba/ I sell nose candy.../ Willy Wonka""). And the future of Hell Hath No Fury is still unknown. Some joker at Amazon.com even set the release date for January 1, 2020. Perhaps someone at Jive should take notice-- a lot of people still care about these rogues.","Left for dead by industry mergers, Pusha and Malice enjoy a dramatic resurrection via the RIAA-baiting mixtape circuit.

Metropolis,Swords,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c313d1975652139269/1:1/w_160/4a81db25.jpg,2005-10-09 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7834-metropolis/,Arena Rock,"Finally, after the onslaught of Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain sound-alikes in modern rock, Michael Stipe gets his own vocal doppelganger-- Swords singer/bassist Corey Ficken. Not to dwell on the likeness, but damnnn...this dude mirrors Stipey's breathy croon, whiney yelps, and penchant for vague, impressionistic lyrics to a T. Oh yeah, and he hates conservatives, too. Fortunately though, this Portland, Ore., six-piece does better service to R.E.M. than, say, Creed and the Vines respectively did to Pearl Jam and Nirvana, and judging by these high-concept lyrics and song structures, they're obviously not looking to cash in on a teenage demographic raring to buy anything resembling their older siblings' fav records. Now to loosen up these R.E.M. handcuffs; until this album these guys were making a serious case for the ""American Mogwai"" title. Not that Metropolis reveals a sudden interested in perfecting the three-minute folk-pop song, but here Ficken doesn't let his vocals get upstaged by violins or chimes. While over half the songs from their first album, Entertainment Is Over if You Want It (recorded as Swords Project), reached well past the five-minute mark, Metropolis trims down the average song length to about four-and-a-half minutes. The result? Imagine the hooks of New Adventures in Hi-Fi and Up boiled down and vulcanized into heady, sprawling post-punk, all saccharine melodies with artificial sweeteners. Fortunately, the synergy between guitarists Ryan Stowe and Jeffrey Gardner continues flourishing despite the increase in cogent melodies. Haunting raga riffs adorn opening anti-war polemic ""Product of Harm"", recalling Peter Buck's obscurer works like ""I Remember California"" and ""Oddfellows Local 151"" while Ficken seemingly plagiarizes Stipe's anti-Bush harangues: ""Substitute words with revolvers, baby/ This scene's got a western theme."" However, as both the song's closing lines (""A crimson pool the liquid spilling in/ Cut to empty space"") and band's previous album title punctuate, Ficken's biggest beef is with media and its effect on the masses. On ""Radio Radio"", Stowe and Gardner intermittently fire fractured guitar squeals, playing the ambulance to Ficken's cries of ""Medical, medical please get me out!"" as he plays the role of a radio playing shitty music. ""Savage Republic"" offers a more palatable, and sensical, criticism, showcasing the band at their most playful. While the guitars evoke skittish Clash reggae, Ficken lampoons poseurs and blind followers in perhaps his most direct attack: ""'Love this song/ Hummed it all day long'/ Hate this song/ Dance to it all night long."" Not exactly Art Brut here, but Ficken makes the most of his modest charisma without sacrificing the band's instrumental textures and complexities. Hell, at one point the dude comes out of his shell enough to jab at the NYC music scene. Sure, the hooks may sputter, the ""atmosphere"" has its holes, and Swords'll leave you pining for a certain Athens band in their prime, but there's something admirable about some guys from Portland trying to rejuvenate activism in indie rock-- as long as it's not by personifying a radio.","Portland, Ore., six-piece channels R.E.M. to decent effect.

First Light's Freeze,Castanets,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71513d1975652139322/1:1/w_160/e7cbb0c4.jpg,2005-10-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1775-first-lights-freeze/,Asthmatic Kitty,"""I do not want to explain, and I'm not going to,"" Raymond Raposa sings on ""Dancing With Someone (Privilege of Everything)"". He's not just whistling ""Dixie"", although come to think of it, doing so wouldn't be out of place on First Light's Freeze. Barring a couple of surprisingly lean, poppy tracks, the second Castanets album picks up where the first left off, stringing together disembodied fragments of gothic Americana with brief, freaky interludes. All the hallmarks of the first album are intact-- the E-bowed drones, gusty reverberations, distant chimes, sparse acoustic dirges, and rattling percussion. If the torpid, disarticulated songs often threaten to fall apart completely, the presence of Raposa's quietly commanding voice provides a center, shining through the murk like a strong flashlight submerged in a swamp. Raposa's skill as a singer and a lyricist are inextricably linked. His voice has a drifting, spectral quality that's perfectly suited to his overlapping images. Like John Ashbery, he's able to sustain pointed ambiguity for the duration of a composition, taking all around the thing without saying it. One of Cathedral's most chilling moments came on ""No Light To Be Found (Fare Thee Faith, the Path Is Yours)"", with the line, ""There was no light to be found in you."" Its impact stemmed from the way that Raposa's plaintive voice changed upon its delivery, dropping into an ominous purr, an effect he revives with equal potency on First Light's Freeze's ""Bells Aloud"" with the line, ""Don't it get difficult?"". Instead of just hearing about bone-deep weariness, you hear it, as if Raposa can no longer hold the song aloft and lets it slip to the floor. Raposa's lyrics are also marked by a penchant for litotes, one that's in full force here, which amplifies the album's sense of fatalism and futility. I cannot befriend you true; there is no sweetness to send; no true work to be done; no sure and simple fun that we don't pay for; no song was sung; we were not taught one thing that we could learn. Raposa's a romantic, but too cynical to believe in it, and so instead of singing an ode to his perfect world, he sings an elegy to its absence. ""I am not walking with a wife/ She won't be running with the dogs,"" he intones on ""A Song is not the Song of the World"", one of two exceptions to the album's diffuse mien. The other is ""No Voiced was Raised"", yet another negation. Both tracks feature lean click-tracks and crunchy rock embellishments; they're uncommonly kinetic for a Castanets album, but if they're peppier in sound, ultimately, they're just as grim in tone: ""No one jailed us,"" Raposa sings on the latter, ""haphazard hearts took no sure stance.""","Raymond Raposa picks up where he left off, stringing together disembodied fragments of gothic Americana with brief, freaky interludes.

Live04,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e85e6ef9596932392e/1:1/w_160/6dfa9853.jpg,2005-10-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5468-live04/,Sonig,"There will always be something a little iffy about a live album from an act that relies heavily on computers. The live album has usually been there to capture a moment, something presumably spurred by the excitement of artists walking the performance tightrope in real time. The more you rely on the playback of digital sound files, the more likely we are to wonder why you don't just mix in the studio rather than onstage. Mouse on Mars in concert goes well beyond file management. In the touring configuration they've had in place since 2001, with Dodo Nkishi on drums and vocals, Andi Toma on bass guitar and electronics, and the busy Jan St. Werner piloting from the bridge, Mouse on Mars shows are unpredictable, occasionally sloppy, and relentlessly fun. It's not that they're recreating the renowned complexity of the records live. My guess is roughly 70% of everything the audience hears comes from one of St. Werner's machines, but there's still a fair amount of wiggle room for the imperfect human element. Something about the way Nkishi's spazzy live drumming mingles with the programmed beats, or the way a Toma bassline might slip momentarily behind the tempo of the sequencer, adds an appealing layer of awkwardness to music that lends itself to imperfection. The first Mouse on Mars live album was pieced together from shows recorded during the band's extensive 2004 tours, and it's a good snapshot of how they sounded last year. Pleasantly short at nine songs and 56 minutes, Live04 sounds minimally retouched in the studio. The setlist spans the band's career. Three songs from Radical Connector, one from Idiology, three from Niun Niggung, one from Autoditacker, and one from Vulvaland. About half the tracks contains vocals, and though Nkishi sings live, fragments of his voice are constantly being ensnared in St. Werner's digital net and mixed in as pure sound. Generally speaking songs make do with slightly less clutter, though it's still a busy environment with rich, cartoonish color. The best moments showcase the band's remarkable musical humor. The frantic ""Distroia"" lurches madly from bar-to-bar, building steam through variations on its stomping, distorted rhythm before exploding into a tuneful hook that would make Harold Faltermeyer proud. ""Twift"" makes one yearn for the lovable goofiness the band displayed in the mid-90s, with another synth riff worth building a career on and splashy fills from Nkishi. ""Wipe That Sound"" goes on a tad long but is a highlight, with its gradual builds to the explosive chorus. As did the last show I saw, the set closes with ""Frosch"", the first Mouse on Mars single, first released in 1994. This version is faster, funnier, and more dramatic than the original record, with an epic chord progression designed to send shivers when it kicks in after a sequencer break. It's difficult to fault the set list or the performances, and if the sound quality occasionally sounds a tad flat next to the meticulously layered records, in this context the crudeness seems appropriate. With the readily apparent crowd noise and the occasionally dodgy mix, Live04 almost sounds more like an audience recording. If there were quiet moments you could probably hear people talking next to the microphones, but Mouse on Mars in performance generally avoids quiet moments. Live04 is a soundtrack to a raucous little party.","The first Mouse on Mars live album, this was pieced together from shows recorded during the band's extensive 2004 tours.

The Runners Four,Deerhoof,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f7b1335d7bf16993e2/1:1/w_160/1d1d558d.jpg,2005-10-09 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2256-the-runners-four/,Kill Rock Stars,"Pitchfork: You opened for Wilco recently. How was that? Greg Saunier: When I was in the audience, watching their show, they would start a song, and people next to me would start hugging each other because they loved that song. And I thought that was something that I would really aspire to. To do something where music becomes-- and this sounds ridiculous or pretentious or something-- but where music becomes more than just good music.* * * Any band taking cues from Wilco-- let alone the best band in the world-- that's hard to stomach. Says Dominique Leone, ""You don't always have to sound poignant to make poignant music."" But I appreciate Deerhoof's challenge here: to comb hair without cutting it, to wash face without popping all the pimples, to be the best band in the world, but beyond that, to be the most lovable, too. So tomorrow, Deerhoof put on their Tuesday best and release their first straight-up guitar-rock album-- short, dense songs packed into familiar forms, full-bodied vocals for unabashed, often gut-punching melodies, less herk-jerk, less of that house-of-cards spirit that coursed through Reveille and Apple O. Some people will miss that. Milk Man, Pt. 2? Not really. Deerhoof aren't holding back here so much as redistributing their energies; where before we found cute in the grotesque, now the opposite. My offer: I'll concede that Milk Man was poppy, watered down, desperate love shit if you'll actually listen close to The Runners Four and realize that it's onto something else entirely-- by turns jubilant, confused, afraid, angry, sad, relieved, all pretty poignant, yes. They've made us a hugging record. Nothing ridiculous or pretentious about hugging. Almost twice the length of their other LPs, The Runners Four plays not as one big song, but as three swoops of six or seven. That first swoop (from ""Chatterboxes"" to ""Odyssey"") might dishearten the diehard, at least initially. Drummer Saunier, famed for his freakish battery, barely touches the set, but in his absence we get compositional tension, which is sometimes more intense than Saunier's top-down. Dueling guitar lines bristle close in the rub (""Chatterboxes""), and harmonics stab away at Chris Cohen's existential pirate ballad ""Odyssey"": ""Pirates on an odyssey/ We ask the captain 'What will be?'"" Now pirates count for some of the biggest douchebags this world has ever seen, but they get scared, too-- people forget that. ""Wrong Time Capsule"" starts swoop #2 with Runners' most on-the-sleeves guitar riff, a cry to echo singer Satomi's dejected message in a bottle: ""Don't forget me yesterday/ 'Cause today's no place to stay."" The trill stays fever-high with unison chants on guitars and vox (""Scream Team""), folksy-bluesy confessions/comeuppance on ""After Me the Deluge"" (""Middle love I did do you harm whenever I want to""), up to ""Siriustar"", Deerhoof's sparse-to-gigantic guitar anthem, like nothing they've written before. I think it's about a werewolf. The next third dips into more emotionally resonant stuff-- the furthest capitulation of Deerhoof's animalism so far, where lyrically they can guess the emotions of all things living (people being chased by spies) or non-living (lightning rods). We can wonder, as they do, if lemons are sad when we eat them, stuff like that, though Deerhoof make sure to push things inside-out, rescuing something human from the rumination. Runners' gut-puncher, the third swoop rounds out with ""You're Our Two"" as needly guitar lines sandwich Satomi's image-heavy paranoia: ""Cast afloat on icy water/ Can I really leave?"" then ""Ark sailing/ Believe all fools or die."" A somber if slightly perplexing note to end on, it's the right one for this album. But Deerhoof don't leave us there. Instead they give us ""RRRRRRight"", a chirpy, stark, primitive cut á la ""Come See the Duck"". Of course, after an album so unafraid to ask for our love, Satomi's ga-gas and oompah-oompahs feel somewhat inconsequential. Then I saw Deerhoof play the song live and understood why they have it here: The song is ginger, a palette cleanser as much for us as for them. Love what happened, they ask, forget what happened, start all over again. ","Pitchfork: You opened for Wilco recently. How was that?

Fall Heads Roll,The Fall,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd41abf31b7dc7155ee9/1:1/w_160/244f442e.jpg,2005-10-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2980-fall-heads-roll/,Narnack,"For a band with such a devoted cult following, the Fall are rarely covered by other groups. It's hardly surprising, of course, given the group's general disdain for standard song structures and Mark E. Smith's general-uh disdain-uh for everything, including conventional singing. For the same reasons, it's always jarring to hear the Fall doing someone else's song. When I first heard their version of the Kinks' ""Victoria"", I could scarcely believe it was real, and I still don't like it. Perhaps I'm too attached to the stunning original to bother with the exponentially higher level of sarcasm Smith brings to the table. I'm not quite as attached to the Move's ""I Can Hear the Grass Grow"", but it's among my favorite nuggets from the UK's late-60s psychedelic explosion, a brilliantly arranged song that married trippy lyrics and harmonies to a brawling mod rave-up. Smith and his latest lineup naturally strip away all of those elements when they tackle the song in the middle of Fall Heads Roll, their 80th or 90th album. By the time they're done with it, the poor song is lying in a little broken heap, laid out by Smith's singing-not-singing and the band's frantic evisceration of the original's complex, multi-part arrangement. It's not an improvement, but it's different, and the Fall have undeniably made it their own. I don't know if Smith intends sarcasm on ""I Can Hear the Grass Grow"", but it's hard not to hear it. The guy fairly drips with it-- it's like an appendage of his body at this point, and it gets him plenty of sneering mileage on Fall Heads Roll, a grab-bag of a Fall album with brilliant highs and scattered lows. In other words, it's exactly what Fall followers are hoping for, and it continues the band's recent run of strong work, even reviving a few promising songs from the dead zone of last year's unforgivably sloppy Interim compilation. ""Blindness"", for example, comes back in its third incarnation. With each subsequent revision, the song has grown longer and nastier, and here, the incessant bass crunch and hovering guitar parts drip with fury. Other highlights include the buzzing synth romp ""Pacifying Joint"", a New Romantics-on-skid-row joint crowned with a vintage MES tantrum, delivered in a slurred anti-pop drawl. ""Bo D"" blazes on a mind-fuck Bo Diddley beat, but Smith seems to be ranting about Bo Derek as much as the man who gave rock'n'roll its swagger. For once, Smith's utter inscrutability comes off as more charming than threatening, and he sounds like he's having a grand old time getting cheesed off at the world throughout the record. Check his ""you're always a work in progress"" taunt on ""Ya Wanner"", which sounds almost playfully directed at himself. If the Fall make any mistakes on Fall Heads Roll, it's simply carrying on for too long. The end of the record feels disposable, with the partly acoustic ""Early Days of Channel Fuhrer"" providing variety but not much else, while ""Breaking the Rules"" bites the melody of ""Walk Like a Man"" for its synth part and essentially serves the same function as ""Pacifying Joint"", to lesser effect. Smith doesn't even seem to appear on closer ""Trust in Me"" (either that or he's pretending to be a bargain basement Thurston Moore), and as a result, the finale is anticlimactic. Still, overall the Fall remain, ever shockingly, in excellent form.","Latest from MES continues his band's recent run of strong work, even reviving a few promising songs from the dead zone of last year's unforgivably sloppy Interim compilation.

"Thunder, Lightning, Strike [U.S.]",The Go!

After millions of years of predator-avoidance natural selection, we've evolved the ability to discriminate very slight differences in frequency and to recall entire sequences of tones from memory. [NOTE: statement not applicable in Kansas and Harrisburg, Pa.] In modern times, we've harnessed this fantastic skill for truly awe-inspiring tasks, such as perfectly beat-matching LCD Soundsystem into New Order, or scowling derisively when a band's rhythm guitarist is a half-step out of tune. These wondrous abilities are what had me dreading the American reissue of the Go! Team's excellent debut Thunder, Lightning, Strike. If you haven't heard the backstory, this lawyer-stuffed country made it difficult for the Go! Team to clear the original album's samples for domestic release, forcing the band to slightly tweak the material in order to purge the recordings of legal pitfalls. In addition, the record was reportedly given a gift certificate to the remastering day spa, a process with the potential to thoughtlessly drain some of the group's messy, homemade charm in the name of fidelity. With an album that's been widely available for over a year, even the smallest changes could prove annoyingly distracting to those who've been with the Go! Team from their blog-hype birth. Fortunately, 1) Thunder, Lightning, Strike is no Paul's Boutique, and 2) Cheerleaders have crappy legal representation. To these obsessive ears, it seems that roughly 95% of the original music is intact, and the differences, where they arise, are minimally distracting. The fanfare horns that kick off ""Junior Kickstart"" might be slightly tweaked, ""Bottle Rocket"" might have a new rap from new frontwoman Ninja, they may have swapped one schmaltzy trumpet solo for another on ""Everyone's a VIP to Someone"", but rarely do the alterations change the character of the song. Even the EPCOT ride through girl-group history ""Ladyflash"", which I had most feared would go under the knife, is left unspoiled by copyright considerations, praise the courts. Equally non-intrusive is the remastering, which does a nice job of housekeeping the extraneous hisses while maintaining the band's collage and needle-in-the-red sensibilities. In fact, the remix doesn't so much clean up the songs' pools of bleedover sound so much as merely stir them up, bringing to the surface some new elements that might not have been so readily apparent on the first release. ""Panther Dash"", for example, seems to contain a lot more power-tool noise-guitar parts than I remembered, reinforcing my impression from their live show that Sonic Youth is just as big an influence as cop themes and Avalanches. With these factors decidedly non-intrusive, the most significant change to Thunder, Lightning, Strike is the promotion of ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"" and ""Hold Yr Terror Close"", formerly both B-sides, to the major league roster. Even this switch isn't all that disorienting, as ""Defeated"" adds a fresh cheerleader track to break up the mostly instrumental middle, and ""Terror"" offers a glimpse of the band's Children's Workshop twee side amidst the swirl of drum breaks and marching band blasts. So the main point of this comparative review is that, well, there really is no comparison to be made. The Go! Team, rather skillfully, navigated the treacherous waters of sample clearance and remastering to prepare a domestic version of Thunder, Lightning, Strike no better or worse than the charming original. As such, it's only fitting to affix the same score upon it.",,8.7,

Still, everything's not lost: Made in China will find its audience-- moody high school girls with jerk boyfriends will listen to this album while scrawling lyrics on their Chucks in multi-colored ball points (probably pink). The album's main setback is its schizo-""love in the 90s is paranoid"" philosophy--scuffed-up ""Sex in the City"" mindset, lusting after problems of girls 10 or 15 years your junior. Hatfield's going on 40 but still stuck in adolescene, complaining, ""I don't want to go to school today/ I just wanna play guitar all day"" on ""Stay Awake"". During ""Digital Penetration""-- is this an 'N Sync cover?-- she protests ""shiny girls with no opinions,"" and parties where everybody knows the words except her; ""Send Money"" has to break some record for most unimpassioned petition for allowance money (albeit from God). But what's she so pissed off about anyway? School hasn't been the root of her problems for years, and while retro stunts do well to remind us of comparatively jaded pseudo-punk femme fatales of yesteryear, what's past is past: ""New Waif"" might portend potentially catchy bulimia-rock (a 90s Bettie Serveert and Velocity Girl vomitfest, at best) but gets old quick: Hatfield has nothing new to say besides ""You don't know what it's like to be perfect,"" and it might explain her perfect-person tendency toward carelessness-- guitar solos, grating vocals (remember that time she picked up smoking to make her voice edgier?), overdone crabbiness-- all signs that point to thinly veiled midlife crisis rock. But Hatfield doesn't care what we think-- doesn't care if we buy her records-- and the half-assedness shows. At best, the inattention doubles up as deeply felt passion; at worst-- and it's mostly always at worst-- it's self-inflicted cuts doused in lemon juice. On ""What Do I Care"", she's shocked when we don't sing her praises-- ""I'm amazed you don't find me delicious/ Look at me, I'm a rock star!""-- and we're shocked she can't see why not.","Self-released record from the former Blake Baby and alt-rock star.

A throbbing dose of 4/4 overdriven pop, the song casually channels the melody from Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Little Fury Things"" via frontman Michael Feerick's smooth delivery, which conveys a sense of angst without over-emoting. It's an impressive feat considering Feerick recorded the album entirely on his own, but after you've heard the first two tracks-- the slow-building, piano-and-strings instrumental ""23 Jewels"" that leads to ""Venus""-- you've pretty much heard the entire record. As the album proceeds, APOF's waves of distorted guitar continue to rise and fall and the instrumental breathers come at just the right moments, but there are no more tricks up Feerick's sleeve. ""Venosa"" delivers jagged guitars and a jaunty melody, and it's followed with another plodding piano-driven instrumental, ""Asphalt (Interlude)"". Even the moments of derivation, like the tape-recorded dialogue over the breakdown in ""Eighty Eight"" or the gradual crescendos and declines of the eight-minute ""Wiper"", seem predictable. At times, the transitions between tracks can be charming-- ""The Ramones Book"" is a modest, maudlin piano ballad that kicks unexpectedly into the soaring shoegaze of ""Local Boy Makes God""-- but the album simply revisits the same couple of sounds. It's not just that the pacing is so methodical it nearly makes the record sterile, or that the best song just reminds me of someone else's better song, but for all of the overhwlelming guitars layered onto these songs, sentimental ballads like ""The Ramones Book"" are what's at the record's heart. My perception might be colored by hearing the ""rustic"" version of ""Venus in Caner"" from that song's single release, a precious acoustic rendition that stands perfectly on it's own. It was a revelation: These tracks aren't bult to bruise, they're bedroom pop in a blanket of distortion as a defense. Feerick's simple melodies sound much more apt with subtle coloration instead of overkill. Amusement Parks on Fire has undeniable focus, but it's moments like ""The Ramones Book"" that reveal the most.","Bedroom pop wrapped in a blanket of distortion.

It's just that their tradition is much older, more rural, and less popular than those of most other indie bands we review here-- Bill Monroe and Ralph Stanley instead of Brian Wilson or Joy Division. I don't mean that observation as a purely negative criticism, but I'm skeptical of Love What You Do in the same way I'm skeptical of Interpol, the Killers, and other bands who hew closely to their influences. Exhibiting the Boys' capable, if unspectacular, picking and fiddling, several songs veer toward re-creation rather than reinterpretation, as though their primary goal is to write songs that sound like they were written decades ago. ""Buildings Are Our Cages"" meditates on our modern social enslavement, using a caterpillar as an exemplar of personal freedom. Addressing unsavory politics via a train metaphor, ""Cannonball"" is the musical equivalent of an old editorial cartoon, with only a mention of Columbine making clear they're talking about the 2000s and not the 1900s. ""Parking Lot Song"" and ""Kiss You Down There"" are faux-randy romps, but does anyone really need a bluegrass song about oral sex? At least I hope the Boys intend the chorus ""I wanna kiss you down there"" as a double entendre. If not, we need to talk. The Boys sound best when they sound thoroughly modern, less beholden to tradition and more focused in the present. Slower and quieter numbers like ""Bordertown"" and ""All Good Dogs"" allow for more candid reflection, making sore thumbs of the faster numbers. Opening the album, ""Sun's Work Undone"" is a tender lament about impossible love, made all the more poignant for Dave Sickmen's rough vocals. But it's ""Alabama Shamrock"" that proves the highlight of Love What You Do. Seeming at first like an ode to the creative freedom of touring, the song eventually complicates its sentiment, aptly and affectingly conveying the out-of-time feeling of being born too late, of identifying so strongly with the past that you can never make the present your home. That the Boys sounds so rooted in the here and now only makes the song more powerful and that makes you wish they'd stick around.","Appalachian bluegrass-tinted folk meets the 00s penchant for revivalism.

The People's Champ,Paul Wall,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab613d1975652139ab7/1:1/w_160/6bf8e4b1.jpg,2005-10-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8804-the-peoples-champ/,AtlanticSwishahouse,"Paul Wall is probably the first white rap star who doesn't feel the need to talk about his race. No white rapper has ever managed to reach any level of fame without addressing his race, whether it be the Beastie Boys' downtown dorkatronix, House of Pain's Irish-pride chest-beating, Eminem's obsessive self-loathing, or Bubba Sparxxx's country-rap album. Even Vanilla Ice concocted an elaborately fake backstory and put the word ""Vanilla"" in his name. Not Paul Wall. If you never saw a picture of this guy, you'd have no idea that he's the only white guy in his video; you'd just know that he's a dude with a low, thick drawl who loves cars and diamonds. A large part of Paul's success comes from his sheer implausibility-- he's a goofy guy with a fratboy goatee who went to college and then made his name designing platinum grills, and he rolls with an underground, provincial rap crew who became tremendously famous once MTV realized that Houston has this whole long-standing self-contained rap culture. None of this general weirdness (except the Houston stuff) actually comes through in Paul's music, which is all straight unadulterated H-Town rap, with all the slow booming drums and woozy organs and dizzying clustered bleeps that come with the territory. One of the reasons that The People's Champ succeeds is that it's the first album from Houston's rap Renaissance that doesn't remotely compromise the region's aesthetic-- it's all hazy, narcotic trunk music. Of the album's 17 tracks, only one was made by out-of-town producers, and even that track (DJ Paul and Juicy J's ""I'm a Playa"") has a heavy, off-kilter stagger that sounds completely Texas. Salih Williams and Mr. Lee, who produced, respectively, Mike Jones' ""Still Tippin'"" and Slim Thug's ""Three Kings"", both make appearances, but the album really belongs to the previously unknown producer Grid Iron, whose handful of stormy, gliding tracks are consistently the best on the album. The record also boasts a number of ridiculously great guest appearances. One of the great things about Houston funk is that it forces out-of-town guests to conform to its aesthetics, so the album doesn't come off sounding like a patched-together collection of tracks. The R&B; singer Trey Songz' guest spot on ""Ridin' Dirty"" is all gorgeous silky swagger, and it greases the track just right, while Lil Wayne spits cold, hard gangsta contempt on ""March N' Step"". It's a tribute to Paul Wall that Kanye Wests's near-perfect ""Drive Slow"" doesn't sound out of place when it appears here. As for Paul himself, he's fine, nothing special. He's a better rapper than labelmate Mike Jones (notably absent here), but not as good a rapper as Slim Thug. (In fact, on the bonus screwed-and-chopped disc, Paul's slowed-down voice sounds almost exactly like Slim's normal voice, which is weird.) He sounds calm and matter-of-fact on top of these expert beats, and he truly loves to talk about diamonds: ""I've got a deep freezer up in my mouth and sno-cones up in my ear/ A ice tray up in my mouth, I'm looking something like a chandelier."" Wall can be awkward and goofy, but endearingly so, as on the entertainingly ridiculous loverman track ""Smooth Operator"": ""I got a way with compliments/ Girl, I'm sweeter than mints/ It'll be common sense to let the lovemaking commence."" So Wall is a good rapper, but not a great one. But then, this is 2005, and all a rapper needs to make a good album is enough great, complimentary beats and guest appearances to keep the whole thing interesting all the way through. Like Game's The Documentary, The People's Champ has all that stuff.","Hazy, narcotic trunk music from the soon-to-be-platinum Houston emcee.

Z,My Morning Jacket,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beccea9e61561daa7960/1:1/w_160/44d27d18.jpg,2005-10-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16943-z/,ATORed,"Here's an album that begs for vinyl, although not for the reason you might think. Certainly, My Morning Jacket's worn-in rock 'n' roll-- its starchy guitar riffs and Jim James' other-end-of-a-long-tunnel vocals-- seems tailor-made for the intimate crackle of a dusty turntable. But the concisely titled Z, the band's fourth full-length, needs to be flipped over: It has two distinct sides. Granted, most albums still rely on the two-sided format the same way most movies still rely on the three-act plot, adhering to it almost subconsciously. But I'm not entirely sure My Morning Jacket intended such a dramatic difference between these two half Zs. As Side One begins, the presence of producer John Leckie (of Radiohead, Stone Roses, and, er, Kula Shaker fame) is immediately evident. ""Wordless Chorus"" launches Z with a hardscrabble sound that recalls their earlier material, suggesting that the brighter production and looser, jambandier approach of It Still Moveswas a slight detour. There are more keyboards on these songs, courtesy of new member Bo Koster, and more confident experimentation-- a little reggae, a little r&b, even a little ambient. Defiantly flaunting their rural eccentricities, My Morning Jacket once again recall the earliest of early R.E.M., before you could understand Stipe's mumbling, back when the Georgia foursome defined themselves by claiming a birthright to kudzu-covered mythology. It's not really My Morning Jacket's sound that suggests this comparison, but their willingness to let the music retain its mystery despite the risk of seeming obscure or evasive. So Z abandons the Skynyrdisms of It Still Moves, but that album's lessons remain intact: Compared to those on previous albums, these tracks have more guitar crunch and tighter song structures. Even single ""Off the Record"", with its driving reggae rhythms and James' lively performance, foregoes a dueling-guitar climax in favor of an unraveling outro that sounds like Air noir. ""Wordless Chorus"" hinges on just what its title suggests: Jim James singing aaahs and ohhhs between verses as the band rocks around him. It's as if the entire album, not just this song, could be stripped of literal meaning, as if everything My Morning Jacket needs to say can be communicated exclusively through sound. And it works, especially at the end of ""Wordless Chorus"", when James breaks into a rapturous r&b yowl that recalls the Passion of the Prince. But My Morning Jacket does have something to say. Zis a spiritual album-- or at least Side One is-- with references to religion and a few barely veiled allusions to Jesus Christ himself. ""Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young,"" James sings on ""Gideon"", and guess who the bouncy ""What a Wonderful Man"" is about. Here's a hint: ""He was leading us through the dark/ He was saying that love goes on."" Even that title itself suggests an omega to some unknown alpha-- sex or death or both. These hints at larger meanings infuse the songs with a weird sense of questing adventure, as if the band is revealing its secrets only to present even more riddles. Side Two, however, loses much of the strange steam that fuels Side One, struggling to find its momentum and bringing the album back to reality with pedestrian problems like pacing. Following ""Off the Record"", ""Into the Woods"" breaks that spell, making everything that comes after it sound a little pale and less immediate. A dark-carnival organ sets the sideshow stage for James to sing about burning kittens and babies in blenders, and the overly literal production inserts a me-oww and a wahhh into the mix, Spike Jones-style. It sounds markedly better when the band comes in halfway through, but the song still dawdles to a conclusion. As if to apologize for ""Into the Woods"", ""Anytime"" is straightforward rock, enlivened by a pogoing guitar riff and James singing himself ragged. Disregarding its low-lying bass and piano lines, ""Lay Low"" rises to a blandly grandstanding jam as if on autopilot, but ""Knot Comes Loose"" ambles along on Koster's fluttering piano rhythms. Fortunately, Z ends with the intense, simmering ""Dondante"". Backed only by a casually insistent rhythm section and a barely-there guitar, James sings as if in ecstasy, before the song explodes unexpectedly into a big, desperate chorus that sounds quintessentially My Morning Jacket. Then the song simply fades out-- but extremely slowly-- into several seconds of still silence. I like to think that the vinyl edition would loop that silence like Sgt. Pepper's, posing an answer to the album's question: What comes after Z?",,7.6,
Nympho,Armand Van Helden,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91e13d19756521397f2/1:1/w_160/d317de31.jpg,2005-10-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8411-nympho/,Ultra,"The first time I heard ""Hear My Name"", I laughed with sheer glee, hitting repeat on the car CD player over and over again, totally overjoyed. It's a gorgeously perfect disco-fluff diamond, a lighter-than-air swoop through pop history, a mindless scream of ecstacy, and it ended up at number two on my singles ballot last year. Too bad it's the only good song on Nympho, Armand Van Helden's disco-punk move. If this seems like a step-behind attempt at blatant trend-humping (which it is), it's also not entirely a bad idea; why shouldn't a top house producer be able to do this shit right? But no. Van Helden's idea of disco-punk consists of layering crunching overproduced metal guitar over weak little basslines and dinky cowbells, then hiring someone to gurgle meaningless sexed-up bullshit over the top. Four of Nympho's 13 songs are collaborations with Virgin Killer whose rawked-up Rapture-biting yawp is unbelievably tiresome and obnoxious. On ""Come Play with Me"", a ridiculously fake-sexy Cr\x8Fme Blush coos about falling in love with a DJ and doesn't even come close to selling ridiculous lines like ""He broke my heart in a limousine/ I was tired of the scene."" Even ""Jenny"", Van Helden's second collaboration with ""Hear My Name"" vocalists Spalding Rockwell, is a sad attempt at rocking out, the singers pathetically failing at getting all gothy and snarley over a turgid metallic bassline. When people are making fun of coked-out NYC hipsters, this is what they're talking about. When Van Helden comes up with a decent idea, he runs it into the ground hard. The first time he lays a cheesed-out 70s rock vocal sample over chugging house drums, it's mildly sweeping and glamorous. By the fourth time, it's clear that he doesn't have any more tricks to pull out. And by the time we get to the final track of the album, where Tim Holden says a bunch of echoey poetry-slam stuff over a lumbering, ungainly riff for six and a half minutes, it's clear that ""Hear My Name"" deserved a much better album.","Famed house producer's latest LP tries to live up to the thrill of last year's ""Hear My Name"" single.

I've Visited the Island of Jocks and Jazz,The Hospitals,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c185c0084474cd0c335c/1:1/w_160/9160a133.gif,2005-10-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4024-ive-visited-the-island-of-jocks-and-jazz/,Load,"The Hospitals' sophomore album I've Visited the Island of Jocks and Jazz is their first for Load, following a self-titled 2003 debut on In the Red. Albeit brief, that label lineage might tell savvy listeners all they need to know about the Portland group's depraved roots-noise mayhem. You could also track down their recent 12"" on the Yakisakana imprint on which they cover the Who, the Kinks, and Harry Pussy with equally fond but irreverent abuse. Put more plainly, the Hospitals bring the chaotic trash-rock of acts like the Country Teasers or Cheater Slicks to an inevitable-- if not exactly logical-- conclusion, creating a willfully primitive, atonal scree whose flash is that of a string of firecrackers: sharp, immediate, and short-lasting. Since their debut, the Hospitals have grown from a two-piece to a three-piece, with dual guitarists Ned Meiners and Rob Enbom joining drummer/vocalist Adam Stonehouse. This expansion has, if anything, resulted in a further degeneration of the band's sound. Whereas many of the songs on the debut maintained, or at least alluded to, standard garage-punk structures, most tracks here are deconstructed, with heavily reverbed vocals and serrated chords flying haphazardly past in fiery chunks. Unlike obvious precursors like Harry Pussy or Sightings, however, the Hospitals appear to have little ambition to drive these raucous exercises anywhere beyond their initial skin-deep assaultive shock. The guitars on tracks like ""Olympic Ghost"" and ""She's Not There"" feature some vicious Bad Moon Rising tones that'll carry innate appeal for a certain segment of the garage/noise audience, and others like ""Moving/Shaking"" or ""Airplanes There"" actually contain rudimentary melodic hooks. Across it all, Stonehouse strikes a curious presence, providing most tracks with surprisingly straightforward rhythms while submitting his tortured vocals and shiftless lyrical observations to an ocean of distorted effects. His work is at its most effective on the album's more experimental cuts like ""Problems"", which reaches depths of almost Jandek-like imprecision, or the aggressive dissonance of ""Be"", the only track here that surpasses the three-minute mark. Elsewhere, however, the Hospitals seem stubbornly intent on blurring their abstractions into sheer crude apathy. ""I Had a Crummy Shift"" wastes its promising title on an aimless 30-second slur, while ""Rich People"" contains a pointless goof on the familiar ballpark ""Go team go!"" ascending riff. Thankfully, this is a group that values brevity, and the majority the album's several one-dimensional non-starters (""Art Project"", ""Bands"", ""Jocks and Jazz"") won't cost you more than a minute or two. This is a small, welcome courtesy from a band who don't otherwise seem to take listener satisfaction into much account at all.","Portland, Oregon band moves to Load for its sophomore album.

Welsh Rare Beat,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a856b1335d7bf1699261/1:1/w_160/dd418656.gif,2005-10-05 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2100-welsh-rare-beat/,Finders Keepers,"Little by little, overlooked musical purlieus are opening their borders to new visitors. For more than three decades, a vast, hazy expanse of almost-famous rock has been synonymous with the term Nuggets; now, in addition to Children of Nuggets, we've got handy synopses of Afropop, baile funk, Brazilian post-punk, and a little something the Boston Globe recently mistyped ""reggaetron,"" plus a worldwide, web-like thing where most of it can (shh) still be had for free. On Welsh Rare Beat, Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys and DJs Andy Votel and Dom Thomas map out the largely uncharted world of 1970s Welsh rock. It's a surprisingly diverse place. Welsh Rare Beat culls together 25, ahem, nuggets released by still-extant Welsh indie label Sain (which means, simply, ""sound""). Stylistically the songs traverse from fuzzy garage-psych to eminently sampleable grooves, druidic ballads, eerie folk and-- on Huw Jones' ""Dwr"", Sain's first single, which laments the 1965 flooding of Wales' Tryweryn Valley to create a reservoir for Liverpool-- even tabla. The catch: As with Rhys's recent solo album, the lyrics are all in Welsh. Fortunately, Rhys provides ample liner notes for historical context. You think I learned that Tryweryn Valley shit at Pitchfork camp? The disc is laden with finds. The standout is Meic Stevens, frequently labeled the ""Welsh Bob Dylan,"" who turns in the joyous acoustic la-la-las of ""Y Brawd Houdini"" (""The Brother Houdini"") and the darker, funkier psych-folk jam ""Y Crwydryn A Mi"". Another Welsh icon, Heather Jones, makes two appearances: First Edition-style psych trades off with undistorted, almost-twee arpeggios on ""Nos Ddu"", while the ""Sweet Home Alabama"" lead guitar intro of ""Penrhyn Gwyn"" gives way to feather-pillow piano and a delicate country-ish vocal. The bands Bran and Y Tebot Piws (""The Purple Teapot"") also each make multiple welcome appearances, favoring a garage-psych bent, and the latter's cheerfully bizarre staccato foot-stomper ""Mae Rhywyn Wedi Dwyn Fy Nhrwyn"" (""Someone's Stole My Nose"") was apparently sampled by DJ Cashmoney. It's been a while since Wales was deemed the next Seattle (my condolences, Montreal). Welsh Rare Beat establishes that talented Welsh bands like Catatonia, Gorky's Zygotic Minci, SFA, and even grr Manic Street Preachers hardly emerged from a vacuum. For that matter, neither did fellow Cymru son Tom Jones. While not track-for-track jawdropping-- Eward H. Dalis's ""Calan Gaeaf"" bites the Doors' ""Twentieth Century Fox"" riff hard-- it's charming, eccentric, and decidedly endearing, like the artists it inspired. The late Titch Gwilym's fiery, Hendrix-style instrumental rendition of Welsh national anthem ""Hen Wlad Fy Nhadua"" is a final, apt example of an alternate universe whose discovery by non-Welsh listeners has been overdue.","Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys helps map the largely uncharted world of 1970s Welsh rock on this 25-track compilation.

Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon,John Lennon,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd4ea9e61561daa7581/1:1/w_160/922cb34e.jpg,2005-10-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4733-working-class-hero-the-definitive-lennon/,Capitol,"The legend of John Lennon, stripped bare of its romantic and willfully misinformed tales of idealism and near-religious fervor for ""changing the world,"" is mostly a lot of short stories about a stubborn, quick-witted domestic hero. Working class? That's debatable, as is much of Lennon's life for everyone save his widow and second son-- but then all good stories have an air of mystery about them. If I were more cynical, I'd point out that one person's mystery is another's propaganda, but ultimately, Lennon is going to be remembered for songs, not his personal life. Of course his personal life was his songs; to a fault, Lennon wrote about what he knew, however skewed by bitterness, confusion, regret, braggadocio, or even peace and love. Consequently, it's difficult to hear Lennon's post-Beatles music beyond the frame of whatever commotion was going on in his world at the time. Be it bed-ins for peace, trouble with Immigration, various political rants, relationship highs and woes, or his undying love of old rock and roll, Lennon was as partial as the most insular blogger-- and with no pretense of linking his sources. But then, he was probably smarter than anyone he knew (again, save Yoko Ono), and you can hardly blame a generation of spiritual hangers-on for letting his idiosyncrasies and tantrums run rampant. He wasn't the first punk; he wasn't ever really a hippie; he wasn't a poet, exactly, and he was barely a guitarist. He was a middle-class boomer with a short fuse, overtly provocative social and political ideals, but who was uncut for anything besides making music. Lennon's music, as a window into his life, is serviceable. As pop, it's immediately distinctive, if frustrating and inconsistent. As something in lieu of new Beatles albums, it's mostly disappointing. But as Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon makes abundantly clear over the span of two CDs, it was also a pretty amazing document of a mature artist going through the same shit as everyone else does. No, I don't recall asking for another Lennon comp, but as I get older, and we all get further from the circumstances that made him an icon, I'm reminded that his insight into growing up and getting on with life (and any number of distractions) was as keen as anyone's. Collections like this generally serve to rewrite history more often than give representative pictures of reality, but even Lennon's best moments are rife with contradiction and awkward expression. The good news is that Working Class Hero really does include most of his best stuff: ""Imagine"", ""Instant Karma"", ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", and ""Give Peace a Chance"" are obligated to any Lennon best-of, but Ono and Capitol were pretty spot-on by including ace stuff like ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Jealous Guy"", ""#9 Dream"" and a fantastic ""Real Love"" demo-- not to mention most of Plastic Ono Band. In truth, had this set also included the acerbic, Paul-hating ""How Do You Sleep?"" from Imagine, I could've recommended it over any of his solo records save POB. Yet again, Lennon is inconsistent to the end. As for rarities, beyond ""Real Love"", there is a live version of ""Come Together"" (wherein Lennon warns the crowd they may know more of the words than he does-- and then proves it), but Working Class Hero is supposed to be ""definitive,"" not all-inclusive. The Double Fantasy-era songs-- ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", ""Watching the Wheels"", ""Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)"", ""Woman"", ""Losing You"", and the Milk and Honey single ""Nobody Told Me""-- stand out from the rest as being a bit slick and out of steam, though in all fairness, also seem far less bitter than, say, ""Mind Games"". Again, it's all part of the legend that comes crumbling down when you actually listen to the songs-- his ""greatest hits"" suggest a guy who, while overcoming some of his darkest demons, was still a long way from being comfortable with himself even as he was living in the lap of luxury. The buttoned-up, proto-adult-contemporary sheen of Double Fantasy seems like a big slap in the face to real, live marital friction-- certainly about as far a cry as one could get from the uber-stark performances on ""God"" or ""Working Class Hero"". Pundits might argue that as Lennon matured as an artist, he felt less need to be musically confrontational. I would argue back that I'm a long way from relating to adult contemporary sheen. As a collection, Working Class Hero succeeds: The single-disc Lennon Legend always seemed reductive to me, and there's no way I need the four discs of solo Lennon available on the Anthology box set. Better still, this really does give me most of the stuff I'd want to put in my Lennon mp3 folder, and at this point, that's about as good a recommendation as I can give a compilation-- at least until the next one comes around in a couple of years. And what was that about instant karma...","Two-disc, 38-track compilation claims to be the ""definitive Lennon"" collection.

City Lights Volume 1.5,Nicolay,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b987eb335119a49ec7d5/1:1/w_160/4cdcd888.gif,2005-10-04 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5920-city-lights-volume-15/,BBE,"You can get away with murder just by calling it ""uninteresting."" See: The omnibus of crit on instrumental hip-hop. Pitchfork's own Jess Harvell laid it down, though. While conceding no other genre has ""forced us to sit through more un-reconstituted dreck than rap-less rap,"" he gives credit where it's due (in this case to Dabrye's Instrmntl): ""The one good thing about wallpaper is that it's just thereÉignorability is part of the deal."" So the review writes itself. But, interested in what the parsing of an artistic process can reveal, I try to be optimistic. City Lights Volume 1.5 puts us behind the boards of Dutch producer Nicolay, who helmed last year's most fortuitous hook-up-- that unbearably sensuous Foreign Exchange record. An interesting spot, 'cause Connected miraculously eschewed the desert island its emcee, Little Brother's Phonte, steered it straight for: blundering backpack innocuousness. Was it an illogical, disproportionate synergy, or were Nicolay's watercolor-light compositions that good? Does vox-stripped City Lights reveal the elusive, indwelling spirit of a talented producer's beats? Results are inconclusive. For one, Nic's beats are weaker, which confounds the experiment. This set offers nothing as luminous as the french horn-gilt ""Let's Move"" or ""Be Alright""'s blush-hued synths. But take care not to give the purple-sand beat-making shores of Foreign Exchange's intercontinental entente too much credit. For all Phonte's unmoving prattle on Connected, his verses did provide a crucial texture. The album's single holler-able refrain was a bated ""Let's Move""; otherwise, voice was cornstarch, a cooked-in thickener. Lacking that unifier, City Lights feels incomplete-- yes, even for rap-less rap. And thinness is the genre's death knell; it stifles listeners looking for an immersive opiate spell. Sameyness that doesn't even hold up as drapery? Sounds like ""meh"" personified. Nic's a savvy dude, howevs. He counterbalances our ears' inclination to drift with some jarringly offset kicks. Nothing too bold, mind you, lest it ruffle his fine-knit haberdashery. But ""Intro"" (which incidentally sports tactful backgrounded voices) sways on a rushed snare feel, flamming the simple changes. Details like that are missed on the boringly syncopated ""Fantastic"" and the hopelessly listless ""Indian Summer"". Throughout the latter, undulating vibes await their cup of coffee, but the skipper benches his top prospects, losing with groovin' hand percussion and fusty flutes. It'd be interesting if City Lights threw us a bone-- a vocal track, just one!-- for comparison's sake. Many songs concede noncommittal spoken word outros, but their formulaic placement (always as a predictable, faded segue into the next track) is fruitless. Monotony is expected, risqué nice but not required; this thing's just too bleary-eyed to sustain itself, much less our generous half-attention.","New LP from the Dutch half of Foreign Exchange.

Blame It on the Youth,The Sun,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c2c0084474cd0c0a3b/1:1/w_160/404ed12c.gif,2005-10-04 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7833-blame-it-on-the-youth/,Warner Bros.,"Blame it on the Youth is not a CD. The bright red sticker on the front will tell you that instead it's The World's First DVD-only Album. No audio disc comes packaged with The Sun's debut album, only a DVD with videos for each of its 14 songs. You can rip .WAV files from the disc with the DVD-ROM drive of your computer, or purchase mp3s from iTunes or other digital vendors, but put it into your car or home stereo and all you'll hear is the faint whirr of useless plastic spinning in place. The band decided that a DualDisc or an audio/video package-- a route taken by artists as disparate as Super Furry Animals, Wire, and 50 Cent-- would be too costly. Admitting to leaking their record tp p2p networks five months before its release, their choice acknowledges and tacitly encourages file-sharing, while trying to give the consumer a package to get excited about. But aren't there a number of people who buy CDs, yet don't have DVD-ROM drives in their computer? And don't they download most of their music, legally or otherwise? The videos were reportedly put together on the cheap, using handheld cameras and pooling volunteers from Craigslist. Some are undeniably amateurish, but ""Justice"", ""Waiting on High"", or ""Valentine"" all feature competent lighting and editing production values. There's even some ingenuity to the racy shoot for ""Romantic Death"", which splices together grainy shots of men and women facing the camera while masturbating (from the shoulders up). ""2B4"" or ""We Try"" are a little less creative with their limited budget, and the animated collage for ""Taking the Lord's Name in Vein"", full of blunt political imagery, would have been better off with just straight performance shots. ""Lose Your Money"" is a continuous shot of a man sitting, staring at a mirror and a bottle of wine, while half-heartedly mouthing the song's lyrics in between sips of alcohol. He lights a cigarette and rubs his brow, then it ends suddenly with an inscrutable montage of color-saturated nature imagery. It's trite, self-involved, Film Production 101 fare-- yet I've had nights just like it, with songs plenty more embarrassing than the dirge-y ""Lose Your Money"". The director took a risk, and I can't deny my sentimental reaction. I wish I could say the same for the songs. Not that Blame it on the Youth lacks catchy melodies, or that they're aren't meticulous arrangements under the hooks. The band executes polite slices of pop like ""Justice"" and ""We Try"" with precision, but the moments of supposed catharsis-- the red-faced screaming through the third verse of ""Must be You"", or the flubbed guitar solo and thrashy finale of ""Say Goodbye""-- come off as forced. Even the borderline freakout ""Taking the Lords Name in Vein"" sounds rehearsed and mannered. Try as they might, the Sun just can't seem to sweat or get dirty on Blame it on the Youth. I'm not just reviewing a batch of songs here, I'm reviewing a DVD that a good section of the buying public can't even listen to without watching TV for an hour. While there's a broad palette of sounds and images to be found, their multi-pronged multimedia gamble just points toward my main complaint with Blame it on the Youth: The Sun want to master all the mediums, but they don't have much to say.","The world's first-ever DVD-only album.

Misty Medley,Kiss Me Deadly,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4dabf31b7dc7155cad/1:1/w_160/f394287e.gif,2005-10-04 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4602-misty-medley/,Alien8,"If the word ethereal did not exist, it would be necessary to invent it. Like so many other terms in our desperately comprehensive language-- unicorn, utopia, Kevin Federline-- it describes a concept that is essentially nonexistent. Ethereality is more of an absence than an entity, a lacuna in human understanding that encapsulates all things insubstantial and fleeting, intangible and delicate, ineffable and intuitively not-of-this-world. Certain sensations are impossible to explain without it, the diffuse frissons of post-rock (the dreamy, shoegazey '90s variety, not the modern conflated-with-math-rock stripe) ranking high among them. n Kiss Me Deadly's lusciously ethereal post-rock is leavened with stark contrasts--the tension between languorous shoegaze and kinetic shuffle beats, for instance--but the starkest one is between the band's pulpy name and their pristine music. Kiss Me Deadly is a Mickey Spillane book made into a 1955 film noir by director Robert Aldrich, and there's nothing less ethereal than the bleak, fatalistic archetypes of film noir; every face striped with the hard-edged shadows of moon-obscuring Venetian blinds. As Nitsuh Abebe pointed out in his recent Pitchfork article on '90s post-rock, ""early post-rock bands were constantly talking about the moon, with all of its usual connotations: Weightlessness, futurism, blank space, and serenity; dreamy, cerebral moods; and of course the beeps and hums of the old technology that first got people there."" As if to signal this affinity, Misty Medley's cover features a contour line drawing of a blank-eyed astronaut gazing past the moon and out of the frame, perhaps at shoes tied at the laces and drifting through space. Not content to recreate the cerebral palimpsests of Stereolab and Bark Psychosis, Kiss Me Deadly updates classic post-rock swoon with gentle dance rhythms and poppy, lucid song structures. The immediate grabber is Emily Elizabeth's breathy, helium-infused voice, which brims with more chirrups, squeaks, and indelible flourishes than anything this side of Life Without Buildings. As the gliding guitar melody of ""Dance 4"" finishes chiming out the national anthem of some lunar colony and settles into a fluid cadence, Elizabeth's stage whisper wafts into the mix, culminating in shrill screams that woozily bend into mellifluous vowels. On the lilting ""Dance 2"", she makes like a human slide-whistle, cooing and squealing about ""candy eyes"", and on the jittery ""Dance 3"", she sounds like a club-pop diva who wandered into Echo and the Bunnymen's practice space. If Elizabeth's voice is exquisitely odd, then Adam Poulin's serviceable croon is a welcome ballast. On ""Pop"", he rides the stuttering wave toward a grandiose chorus like an indie Bono; on ""Let's"", he hunkers down in sibilant percussion and a characteristic melody that pairs a dominant, simple guitar figure with a recessed, twitchy lead. The music's most striking quality is that of gliding, which requires equilibrium. Kiss Me Deadly, with their outré female and mundane male vocals, their coasting rhythms and anxious melodies, strikes a balance that holds Misty Medley easily, weightlessly aloft.","Kiss Me Deadly update classic post-rock swoon with gentle dance rhythms and poppy, lucid song structures.

The Witching Hour,Ladytron,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc70eb335119a49ecc7e/1:1/w_160/5651aac6.jpg,2005-10-04 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4635-the-witching-hour/,Ryko,"Even though the warm breath of October has made it easier (here in Toronto, anyway) to pretend we're still in July, the spell is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. From the browning leaves to the scarves in the windows of the downtown department stores, it's understood that we're just playing in injury time now, and that any prickly chill might signal autumn's speed trials on the way to another interminable winter. Beyond the first snowfall, I am not a finds-comfort-in-December kind of person, which is probably why my treasured winter albums mean a lot more to me than the summer ones. There's something to be said for all records that lend themselves to certain seasons; the really good ones have this strange ability to extrapolate themselves across time. When Björk's Vespertine came out in 2001, I knew it wasn't just going to be a record I listened to a lot that winter, but in every one after it. It's instant, like a mirror-in-mirror hallway, folding out into the future for God knows how long, always as much a mystery as it is a comfort. This year, for reasons I haven't figured out yet, I'm feeling like perhaps the good winter records are going to be even more important than usual. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, and the mirrors are getting smaller. Or maybe it's just going to be that much harder to fend off the creeping feeling of end days without the benefit of summer's attendant glories. I won't lie: I didn't expect this to be one of those records. In fact, with the exception of a handful of singles, the best of which still felt brittle and two-dimensional, I never cared much for Ladytron. Granted, the whole electroclash thing getting levied against them seemed kind of unfair (the takeaway: keyboard basslines and polygonal haircuts are a gateway drug to dumb press), but for a type of music that was supposed to be emblematic of, if not a stand-in for, mountains of cocaine, Ladytron always seemed kind of enfeebled, their glassy tick-tock a weak substitute for anything properly muscular. If they lacked the horsepower before, the year plus they spent touring behind 2002's Light & Magic put the meat on their bones. Despite being delayed for nearly a year thanks to the collapse of their UK label Telstar and the emergency room administration required for their still-dormant U.S. label Emperor Norton, The Witching Hour is the most urgent and immediate of their career. The earlier records were sort of toylike and plastic; this not only has a pulse, it has chilled blood in its veins. Every quantum leap record has a quantum leap single, and in this case, it's ""Destroy Everything You Touch"". With a charging chorus and shivery production that sounds as equally indebted to shoegaze as it does synthpop, this is probably the most confident and menacing thing they've ever done. Almost as good is ""International Dateline"", which marries a pogo punk rhythm and a post-punky guitar lead with a keening vocal hook. With nothing but a transparent wash of synths and a simple minor-key vocal melody, closer ""All the Way"" demonstrates that Ladytron's advancement owes as much to their songwriting as it does to their increased production prowess. And, for better or worse, the barely concealed cocaine metaphor of ""Sugar"" (""If I get the sugar, will you get me/ Something elusive and temporary"") proves they could go there if they wanted to. But perhaps the most surprising thing about The Witching Hour is how affecting it is. Beyond the crumbling synths and the uneasy washes of white noise are lyrics that move between sounding commanding and hopelessly lost; where vocalists Mira Aroyo and Helena Marnie once sang about things like movie theatres and Commodore computers from about four steps back from mic, they're right between your ears now, their lungs fighting with the wheezing synths for airspace. That's as good an illustration as any of how far they've come in these last three years: if Ladytron of old was a truckful of ice, this one's a winter storm, bundled up people and all.","London-based quartet's latest record is confident, menacing, and equally indebted to shoegaze and synthpop.

Extraordinary Machine [Jon Brion version] / Extraordinary Machine,Fiona Apple,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d65e6ef9596932004d/1:1/w_160/ba5552a7.jpg,2005-10-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11639-extraordinary-machine-jon-brion-version-extraordinary-machine/,mp3,"If you're particularly web savvy, you may have seen the previous version of this review up on the site before its replacement with the edition you're reading right now. Here's the story: I crafted the original to be my most ambitious yet-- epic in scope, embellished with the richest prose I could possibly summon. But alas, the powers that be were not, as they say, feeling it, and sent me back to the drawing board to craft a review less eccentric and more crowd-friendly. Or actually, maybe I had second thoughts about the original review myself, choosing to self-regulate and take a mulligan. I don't know, it's very confusing; but know that all this vacillation was never for publicity's sake, no, never that. So I can empathize with Fiona Apple, who has gone through a similarly arduous journey on the road to releasing her first album in six years. Earlier this year, Extraordinary Machine appeared destined for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot status, as the nearly-finished album Apple made with longtime collaborator Jon Brion was shelved, then surreptitiously leaked to the world's music thieves. But rather than graciously accepting a starring role in Fuck the Man Rock N' Roll Myth #67, Apple did a do-over, this time working with Mike Elizondo, best known as right-hand man to the good Dr. Dre. Unfortunately for Apple and Elizondo, that Brion version isn't going away quietly. And now, upon the release of the official retail version, it only makes sense to compare the two-- a sort of musical Pepsi challenge-- given that they share 11 of 12 songs. The differences are far from subtle: For all but two songs, the title track and ""Waltz (Better Than Fine)"", Elizondo overhauled the original takes-- or maybe underhauled is the more appropriate term in this case, given the addition-by-subtraction philosophy applied throughout. Apple is a songwriter who can turn every relationship hiccup into a calamitous tragedy, and Brion fittingly applied his production talents with the intent of blowing up her songs to 2.35:1 aspect ratio. On ""Not About Love"" and ""O' Sailor"", Brion scored Apple's compositions no less extravagantly than his soundtracking work for the indie-film elite, applying dollops of lush orchestration to place her piano and throwback vocals in an epic frame. Though the material wasn't always Apple's best-- ""Oh Well"" and ""Window"" in particular, sounding a bit through-the-motions-- the symphonic presentation kept it interesting and gave the LP a cohesive flavor. Elizondo's approach is more eclectic: Rather than applying copious amounts of strings, he employs bits of organ, backwards loops, and busier drumming to flesh out Fiona's sound. But the fleshing out is kept skeletal, so as not to distract from the central elements of Apple's voice and piano. Though the Brion version was likely unmastered, it's still striking how much the emphasis has shifted from a broader sound to Apple's contributions alone, like demos in reverse. You can also pour a 40 out for fallen countermelodies, as Elizondo hacks away Brion's embellishments upon ""Not About Love"" and ""Window"" in his efforts to keep the spotlight fixed solely on the star. Not to say that there aren't moments where Elizondo either improves or offers a valid alternative to the Brion takes, as ""Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song)"" remakes the routine ""Used to Love Him"" with twitchy synth-bass and ""Oh Well"" benefits from a stronger vocal take. The dreamy ""O' Sailor"", meanwhile, refuses to be ruined, though the new version knocks the original out of its cosmic moody-blue orbit by insultingly replacing actual strings with the synthesized variety. Not so tamper-proof are the triplets ""Red Red Red"" and ""Please Please Please"", the former losing most of its drama thanks to a dull ambient backdrop, the latter ironically softening its single-ready punch on what's supposed to be the more traditionally commercial album. The officially released version of Extraordinary Machine remains a decent-to-good album, one that showcases Apple's considerable vocal and key-pounding talents. In its new clothes, the album fits alongside her prior two albums, with only the slightly less consistent material bringing it down a peg. The shame of it all is that Apple, after six years of silence, could've made a more definitive, progressive statement rather than something familiar and similar-- and we've got the bootlegs to prove it.","

Smash,Jackson and His Computerband,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb54eb335119a49ec9f5/1:1/w_160/3569ce12.jpg,2005-10-03 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4363-smash/,Warp,"Jackson Fourgeaud doesn't write songs. He builds ridiculously elaborate toys that run on their own silicon-plated gears. Perhaps he starts with something very small, takes it apart, inserts tiny robots, let's them play around awhile until new parts spring up around the old ones. Jackson's melodies might have begun as everyday melodies, but after he's done tinkering, reassembling, and tinkering again, they sound like musical engines, designed not for ease of use but for speed and precision. If his songs were sold individually on store racks, only the richest kids would ever own them, and even then, they'd probably end up in a closet with the junior chemistry set and last year's iPod model. There are a lot of people who will tell you that these kinds of toys are pointless because of their exclusivity and built-in obsolescence. I'd agree that the shelf life of your average glitch-core, robo-pop CD is distressingly short, and wonder if I'll ever see the day when all of the technique that goes into this stuff ever actually produces something ""accessible"". But that's okay if it doesn't: Jackson's debut LP Smash, featuring a dubious ""Computer Band"", is interesting not so much for what it does, but for what it could have done. Two years ago, when he released ""Utopia"", Jackson briefly seemed like the next great hope for IDM, somehow finding a way to balance insanely detailed production with a hook that refused to dislodge itself from many of the electro-heads who heard it. This song had it all: enigmatic intro, expertly crafted beat, spooky background drones and otherworldly female vocal harmonies that even now make me stop what I'm doing to marvel. As Smash's opening track, it sets a pretty high bar for the rest of the record. Unfortunately, in the years since the song's first appearance, Jackson appears to have lost interest in creating tracks like this. Most of the rest of the album is far less ""pretty"" and far more ""impressive"". That is, it's hard to say he isn't progressing as an artist, but even harder to remember a lot of these tunes. The new single ""Rock On"" is an admirable stab at straightforward dance-oriented pop, perhaps the nerdy cousin of Daft Punk's ""Robot Rock"", but trades any melodic momentum for an almost constantly shifting rhythmic base. Snares turn into handclaps, drums fall in and out of the mix, the beat sounds like it's running backwards-- to which Jackson responds by singing wordless falsetto over the top. It's a dizzying experience, but one I'd argue takes a step-and-a-half back for every step-and-a-fourth it moves forward. ""Arpeggio"" is slightly more manageable, mostly due to the semi-consistent beat, and is in fact a pretty good take on Akufen-styled trickery. I might also mention Mouse on Mars, but where the German duo are experts at crafting melodies from the barest hint of actually melodic movement, Jackson usually lets his firework machinery handle things by itself-- there's little quarter given to listeners accustomed to being handed choruses on platters. However, there are signs of genius: ""Hard Tits"" lurches along with a deceptively simple piano figure, doubled by more wordless, heavily reverbed falsetto, that should put Moby out of business once and for all. The overall effect is angelic (similar to parts of ""Utopia"" in that respect), and suggests that he may yet produce music whose complexity not only doesn't overwhelm the vibe, it sends into the stratosphere. Of course, it's preceded by a goth-cinematic track narrated by a little girl (""TV Dogs""), and followed by strained-CPU glam (""Teen Beat Ocean""), so there probably isn't much danger of a crossover soon. And, really, that's fine with me, as is the video game powered ""Tropical Metal. Under all the layers of electronics and broken beats, this is pop: I can put up with haters telling me you can't dance to this stuff as long as Jackson keeps things interesting.","Jackson Fourgeaud doesn't write songs.

Spider Through the Fog,Ghost of Monkshood,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab65ea9e61561daa5d5a/1:1/w_160/4a70db6b.jpg,2005-10-03 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8980-spider-through-the-fog/,GMH,"In the Year of the Wolf (Bands), Ghost of Monkshood missed it by a hair: Monkshood is another name for aconite, aka wolfsbane. Aconite's a sedative, but also a poison, and hoo boy somebody stop me before I start constructing one of those specious metaphors linking a band's music to their (probably arbitrarily chosen) name. Nothing poisonous here anyway, unless you're fatally allergic to the kind of music that tends to hover in place instead of moving. Spider Through the Fog is tranquilizer-dosed phantom folk drifting bodiless through veils of mist, medleys of cloudy ambiance marshaled into improbable pop songs. On the microphone, they came to haze and amaze you: The murkier side of Animal Collective (that would be Panda Bear) after a Donovan binge, with snatches of Four Tet coming through the wall. Put a bunch of smarty-pantses together with a random assortment of instruments (besides the usual accoutrements, Ghost of Monkshood reached into the grab bag and found a banjo, a trumpet, a sax) and one of two things happens-- one, they subjugate craft to pretension and record an unlistenable mess that wants to be hailed as ambitious and challenging, placing the burden on the listener, like here, we recorded the thing, now you figure out how to enjoy it, and don't forget to be smart enough to get it. The other option is that the band makes sure they have actual songs and aren't just deconstructing thin air, like the aforementioned Animal Collective, Architecture in Helsinki, and yep, Ghost of Monkshood. Seventeen tracks is too many for, say, a rock album, which ultimately wants to propel you out of it and into the world, but it's just right for Ghost of Monkshood, whose music encourages staying inside it, and needs the extra time to work its gradual hypnosis. Spider Through the Fog immediately immerses you in a rich drone ricocheting between the right and left channels, establishing the limits of the echo chamber the album will ramify within. For the duration, Ghost of Monkshood enliven pillowy analog static and acoustic guitars with flower-child vocals and flickers of vivid detail: There's the weirdly rickety guitar solo on ""I Take It""; the ghost of G-funk whistling through ""Traces of the Cave""; the gnarled cassette-tape-suicide on ""Goddess Hand""; the sudden funk capping ""In the Night""; the busted music box on ""Capsized"". The sweet and the sinister get equal time on Spider Through the Snow, often becoming so blurred as to be indistinguishable, and its to Ghost of Monkshood's credit that the album still comes off as an affable, pleasant surprise, not an endurance test.""","In the Year of the Wolf (Bands), Ghost of Monkshood missed it by a hair: Monkshood is another name for ...

You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having,Atmosphere,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1395e6ef95969320136/1:1/w_160/3c95a391.jpg,2005-10-03 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/344-you-cant-imagine-how-much-fun-were-having/,Rhymesayers,"You can't imagine how much fun I wasn't having listening to this album. Atmosphere's MC, Slug, he of the tortured romantic life, intriguing racial politics (half-white, half-black), and ""aw-shucks, he's rapping, wait, stop shouting"" rhyme style, is getting boring fast. Let us count the ways: Reverential past-peddling. Degenerative flow. Lame Mohawk. Weak follow-up to the breakthrough album. All the ducks, lined up in a row. At the risk of sounding like one of those kids who watches ""The O.C."", Atmosphere was always for those moments when a woman ripped your heart out, then punched you in the neck. I won't say ""the hip-hop Death Cab,"" but you get the picture. Nothing wrong with the raw sadness and fury Slug conjured, but you weren't exactly throwin' your sets up for Minneapolis' finest. I always put that Lucy Ford record underneath the M.O.P. album in the crate. So the abandonment of that form here, that ""guilty pleasure,"" hurts my feelings. Mr. Heartache, where you at? In its place, I guess, is the sap of another tree: Nostalgia. Nothing can illuminate the pomp and circumstance of You Can't Imagine better than this couplet from ""Watch Out"": ""When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J/ But then he started makin' records for the girls and shit/ So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away."" Uh, what? Forgetting that's just a wack rhyme for a moment, anyone who's been to an Atmosphere concert surely knows the kind of estrogen jam they can be. Even worse than the desertion, though, is that this record lacks any growth or good humor. Which is a shame because their previous album, Seven's Travels, while flawed, started to find a balance (wink) between the political leanings that have crept into Slug's raps with his wounded-puppy raps. This is not to say the album's a mess. Like Blackalicious' recent The Craft, it displays a real hard-earned competency, something a decade of recording together will get you. But the lyrics lack transcendence or resonance. Conversely, producer Ant's production is full and springy. His growth has never been in question, exploding with complicated chops and orchestrations on every album. Whether flipping operettas on ""Say Hey There"" or dropping pianos from five floors up on ""Musical Chairs"" he's got sundry abilities. The songs here are melded beautifully, making the eventual instrumental wax a must-cop. In all honesty, I never understood why Ant wasn't lacing dudes like Freeway and Young Buck years ago. He could do it. There are exceptions as the album moves, like ""Angelface"" which quivers with panging guitars and (gasp) a politically snarky jab at Uncle Sam, masked as the kind of love letter this dude used to kill something lovely five years ago. ""Pour Me Another"" oozes barfly grease. And ""Little Man"" is pretty and loopy. On it Slug says ""I'm over 30, can't maintain relations/ All these women wanna hurt me/ And I just don't have the patience."" This is not something you hear much on a rap record. It's refreshing. Of course, if you want to be a dick about it, Juelz Santana murdered the same sample used on ""Little Man"" on the first Diplomats album back in 2003 without sacrificing his diary entry. Pity. On their fifth proper, the attempts to merge Slug's emotionally aware, sneering theatrics with the sort of nostalgia-4-cheap malarkey that passes for ""conscious"" hip-hop these days is a crashing failure. Like Edan and Little Brother's reminiscent melancholy from this year, listening to Slug disregard hip-hop's sonic development is like stuffing a chloroform-soaked Shelltoe in your mouth. Don't you know we rockin' Bapes these days, mang?","Emo hip-hop group displays a sense of hard-earned competency.

"""Singers""",Mount Eerie,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c55feb335119a49ed9c0/1:1/w_160/61292eb7.gif,2005-10-03 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5597-singers/,P.W. Elverum & SunP.W. Elverum & Sun,"Phil Elverum's latest experiment: audibility. Don't bother cranking up the headphones; ""Singers"" will find you. And in short order, no less. Opener ""Let's Get Out of the Romance"" dallies on a slow-sloshing guitar line and Elverum's wilted vox before the arrival of a towering chorale. That turn-- all three seconds of it-- resonates beyond anything on No Flashlight, Mt. Eerie's first studio album, released in August. Why the turnabout? ""Singers"" is from the same mold as its forebear: a bleary, lo-fi aesthetic, organic, unadorned instrumentation, and the usual surfeit of opaque first-person narration. Even its premise-- Microphones/Mount Eerie oldies recast in ""sing-along"" versions-- promises business as usual. But ""Singers"" succeeds, for one, because you can actually hear what the fuck is going on. Flashlight was sinus infection listening-- all bass swell and muffled percussion burbling beneath tattered acoustic overlay. Melodies sank in a swamp of clipped, bleeding microphones. On ""Singers"", Eerie separates its milk from its mush; vocals streak through the interstices of piano and stringed instruments, no chafing. It can't hurt, either, that the album features Elverum's best recent cuts. ""Ut Oh! It's Mourning Time Again"" does ditty with rare gestural lightness, the chorus scrambling for the guitar solo like a '66 T-Bird rattling toward a precipice. You hear a round of shrill, echoic howls rise up from all areas of the musical field, lending the song a disquieting but oddly jubilant hollowness. It's a wonderfully spontaneous moment that almost justifies the album's precious gag. Such macabre humor isn't a fresh cut from Elverum, but, gussied up with a tidy instrumental and enough team spirit to power Mt. Eerie to a Great Outdoor Games medal, its seldom been as sharp as on ""I Can't Believe You Actually Died"", whose titular campfire refrain flickers out in hysterical laughter. Throughout ""Singers"", spontaneous off-mic sounds give the illusion of a space much larger than Elverum's studio digs. But what does the album achieve that's so different from any basic lo-fi recording? Does Elverum have a special ability to render his persona into aesthetic effects? If so, why has he most recently used it to make tedious, cynical music, knowingly devoid of the humanist warmth of The Glow, pt. II and It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water? Wrist-slitter ""Human"" and van Gogh tribute ""I Cut My Hands Off"" get by on profound-seeming vox. Elverum's chants of ""hu-man...hu-man..."" on the former are a clever condensation of the songwriter's lyrical corpus, which has never strayed far from topics of nature, body, and spirit. But for the truly mantric, check ""Do Not Be Afraid"" and ""So Your Big Black Cloud Will Come"", both crushingly heavy dirges with concise (you're looking at 'em) lyric sheets. Dude's gotta know, though, not to make every line the denouement; save some of those catch-phrases for the dramatic moment. So it's tough to give Elverum's lyrics laboratory attention when they're so pushy. Like William Carlos Williams without the punch line, his words are whittled down to deep salience then removed from any discernible context and looped ad infinitum. What sounds meaningful reads like jabberwocky. But at least ""Singers"" will help Microphones devotees-- feeling a bit maligned lately-- start listening again.","Phil Elverum's second new album in two months recasts his tracks in ""sing-along"" versions.

Broken Social Scene,Broken Social Scene,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b09d034d5c69bf2eaa/1:1/w_160/e631aed9.jpg,2005-10-03 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/955-broken-social-scene/,Arts & Crafts,"Expectations are a bitch. Ask J.D. Salinger. Or George Lucas. Or Kevin Shields. After Broken Social Scene stumbled out of the incestuous Toronto alt-rock scene with Feel Good Lost-- a postrumental refrigerator-hum stiff of a debut-- few would have guessed this group of scruffed-up bohos had a veritable classic lurking in their collective consciousness. Then, ignited by a rabid internet reception, You Forgot It in People gracefully went boom, and lots of people remembered why they loved indie rock-- the shambling ecstasy, the pitch-perfect experimentation, the unabashed heart-on-sleeveness of it all. Now, with file-sharers queuing up like mad and pre-orders bumping them to Amazon Top 50 status, the collective reacts to the furor by expanding and magnifying; another six members join the brood for its self-titled third full-length, and the band's once-refined studio sound is blown up into a pixilated blur of blood-gush guitars and squall-of-sound production that's somehow meticulously unhinged. This exercise in excess makes the ambitious You Forgot It in People seem positively understated by comparison. De facto band leader Kevin Drew recently told Pitchfork that Broken Social Scene producer (and NYPD punching bag) David Newfeld ""got addicted to the idea of trying to top YFIIP."" He added: ""His massage therapist says he might die in 10 years unless he changes his lifestyle."" It's Newfeld's risky mixing and uncanny knack for coalescing myriad instruments and voices into a propulsive whole that defines this new album. Whereas You Forgot It in People was exacting and refined-- each cymbal crash snipped to perfection, each underlying string melody was spare and to-the-point-- Broken Social Scene is wily and flowing. Just consider each disc's mood-setting introduction: YFIIP's ""Capture the Flag"" is muted and tasteful; BSS's ""Our Faces Split the Coast in Half"" gets out of bed, trips, falls down, does a sloppy summersault, and gets back up no worse for the wear. The contrasting titles alone-- one direct, one Dali-esque-- speak volumes. But, however symbolic, ""Faces"" is only a casual stretch, with follower ""Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Half)"" serving as the album's first true workout. ""Ibi"" breaks in with a woozy, five-alarm guitar-- a warning call for the track's off-key surrealism and pile-on distortion. Like the shaky ascent of a homemade rocketship, the song constantly teeters on cataclysmic oblivion; shards of chords slip away and grind against each other as the track embarks. Buried between the static and the void, mumbled vocals are folded in before the brass enters and elevates the endeavor to fist-pumping, room-on-fire glory. That track's garbled vocals and lyrical ambiguity are filtered throughout this record. With no accompanying lyric sheet, most of the album's highly interpretable words not only provide fans with a time-wasting message-board guessing game but add another layer of atmospheric haze to the group's already out-there takes on sex, politics, and that whole indies-vs.-majors thing. On the wispy, faux-idyllic ""Major Label Debut"", the chorus could be ""I'm all hooked up"" or ""I'm all fucked up,"" but either meaning snidely puts down the rockstar clichés Broken Social Scene are determined to avoid. Anyone's who's been to a Broken Social Scene show over the past few years probably knows ""Major Label Debut"" as a rollicking, open hi-hat dust storm. But here, that version is relegated to an accompanying EP (otherwise filled with mostly expendable outtakes and instrumentals) while the album version is slowed down and fogged up-- and decidedly less single-worthy. Another live favorite and possible crossover contender, ""Superconnected"", is still catchy on record, but Newfeld's all-at-once, in-between-vox production subverts any chance at overt smashdom. Such insular stubbornness leads to Broken Social Scene's few overly self-indulgent moments, when their lack of inhibitions turns from charming to faintly annoying. Their tendency to jam out-- not entirely surprising given bassist Brendan Canning's striking Trey Anastasio-meets-Elmo look-- turn the seven-minute ""Bandwitch"" into an aimless jumble. Along with the similarly too-free-spirited ""Windsurfing Nation"" and ""Handjobs for the Holidays"", such unchecked exorbitance damages the album's hard-won continuity. But a few regrettable overreachings are somewhat inevitable when a band tries to top a record as strong as YFIIP. Looser and slightly kinkier, Broken Social Scene indulges in the pop eccentricities and keen melodic ears of more than a dozen Canadians who take willful pride in their ability to lock together into one solid unit and make good on the sum of their unique individual talents. With its doomsday provocation of a title, the epic Springsteenian endcap ""It's All Gonna Break"" bursts forth with enough ideas to keep a lesser band productive for years. The song ecstatically encapsulates Broken Social Scene's heightened ambitions and flawed Icarus journeys, conflating into a bold, brash love-in infatuated with its own bumps and bruises.

The Best of the Beta Band,The Beta Band,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2895e6ef95969320432/1:1/w_160/9a61ff85.jpg,2005-10-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/672-the-best-of-the-beta-band/,Astralwerks,"If they loved the Beta Band so much, why did people give them so much shit while they were still alive? Their early development was so startling-- from pleasant late 90s stoner-hop to a startling mix of folk, kraut, and acid house in less than six months-- that we just assumed they could go anywhere. Then they released an album that did go anywhere, and they got castigated for it. Then they toned down the shit-talking and liberties-taking and accentuated the beat-science and hippie-gentleness, and they got castigated for it. Then they released an album of pleasant, conventional indie rock and couldn't even get castigated. They were as exhausted as we were and broke up. It's pretty clear they weren't the assholes here: There's not a single band in the past year with the balls-- or lack of sense, your call-- to release a debut album as overgrown with ideas (not always good ones, mind you) as The Beta Band. And in 2001, what Hot Shots II was offering-- guitars meet Timbaland, to be reductive-- was pretty much all many of us wanted from a rock band. A best-of released in the aftermath of an ignominious break-up always feels a little less radiant than a best-of from a band who went out on a high note. The Best of the Beta Band is a funny beast. Collecting singles, it should ideally give haters what they always wanted: All the band's styles in one place. Unfortunately, it has the probably unintended effect of shaving off the shag. Missing an obnoxious piece of audience baiting like ""The Beta Band Rap"" or the cuckoo twentysomething-crisis of ""Round the Bend"" means you're not getting the Betas as they were. Sequenced chronologically, The Best of the Beta Band features a whopping five tracks from their last album, Heroes to Zeros. So it's missing a few choice cuts, though exactly which ones are up for debate. They could have made room for live-staple ""The House Song"", the mournful, rain-soaked ""Push It Out"", or the playful ""Brokenupadingdong"". The only thing it's incontrovertibly lacking is ""Sequinsizer"", where over a punchy groove they weave lonely brass, Eno-ish textures, and frontman Steve Mason's voice cut-up like a flu-ridden diva in a Todd Edwards house production. ""Dry the Rain"" starts us off, and if the Betas had stopped there, they'd be languishing in the 99-cent import CD single bins with Gomez and Travis. ""She's the One"" stretches the strums of the Champion Versions EP across a full 70mm print, pumping the mix full of Technicolor detail. It's not saying much except ""I'm in love,"" but it does so with such swirling, ringing conviction that even professional cynics like me have used it as a soundtrack to going head over heels. ""Dr. Baker"" starts out hungover in bed watching drips of piano against the window, but, by the second verse, a lost calliope has burst into the bedroom. ""It's Not Too Beautiful"" is a Beatles tune with Q-bert (the video game sprite, not the turntablist) on production before a sample from John Barry's score for ""The Black Hole"" confuses the axis entirely. ""To You Alone"" is where Mason's interest in the plastic r&b; triplets that were everywhere at the turn of the last century first took hold. It's very rare to find a band both open to what's going on in the wider world and willing to give it their own spin (in this case, Faust-like spiraling drum swirls and kosmiche guitar) without coming off either cynical or clueless. It was a sound they would embrace fully on Hot Shots II, and the tracks that represent that album here, such as ""Squares"", are ankle-deep hip-hop grooves and disorienting texturally. ""Gone"", also from Hot Shots, sends a spare piano line wending through a humid fog of reverb. Mason sounds positively forlorn. It is a ridiculous crime that the sparkling psych/dancehall admixture ""Broke"", presented here in its single mix, cuts out before the extended groove (the best part-- complete with ""Sleng Teng"" bassline!) kicks in. ""Assessment"" brazenly recycles the riff from U2's ""I Will Follow"". Outright theft wears poorly on them, though the blazing horns at the end make up for it somewhat. ""Easy"" gets by on a croaking organ/harpsichord groove and not much else. ""Wonderful"" is the weakest thing here, a barely there ambi-ballad. (""Troubles"" isn't much better. The Betas' hippie-speak can go beyond charming to, you know, hippie-ish.) But ""Simple"" buffered a particularly lonely two-month stretch in my life, and though it skirts banality, a chorus of ""the trouble with your own thing is you end up on your own"" is both deeply affecting and a metaphor for the entire Beta Band project. If live discs are the definition of ""for fans only,"" then a live disc included with a best-of is the definition of pointlessness. Yet live was clearly where the Betas gave everyone what they wanted. People could sing along together to ""Dry the Rain"". A melodramatic song like ""It's Not Too Beautiful"" could be extended past the breaking point. On record, the Hot Shots II songs can often provoke a response like the one I heard from a co-worker: ""Wow, I haven't heard trip-hop in forever."" Here they add a freak-out guitar solo to ""Squares"", all to the good. The drum circle workouts of ""Inner Meet Me"" and ""The House Song"" make sense in commune with an audience. ""Dr. Baker"" becomes a cruising rock track. Judging by this year's King Biscuit Time single, Mason hasn't totally abandoned the ""beats + indie"" formula, and good on him. Maybe he just needs a little time to regroup-- get his head together in the country, as it were. If the Betas promise to release another record, we can promise to afford them the respect they deserve. Even if it's just that vaguely apocryphal second disc of mountaintop THC jamz that was supposed to be appended to The Beta Band. They were always so cute when stoned.","Compilation regrettably smoothes the rough edges off of the much-missed Scottish quartet's career.

Cannery Hours,The Occasion,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46069fc7814a47cd884/1:1/w_160/4878fde1.gif,2005-10-02 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6117-cannery-hours/,Say Hey,"The Occasion make languid and unpushful music, cloaked in fussy textures and not particularly eager to please. This means two things: That their New York City provenance will raise eyebrows, and that this review will be full of awkward synesthetic similes (A.S.S. in future mentions). Trouble begins with the first audible event on the Cannery Hours's opener, ""So Far"". It is an undulating (A.S.S. #1) tape loop reminiscent of the bassy throb that inaugurates Murmur. Instead of being abruptly subsumed by more traditional percussion, however, the loop is the sole propulsive engine of the song. This is the first pleasant surprise in a series. Further listening reveals a band luxuriating in murk (A.S.S. #2). Most songs hatch in thin air (A.S.S. #3) and build to soupy (A.S.S. #4) density while meditating on a recurrent chord progression. This is the sound of a democratic, clearly collaborative entity: Three of the members rotate on lead-singer duty, while background vocals remind one of-- dare I say-- the Arcade Fire, not to mention Barrett-era Pink Floyd. One member, Sara Shaw, is credited exclusively with tape loops, Martin Swope-style, and her contribution to the band's sound is hard to overestimate. The songs show every sign of being constructed from the groove up, but they're songs nonetheless, not lava-lamp blobs or invisible-movie soundtracks; whether the band like it or not (I'm guessing the label does), there are some pop pleasures to be gleaned from Cannery Hours, especially the shorter numbers like ""Back in Town"". There's only one way for a record like this to come to a close, however-- with a 10-minute gigantojam-- and the Occasion abide: witness the lumbering, eye-rollingly titled ""The Maiden"". Coming back to the ""OMG they're from NYC"" ledes the Occasion seem to occasion, I'd like to volunteer that there is, by now, a distinctive New York scene devoted to defiantly genre-less mid-fi psychedelia. Oneida's rather brilliant ""The Wedding"" is the best-known example so far, but bands like Grizzly Bear and, to some extent, the Occasion's Say Hey labelmates Inouk are certainly helping carve out this niche. The sound of their records seems rooted in rejection of dry ProTools perfectionism but isn't mannered or reactionary enough to see the hissy boombox stuff as an alternative. Instead, they deal in subtle dislocation: the electronics wheeze; the loops grate lightly against the drums, which are recorded and mixed clean but without flamboyance; there's a refreshing wobble and ebb of analog drift throughout.","NYC band makes languid and unpushful music, cloaked in fussy textures and not particularly eager to please.

Who sings like a Pound Puppy while agreeing to push your bail bonds when cash was tight? Who compresses the entirety of this year's Fannypack record into one 2:35 track? Who exudes so much offhand sass she might strip the chrome off your bumper if she parked her ""gifted, all-natural, and bursting the seams"" keester on it? Robyn Carlsson gets confused with Robin S of ""Show Me Love"" fame. (Not helped by the fact that she also had a U.S. top 10 called ""Show Me Love."") But she's best known for ""Do You Know (What It Takes)"", which also went top 10 over here in that late-90s moment when anything with a fake r&b; beat and a sunshine attitude charted as a welcome relief from, like, the Toadies and stuff. She's disappeared from our radar for the past eight years-- as Euro pop stars tend to do-- but Robyn is as stupidly ebullient as any record released this year. ""You wanna rumble in my jungle?/ I'll take you on/ You wanna rumble in space/ I'll put my laser on stun/ And on the North Pole/ I'll ice you, son."" Uh-oh! Over canned synbeats and zaps, she struts her stuff, castigating silly boys who think they're playing in her weight class and generally acting like the shit. ""Who's That Girl"" sez ""no, no, no"" like Destiny's Child to institutionalized sexism-- or something. ""Handle Me"" tells bar star douchebags with flipped polo shirt collars that she's too much. Okay, so ""Robot Boy"" is pretty much insufferable, a swerve too sickly for Radio Disney and kinda creepy when you factor in the songs about coming on tongues. (Those nails she's sporting on the cover don't look designed for wiping tears and mending broken hearts.) But ""Be Mine"", which I blathered on about in the tracks section a few weeks ago, is a disarming heartbreaker perfectly poised between twee and tuff, like if Pete Wiggs and Bob Stanley and the Neptunes got trapped in Jeff Goldblum's Fly pods. ""Crash and Burn Girl"" is kiddie disco (I like to imagine the party wreck she's addressing is Lindsay Lohan, but yr mileage may vary) with added early Madonna quotes. ""Konichiwa Bitches"" suffers from a bad Dave Chappelle joke title (not that it'll matter in 10 years), but redeemed by the fact that it's 2:35 of boasting so compressed you'll rewind it three or four times in a row. ""Bum Like You"" isn't a ballad, really, but it is slow and acoustic guitar driven. It's also nice to know that someone out there was willing to rewrite ""No Scrubs"" with a modicum of humanity granted to the scrubs in question. Robyn is already being called ""this year's Annie,"" which is horseshit because she actually emotes. And unlike the aforementioned Fannypack, she's got a range beyond ""ripping off L'Trimm."" Her pop fun is a bit knowing-- she's 26 after all. But trust the Swedes. They know what they're doing with this sort of thing. Plus it's all over in 35 minutes.

Here's the thing, though: I'm not convinced these boys make albums. Not like that, and not in those terms. Sometimes, when we call an act a ""singles band,"" we mean something cruel and obvious-- that their album tracks just aren't very good. But with Franz Ferdinand, we mean something kinder: that their whole project, their whole system of stylish poses and cocksure guitar stomps, just happens to work better in discrete, surprising, three-minute blasts. It's damned generous of them, really. And like Duran Duran-- the band whose sound these guys spent parts of their first album hybridizing with some vintage Josef K and Monochrome Set post-punk stuff-- chances are they'll continue making solid LPs from which we mostly just cherish and remember the hits. That's the report from You Could Have It So Much Better, which does a lot to lock in that M.O. As it turns out, Franz Ferdinand, like many an effective singles band, are immensely more lovable when they're on top of the world. Casual, insouciant greatness is kind of their thing, and these cocky kids seem to have known it from Day One-- just consider ""Take Me Out"", where they spend half a minute pretending to sound like the Strokes before pulping their way down into something much better. And then consider ""Do You Want To"", the lead single from this album. Give these guys the Mercury Prize, and do they sit down fretting about making some kind of serious statement? No, they come back with a big ridiculous stomper, a song whose hooks get so happily ballroom-glam you'd almost think they stole them from the Sweet or the Bay City Rollers-- the kind of song most bands wouldn't be able to pull off without telegraphing a whole lot of irony and embarrassment. Couple that with a video in which they dress up in matching outfits, pull faces, and goof, A Hard Day's Night-style, through a gallery full of modern art touchstones, and there's your treat: These guys are evidently having a ball, and they sound good doing it. And they go on sounding like that across the length of this album: gleefully unselfconscious, increasingly glammy and trad-rock, and almost disturbingly amped-up, to the point where most of these songs feel like they're spewing confetti all over themselves, whether you feel like helping or not. Some stretches are packed with so many hooks and effortless swings and shifts and yowls that you might start to ignore them entirely. People will probably tell you that makes this less of a good album-- a record full of energetic twists and flourishes that don't quite make up for a lack of real, memorable songs. They'll tell you that the interesting things here are the boys' new attempts at bringing down the tempo-- tracks like ""Walk Away"", ""Eleanor Put Your Boots on"", and ""Fade Together"", where the band cribs jaunty moves from Revolver, Paul McCartney, and the Turtles. The trick is to cede the idea that Franz Ferdinand are meant to deliver the cohesive, moving, traditional Statement Albums their debut may have misled listeners to expect. Some people-- earnest people, like Bloc Party, Sufjan Stevens, and the Arcade Fire-- will go on trying to fill that niche. Franz Ferdinand, though, aren't going to do that, and good on them: We can only hope they'll go on offering us cheeky, energetic surprises. Someday, maybe, they'll score a single as perfect as Pulp's ""Common People"", or pop up with a discoid treat as frothy as Blur's ""Girls and Boys"", but don't count on these guys to keep you supplied with serious close-to-the-heart-on-your-sleeve indie touchstones. Judging by You Could Have It So Much Better, these style-conscious art kids are content to be a fine, entertaining pop band instead.

Somebody's Miracle,Liz Phair,by: Amy Phillips,Managing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04dc0084474cd0bfb32/1:1/w_160/e6a05e85.jpg,2005-10-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6256-somebodys-miracle/,Capitol,"Now this is a terrible Liz Phair record. Somebody's Miracle is mostly generic pap that any number of next-big-has-beens could have cranked out, a useless piece of plastic poking a pointy heel in the eye of the carcass of the artist Liz once was. Sound familiar? I know I may be in the minority 'round these parts, but I actually like Liz's 2003 self-titled trainwreck. Yes, it's desperate and confused and comes on to you like the mom in American Pie. For all of those reasons, I find it quite fascinating and entertaining, not to mention provocative. I mean, we're still talking about it, aren't we? When was the last time you got into an argument over Stephan Mathieu & Ekkehard Ehlers' Heroin, which Pitchfork reviewed the same day as Liz Phair, and gave an 8.6? Isn't that why we fell in love with Liz in the first place, because she made us angry and uncomfortable? In hindsight, the 0.0 bomb was wasted on that album, because it's much better than Somebody's Miracle. The chief complaint about Liz Phair seemed to be that its rockers were sticky-sweet Matrix-pop at its best-- cheesy, tacky, glamorous, and yes, radio- and MTV-friendly. People complain that ""Extraordinary"" and ""Why Can't I"" are Avril rip-offs, but now that we all agree ""Since U Been Gone"" is a masterpiece, maybe a few more people should rip off Avril. Rather than weather the storm and stick to her guns, Phair eschews her pop fix completely for Somebody's Miracle, an album that is ""adult"" in the worst sense of the word-- the sense that gets ""-alternative"" or ""-contemporary"" tacked onto it by radio programmers. It's not so much ""mature"" as is it safe, nice, settled down. These songs are perfectly content to get up every morning, go to work, come home, eat dinner, watch the news, have 10-minute missionary-position sex, and then fall asleep. Opener ""Leap of Innocence"" swaddles the chorus melody of Liz's own ""Polyester Bride"" (from her underrated 1998 album whitechocolatespaceegg) in wide, bright heartland-rock chords, as Liz moons over The One That Got Away. Blah, whatever! And why does it sound so weird? The disconnect between her flat voice (the pitch corrector has clearly been set aside-- she's completely off-key) and the shiny production gives the song the feel of an unfinished overdub, something to be scrapped or cleaned up later. Although, at least it's not boring, which is more than can be said for most of the 13 songs that follow. The title track, ""Count on My Love"", and lead single ""Everything to Me"" soak up Sheryl Crow's sun, get lost in John Mayer's wonderland, and oh, how they remind me of Nickelback. In fact, so do most of the tracks stinking up the back end of this tedious, over-long calamity. Of course, not everything on Somebody's Miracle sucks like Maroon 5; a few songs suck in other ways. ""Wind and the Mountain"" starts out promising, with appealingly vulnerable verses about, appropriately, not living up to expectations, but by the chorus it's a self-help serenade, all we're-gonna-get-you-through-this Dr. Phil crap. ""Stars and Planets"" seems to be making some sort of statement about the Big, Bad Music Industry, but the Teletubbies-happy chorus (""We all shine! Shine! Shine! We all shine! Shine! Shine!"") and overzealous bounciness of the rhythm make it the kind of earworm that sends people screaming to Wolf Eyes. ""Table for One"" is a trite, oversimplified acoustic lament from the perspective of a doomed alcoholic. Only someone armed with the pipes of Trisha Yearwood and an artillery of Nashville session musicians could save it. There are two decent songs on Somebody's Miracle, and that's why you aren't staring at double zeros once again. On ""Got My Own Thing"", Liz purrs in her best tomboy about how she don't need no stinking true love, since the guy she's got is doing just fine for now. ""Why I Lie"", meanwhile, reaches back to Phair's old slippery sense of melody and penchant for self-deprecation. ""And if you ask me why I hurt you/ I don't understand it/ I can't help myself/ It's a special combination/ Of predatory instinct/ And simple ill will,"" she sings over a clip-clopping beat and Stones riff, sounding not the least bit apologetic but, frankly, kinda bored. Ahh, there's the Liz we know and love. Just as naysayers were quick to blame the Matrix for Liz Phair, it would be all too easy to point fingers at Phair's collaborators on Somebody's Miracle-- namely producers John Alagia and John Shanks. Between them, they've twiddled knobs for the Dave Matthews Band, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Michelle Branch, and Celine Dion, which explains pretty much everything. On the other hand, Shanks has worked with Hilary Duff, Pink, Ashlee Simpson, and Kelly Clarkson, and co-wrote ""Come Clean"", ""Pieces of Me"", and ""La La"", so Phair could certainly have chosen to continue experimenting with teen-pop. Either way, she took the helm, and as such, the successes and failures of Somebody's Miracle fall squarely on her shoulders. Would she really want it any other way?","La Liz delivers the follow-up to that album.

The Craft,Blackalicious,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fdb1335d7bf1698601/1:1/w_160/76527ac1.jpg,2005-09-29 06:01:40,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/788-the-craft/,Anti-,"Blackalicious' Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab are among the most diligent and reverent technicians in hip-hop, so it feels oddly appropriate that their third album, The Craft, should bear such a workmanlike title. Painstakingly detail-oriented and lyrically dense, the record is another labor of love that puts as much emphasis on the labor as on the love. With an ambitious expanse that falls somewhere between the eclectic sprawl of 2000's Nia and the more-streamlined funk of 2002's Blazing Arrow, it appears as if every square inch of The Craft has been fussed over to such an extent that Blackalicious's calculated risks and controlled experiments can sometimes make the album seem more science project than artwork. Following the release of Blazing Arrow, both group members spent time with other projects-- Gift of Gab with his 2004 solo album 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up and Xcel with his underappreciated Lateef and the Chief collaboration Maroons: Ambush. And evidently this time apart allowed the two to approach their partnership rejuvenated and ready for some serious woodshedding, as they reportedly recorded dozens of tracks before pruning down to these relatively lean 14 songs. Despite this strenuous editing process, however, The Craft can remain a frustratingly uneven listen. Brimming with confidence, the duo plows through ideas both familiar and novel. Fans of the group's previous work-- and of Solesides/Quannum-related material in general-- will find treats within The Craft's many folds, but its irregular terrain will likely prevent consensus about which tracks represent the peaks and which the troughs. The most noteworthy change to Blackalicious' sound is a pronounced increase of live instrumentation. On paper, the extensive use of live drums, guitars, and strings might seem a nod toward creating more conventional songs, but in practice this blend has unquestionably resulted in some of the weirdest tracks of the group's career. Xcel integrates the instruments so seamlessly into his samples that it's often difficult to pinpoint what's what. On opener ""World of Vibrations"" the mix segues abruptly from the song's daffy, almost Joe Meek-like chorus into a sultry breakdown of rippling guitars, impassioned female vocals, and shimmering dub effects; it's an interlude as beguiling as it is unexpected. Much more straightforward is ""Powers"", the album's effervescent first single. With its bouncy layers of new-wave guitars, strange Manfred Mann keyboards, and Go! Team exclamations, this track resembles an outtake from a failed hip-hop Broadway revue, but is salvaged by Gift's adroit melodic work on the verses and Xcel's rubber-limbed production. Even better are adventurous tracks like ""Side to Side"", which features Lateef and Pigeon John exchanging verses with Gift of Gab over a loony, oboe-fed sway, the unrelenting pound of ""Egosonic War Drums"", or the bracing prison reform drama ""The Fall and Rise of Elliott Brown"", which is fortified by Xcel's well-doctored horn samples. Throughout the album Gift of Gab showcases his still-astonishing verbal dexterity and enunciation, chiseling every syllable into the pavement despite rarely breaking from a full sprint. But if you've tired of his ""I still think abstract/ Stay metaphysical/ And challenge what is really real"" act in the past, it's unlikely that anything here will alter your viewpoint, particularly on tracks like ""Rhythm Sticks"" where he resorts to the tired riff of spelling out the name Blackalicious. (""...A is for the absolute that dwells everywhere you can't see/ C is for creating..."") Such missteps aside, Gabby is at his most persuasive when he slows down a bit and lets the game come to him, especially on autobiographical numbers like ""My Pen & Pad"" or the set-closing title track. And though these numbers must overcome some threadbare ""This ain't music, it's my life"" clichés, there can be little doubting the emotional heft in Gift's delivery, or in the inspired connections that Blackalicious manage to discover whenever they're hard at work together.","Blackalicious' Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab are among the most diligent and reverent technicians in hip-hop, so it feels ...

Drums of Death,DJ Spooky,by: Cory D.

A prominent figure in turntablism for the past decade, Spooky has remixed Nick Cave, Metallica, and a score of others, and he's worked with a wide range of hip-hop and indie rock's biggest stars. For his 2004 release Celestial Mechanix: The Blue Series Mastermix, he fused jazz and hip-hop, remixing tracks from selections from Thirsy Ear's Blue Series. Now, a year later, he's teamed up with thrash metal legend Dave Lombardo, most famous for his work with Slayer, but also skin-pounder for Fantômas, Grip, Inc., and one-time member of Testament. As if that pair wasn't odd enough, also along for the ride are Public Enemy mouth-piece Chuck D, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, and Meat Beat Manifesto's Jack Dangers. The result is the appropriately titled Drums of Death. The tracks are pretty evenly split between frenetic, drum-heavy instrumentals and guitar-driven hip-hop. The hip-hop songs are the stronger, especially ""Assisted Suicide"", which features Dälek. The three other hip-hop tracks here are Public Enemy remakes: ""Brother's Gonna Work it Out"", ""B-Side Wins Again"", and ""Public Enemy #1"", all of which are beefed up by Lombardo's mechanical throb and crunchy guitar work from Reid and Dangers. The slice-and-dice beats and throbbing guitar are a perfect match for Chuck D's seething vocal delivery. Luckily, DJ Spooky's spinning and Dangers' production keep all of these tracks from coming off like so many failed, meatheaded rap-metal hybrids. These are hip-hop songs first and foremost, with the rock elements used along with samples and keyboards to create texture beneath the lyrical attack. Unfortunately, the instrumentals aren't as interesting. Lombardo's drumming is always impressive, but on many of these tracks it's the only thing that stands out. Of the instrumentals, ""Kultur Krieg"" and ""Terra Nulius (Cyborg Rebellion on Colony Planet Zyklon 15)"" are generic thrash metal with tinny production. The jazzier, illbient tracks, such as ""Metatron"" and ""A Darker Shade of Bleak"" are a little more inspired, but they still don't offer quite enough creative ideas to push them to the front. The exception is ""Incipit Zarathustra"", which mixes Lombardo's aforementioned lightening-fast drumming with Spooky's equally impressive turntable skills, mixing in samples from, among other things, the Beastie Boys and Atari games. It's the perfect outlet for both of their talents, which they're both clearly overflowing with. As one of the more compelling songs in this collection, ""Incipit Zarathustra"" just goes to show how unfortunate it is that Drums of Death is so uneven.","Thirsty Ear teams the famed turntabalist with the thrash metal legend.

Hearts and Unicorns,Giant Drag,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02713d197565213b9dc/1:1/w_160/43ddc2d4.jpg,2005-09-29 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3685-hearts-and-unicorns/,Kickball,"Hearts and Unicorns kicks off with ""Kevin Is Gay"", which opens with some indecipherable gibberish and guitars that squawk a simple theme over layers of bent, distorted chords. It quickly drops away to just Annie Hardy's innocent voice over a simple drumbeat and sunny synthesizer bass. From this, you probably wouldn't guess that Giant Drag has just two members, singer and guitarist Hardy and drummer Micah Calabrese. Calabrese's left hand should get a third of the credit, triggering the programmed bass that somehow becomes the glue holding together ""Kevin Is Gay"" and later the kiss-off anthem ""This Isn't it"", among others. ""Kevin Is Gay"" ends with Hardy singing the melody with ""meow"" in place of every word, and segues into multi-tracked studio banter where she demands with uncontainable glee to hear the song played back. ""Cordial Invitation"", reprised from the group's consistently overdriven Lemona EP, gains a fleshed-out arrangement, recast here as demure acoustic pop. ""This Isn't It"" is another track recycled from Lemona, as is ""yflmd"". ""This Isn't It"" is just as inviting as the earlier version, giving the spotlight to Hardy's voice and Micah's hand during the verses, until three distinct chords in the chorus deflate all the momentum, as if Hardy's stopping the car to give someone an added awkward goodbye from the driver's window. ""yflmd"" retains a snaky guitar line that sounds like To Bring You My Love-era PJ Harvey, with come-hither lyrics that get a little creepier with context. (The song title is an acronym for ""you fuck like my dad."") What's more memorable than the psycho promiscuity the title suggests is Hardy's countermelody on guitar that takes us to the chorus (""You're just like my father."") ""High Friends in Places"" treads the same ground-- man-eating promises over cantankerous swells of guitar (""One wasn't clean/ One wasn't man enough for me""). There's moments when they vary the approach, adding horns to the swaying rhythm of ""Blunt Picket Fence"" and creeping electronic tones to ""Smashing"". By and large, the two-man formula is stretched for all its worth, though the bouncy ""You're Full of Shit (Check Out My Sweet Riffs)"" or the strong vocals of ""My Dick Sux"" transcend Giant Drag's simple formula. All these silly song titles and nearly frightening studio patter scratch the surface of something, the way the snippets on a record like Surfer Rosa add another layer of inscrutability, but monochromatic guitars overwhelm the album and mute the few moments of quirk. The two gems here are the bored kiss-off ""This Isn't it"" and the effortless ""Slayer"", which closes the album. Hardy softly murmurs the melody, sliding through a riff with a pristine guitar tone over the gentle 4/4 thump of the bass drum, adding the barest back-up harmony. Yes, Giant Drag sound good with the guitars cranked to 11, but they sound great when they're barely trying. If you make it through the maniacal bonus tracks, you might get the feeling I did: That Hardy could be a far more interesting frontperson than Hearts and Unicorns lets on.","Annie Hardy and Micah Calabrese move between snaky guitar lines and demure pop.

Dimanche à Bamako,Amadou & Mariam,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1cb5e6ef95969320288/1:1/w_160/53ce6b36.gif,2005-09-29 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/485-dimanche-a-bamako/,Nonesuch,"Hollywood doesn't make movies as good as the life story of Amadou & Mariam. Their musical careers stretch back decades-- Amadou Bagayoko played guitar for the legendary Ambassadeurs du Motel de Bamako beginning in the late 1960s. At Bamako's Institute for Young Blind People, Bagoyoko met Mariam Doumbia, and the pair forged two parallel partnerships, one in marriage and the other in music. Their parents approved of neither. They began their recording career in the 1980s the way so many other African artists have-- traveling hundreds of miles to Abidjan in Cote D'Ivoire, which until recently was one of the cultural and economic centers of Francophone West Africa, to make cassettes and perform. Within a decade, they were playing in Europe and cutting all kinds of new influences into their sound, from Cuban son and horn-spiked funk to reggae and Delta blues, and Western labels were giving them the compilation treatment. Now, with Dimanche à Bamako, the blind couple from Mali seems well-poised to make a huge splash, though it's likely that the mainstream attention they get in the rest of the world will far outpace what they get in the U.S. For Dimanche, the duo and their backing band brought in Manu Chao, a world music superstar famous just about everywhere outside of the United States, and the dividend is a varied, bright, and charming album. While Chao's beat-conscious eclecticism makes this Amadou & Mariam's most accessible album (to Western ears, that is), it also comes at the expense of some of the organic directness of their past records. Still, that's more than made up for by the incredible style salad they've dreamed up, one which Chao's airy production and love of field recordings holds together quite well. In fact, you might hear something like this album driving through the streets of Bamako with the windows open, the way snatches of street noise, sirens, and voices drift through. Both Amadou & Mariam sing (Chao's voice is everywhere as well), and they're both restrained, smooth vocalists, especially compared to some of Mali's biggest stars, Salif Keita and Mory Kante. As such, this probably makes them more suited to chunky r&b; and Western pop than their countrymen, and indeed, were it sung in English, Amadou's thrilling descending chorus on ""Politic Amagni"" sounds like something you might hear blasting from a car at an American stoplight. As pleasing as his voice is, Amadou's real talent is reserved for the guitar, an instrument he plays with supple, liquid skill. He reels off roiling lines and droning desert blues with graceful dexterity, reflecting influences as wide-ranging as Bembeya Jazz's Sekou Diabate, Robert Johnson, and Saharan guitar and oud music. Opener ""M'bife"" proceeds in two parts, the first being the proper song, featuring Mariam's starkly unadorned voice over male harmonies, percussion and strummed guitar; the second is a buoyant, thumping instrumental that intertwines rhythmic guitar interplay with tumbling balafon, a West African marimba with a slightly sharper sound than the marimbas we're used to. Single ""Coulibaly"" layers male/female harmonies and bluesy guitar licks over a dense foundation of swirling rhythm guitars and clattering percussion, while ""La Realite"" brims with siren samples and off-beat organ. ""La Fete au Vilage"" sounds ancient by comparison with its modal guitar and traded verses, though granted it's unlikely that tablas could have made it into the background of a Malian folk song prior to the last few decades. Mariam flirts briefly with rap on ""Camions Sauvages"", coming halfway between it and Indian rhythm exercises, and the track highlights how important raw kinetic energy is to the album with an insistent beat framed by Amadou's slow, surf-y strumming. The album spends a full hour swinging from strength to strength, and by the time it's over, it's clear that it would be a crime if it didn't rocket Amadou & Mariam straight to stardom. It's a shame that in the U.S. it's likely to be smooshed into the world music ghetto, because it demonstrates as well as any recent release just how meaningless the world music tag is-- if anything, it proves that music is perfectly capable of wandering right past borders and across oceans and teaching us that for all of our perceived differences, our cultures and art are compatible. Amadou & Mariam clearly see no boundaries.","Blind husband-and-wife duo from Mali team with world music star Manu Chao to create a varied, bright, and charming album.

Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era 1976-1996,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d49d034d5c69bf38c7/1:1/w_160/538864d9.gif,2005-09-29 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1972-children-of-nuggets-original-artyfacts-from-the-second-psychedelic-era-1976-1996/,Rhino,"There is no real definition of a Nugget, which is the first thing you have to realize when approaching Rhino's ongoing series of ridiculously awesome four-disc compendiums of rock 'n' roll from the fringe of the commercial spectrum. The first two boxes concentrated on the late 1960s, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a signature sound on them, as they embody everything from gut-punch garage rock, blue-eyed soul, and raging proto-punk to frilly gnomes-and-faeries whimsy, mod toughness, and acid-induced nightmares. No, if anything, a Nugget is simply a song that got overlooked in its own era and deserves a second look. The compilation titles talk about psychedelic eras, but they seem to delight in muddying up the very definition of psychedelia, and the third volume of the series, Children of Nuggets, is only too happy to make the terminology harder to pin down. First, calling 1976-1996 the ""Second Psychedelic Era"" is pretty dubious; this music was mostly off the radar during that span and so many other things were happening that it's nearly impossible to wring any kind of narrative out of it. If there's one thing all of these bands had in common, it's that each one of them was responsible for at least one great song. The liner notes try to hold them together like this: ""One characteristic that binds all the groups compiled here was that they looked back to and drew inspiration from earlier times,"" but that merely describes every single recording artist who ever lived, even if a lot of them didn't do it consciously. So what we wind up with after all the semantic wrangling is 100 mostly unknown songs by a bunch of artists most people have never heard of, which is, of course, the appeal of the whole enterprise to begin with. It's not going out on a limb to say that by far the most famous song here is ""There She Goes"" by the La's, but no artist is especially famous. The biggest are XTC in their Dukes of Stratosphear guise, the Posies, Primal Scream, the Soft Boys, Flamin' Groovies, Teenage Fanclub, and the Smithereens, some of which are known for music that doesn't fit the overall tone of this set. The Dukes of Stratosphear kick off Disc One with ""Vanishing Girl"", which is the exact opening I would have chosen had I compiled this box. The twinkling guitar intro sets an immediate otherworldly tone, and everything else about this song is perfect: the tight harmonies, melodic bassline, huge chorus. It's been one of my favorite songs since I first heard it years ago, and it's one of the best here. The Dukes-- essentially a front for XTC to indulge their 60s fetish-- are one of several acts well worth exploring beyond their contributions here (they also have a song on Disc Two). There are too many revelatory tracks here to run them all down, but I'll quickly hit a few highlights. The Nashville Ramblers' ""The Trains"" is a gorgeous, heartbreaking piece of melody-drenched guitar pop with a sense of longing and rich darkness that would have done the Zombies proud. The Spongetones give the Hollies a run for it with ""(My Girl) Maryanne"", a big harmony-stuffed song that unfortunately missed the British Invasion boat by a couple of decades. Representing the rougher, more garage-oriented side of things are the Last, whose ""L.A. Explosion"" is a raw guitar grind, and Laika & the Cosmonauts, who turn in a crazy psychedelic surf medley of the themes from Vertigo and Psycho. The only genuine scene represented here is L.A.'s mid-80s Paisley Underground, a loose cluster of jangly, melodic bands that drew their inspiration from the Byrds and other American folk-rock. Rain Parade stills sounds vulnerable and heavenly all these years later, while Steve Wynn's Dream Syndicate checks in with ""Tell Me When It's Over"", a song that lets the guitars loose in a house of reverb. The Three O'Clock, Green on Red, and the Bangles (then known as the Bangs) all check in as well, leaving Mazzy Star precursor Opal as the only major scene participant missing in action (apparently, this was due to licensing issues). Another scene that would have been worth exploring is New Zealand's, which centered around the Flying Nun label, but that country only gets one track, in the Chills' ""Pink Frost"". Granted, it's a fantastic track, full of slinky drums and ominous guitars, but New Zealand's South Island was a Nuggets paradise in the 80s, and it's a shame the compilers couldn't get more. If I can geek a little further on the missing material tip, it's telling that compiler Alec Palau laments the absence of the Television Personalities in the liners, because they really ought to be here. My other wishlist bands include 14 Iced Bears, Chameleons, and Cleaners From Venus, but it's tough to fault the final track list too much. I'm also curious if Rhino plans a set that visits the years 1970-1975, which have been left unexplored by all three volumes, outside of a couple stray tracks. They could start with Crabby Appleton's ""Go Back"", end with Spirit's ""Fresh Garbage"", and there'd be plenty to fill the middle with. There's no real guarantee that people who loved the first two Nuggets sets will love this one as well-- the era that Lenny Kaye originally documented had a certain spirit of madcap adventure and experimentation, whereas the rebellion here is often tempered by reverence. Still, it's not a bad bet, and fans of Elephant 6 and modern indie rockers like the Shins and Mazarin will find plenty to love here, while the compilers cite the Strokes and the Hives as ""Grandchildren of Nuggets"". I'd say it's worth the price for any serious of rock 'n' roll nerd in general, lavished as it is with typically extensive liners, pages upon pages of photos and album art, and informative track notes. Who knows where the Nuggets franchise will go next? As long as they keep unearthing mind-blowing songs like the Jigsaw Seen's ""My Name Is Torn"", I'll be listening.","4xCD Rhino box sets celebrates ""Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era 1976-1996"".

Prairie Wind,Neil Young,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaedc0084474cd0c12a2/1:1/w_160/f7c6da79.jpg,2005-09-28 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8855-prairie-wind/,Reprise,"Neil Young turns 60 in November. In the last year he's survived an aneurysm and a greatest hits album. So why hasn't the man started to sound old? Sure, his voice quavers on some of the high notes on his ambitious new album, Prairie Wind, but he sounds remarkably preserved, showing the same age and wear he's shown for years: That voice-- alternately gentle and strident, tender and outraged-- has held up surprisingly well, gaining gritty authority with age. His few cracks and wrinkles just reinforce the sense of wistful nostalgia that suffuses Prairie Wind as well as almost all his other folk-rock albums since Harvest Moon, if not since Harvest. Young has made this sort of no-surprises reliability a virtue. He long ago set the templates for his music, and while he's known for his itchy restlessness, late in his career he doesn't stray from that comfortable sound. The scope of his albums grows immodestly-- his previous, Greendale, was even accompanied by a film-- but his music, whether time-capsule folk like Prairie Wind or ragged-glory rock, remains the same size, exhibiting his confidence that a small voice can address enormous issues on a personal level. That constancy can be consoling, despite the themes of loss that haunts his songs. There's something proudly old-fashioned about Prairie Wind, specifically in its simple visions of America, as in the title track's central image of a farmer's wife hanging laundry in the backyard. Even the title itself hopes for the possibility of more American frontiers, a new home on the range instead of a McMansion in the 'burbs. In other words, Young's concerns are deeply buried in the past, in a vision of history that seems simpler than the present. To his credit, he isn't another 1960s boomer insisting that everything was better back then, man-- his music hasn't changed that dramatically. There are a few moments of fuzzy nostalgia, as on ""He Was the King"", which takes liberties with Elvis's legendary exploits. But does anybody need to be reminded of Elvis's popularity when the same old songs are repackaged every holiday season? Or is that Young's point? Still, Prairie Wind is best when Young indulges personal reminiscences, as on ""Far From Home"", which starts with a fond memory: ""When I was a growing boy rockin' on my daddy's knee/ Daddy took an old guitar and sang 'Bury me on the lone prairie.'"" Young's dad appears again on the title track, and a less earthly father appears on ""When God Made Me"". ""This Old Guitar"" reminisces over his long career, and on the album opener, ""The Painter"", he nods to old friends who are either long gone or still hanging around for another album. Several of the musicians on Prairie Wind have played with Young many times before, including keyboard player Spooner Oldham, guitarist Ben Keith, bassist Rick Rosas, and Emmylou Harris. For such a seasoned band, though, they sound maybe a little too familiar: They tend to let the songs drag out, clocking in at five, six, or even seven minutes (the tiring title track) when three would work just fine. Intermingled with these private memories are larger concerns about Bush-era America, across which a cold prairie wind apparently blows. Yet Young's music is so rooted in the past, specifically the spirit of the 60s, that his stabs at contemporary relevance sound awkward and even curmudgeonly, as on ""No Wonder"" when he refers to ""America the Beautiful"" as ""that song from 9/11"" and quotes Chris Rock. Prairie Wind tries to gauge the present via the past, but there's a profound disconnect. But maybe Young is aware of it: ""I try to tell the people,"" he sings on the title track, ""But they never hear a word I say/ They say there's nothin' out there but wheat field anyway."" He sounds pretty frustrated, but Prairie Wind mostly is frustrating.","Neil Young turns 60 in November. In the last year he's survived an aneurysm and a greatest hits album ...

Inside/Absent,Broken Spindles,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b3ea9e61561daa4d3d/1:1/w_160/8b887a6c.gif,2005-09-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11687-insideabsent/,Saddle Creek,"Of all the bands in the ever-propagating petri dish that is Saddle Creek, Broken Spindles is arguably the most challenging. As Broken Spindles, Faint bassist Joel Petersen follows the tangent from his initial band's sepulchral new wave sound, coating it with a thick industrial sludge and fractured IDM. Nihilistic lyrics complete the equation, and Petersen's absolutely soulless delivery solidifies his status as Saddle Creek's answer to Trent Reznor. However, while the Faint were one of the main progenitors for today's new wave reincarnation, Broken Spindles merely rehashes staples of the not-so-distant past (NIN, Prodigy) with one eye on today's trendier acts (Kid 606, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone), the latter of which appearing too frequently for comfort on Inside/Absent. Petersen further dissociates himself from the Faint on his third album, as a first listen reveals the lack of guitar and drum parts, with a second revealing there ain't much bass left either. Horror movie piano lines team with ubiquitous blips and bleeps to constitute most of the sonic landscape here, mirroring the Petersen's stark, dehumanized vocals. On instrumental opener ""Inward"", Petersen plays the role of musician gone mad a bit too convincingly, steering through unstable fugues and OCD key pounding. Brief vignettes ""Desaturated"" and ""Valentine"" follow suit, sounding like xeroxed continuations. Of course, you're probably not interested in instrumentation, you just wanna hear about the intimate scene acted out by those weird dolls on the album cover. As part three of Broken Spindles' ""Trapped in the Closet""-esque series, Petersen tackles a topic ripe with disillusionment and dismay--love and relationships. ""Burn My Body"" features the album's lone guitar, showcasing the same angular riffs that makes the Faint's early material worth revisiting. Unfortunately, Petersen's masochistic lyrics reminds us why we should focus strictly on the music: ""Burn my body/ I'm taking up space/ Burn and mix me with plaster or paint."" The misanthropic sap thickens on humming laptop anti-ballad ""Anniversary"", with Petersen pining ""Counting our anniversaries/ Like they're a record of worth"" over a minimalist arrangement. Although such bleak production means an over-emphasis on the gauche lyrics, it amplifies Petersen's bread and butter--creating an utterly depressing, spirit-sucking atmosphere. Despite the malaise, Petersen still proves somewhat dynamic--even playful at times--on the album's catchier numbers. ""Please Don't Remember This"" shares The Downward Spiral's demented take on dance music while ""The Distance Is Nearsighted"" recalls Cex's droning vocals and skittish beats. Although not entirely original or groundbreaking, Petersen molds a more definite sound for Broken Spindles, one that's not simply electro-Faint or NIN lite. Problem is, now that Broken Spindles is legit, what's next? Inside/Absent is a nice listen, but doesn't hint at anything greater to come-- a frustrating flaw for an album already unexcited with itself.","On this side project, Faint bassist Joel Petersen coates his primary band's new wave with a thick industrial sludge and fractured IDM.

Attic Salt,Kepler,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb80abf31b7dc7155ade/1:1/w_160/2b703ad6.jpg,2005-09-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4404-attic-salt/,Troubleman Unlimited,"There was a time when artistic beauty wasn't regarded as a matter of intuitive personal vision or a relative standard buttressing the values of the elite class. Before the Enlightenment freed beauty from the dim hedge-maze of superstition and ushered it into the pure light of empiricism; before aesthetics became a valid mode of philosophical inquiry that favored beauty's mundane qualities over its divine ones; before post-structuralism wrought violence on binary values; an object's beauty was inextricably linked to its internal harmony of structure and function and its external harmony with the natural world. In other words, anything beautiful had to mirror divine creation, not subjective human values. Here in 2005, beauty remains under siege-- it's the new boring; it's all tied into hidden power structures; it's hard to dance to and resists innovation-- yet the concept of beauty, and our perception of it, persists. No matter how abstracted and censured it becomes, few would deny that, say, the oceans are beautiful. In a musical climate where beauty is often disregarded or located in asymmetrical euphony, bands like Kepler are clinging to an older and more concrete conception of beauty-- one that hinges on order, balance, and tradition. Like its namesake, the Canadian ex-slowcore (now just songcore) troupe arrays celestial happenings in elegant orbits, making songs that fit perfectly into circles like Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. If you replace ""slowcore"" with ""post-rock"" in Kepler's biography, the band's trajectory is parallel with Karate's (if compressed): Attic Salt is analagous to Pockets in its basic sonics and its triumphant, post-deconstructive lucidity. Here's ""Broken Bottles, Blackened Hearts"", a stately tide of lambent piano chords, lush reverb, and hushed cymbals ebbing and flowing below Samir Khan's tweedy (Jeff Tweedy, that is) vocals. Here's ""The Bedside Manner"", loping with the graceful yet muscular fluidity of a trotting horse. And here's ""Rented Limosine"", with arpeggios refracting through lapidary percussion like light through a prism. Here's an album that locates its force in its artisanal skill, not in its theoretical or innovative dimensions, and if it's not a dying breed, it's certainly an endangered one. This is not a call for art to return to Middle Age, or even neo-classical, values-- I place a high premium on art's capacity for innovation and social commentary. Rather, it is a call for a reassessment of the value of beauty, disabused of Judeo-Christian overtones but in full possession of its divine symmetry, at a time when its cultural relevance is dwindling. To reject the beauty of order is to reject the natural world. At the end of the day, Kepler's music is beautiful, like the sea is beautiful, and while we might not know exactly what this means, to disregard it wholesale as a biased cultural construct is to throw out the baby and the bath. It is also a deep loss to another confounding yet lasting, embarassing abstraction: The human spirit.","Troubleman Unlimited issues the latest from the Canadian ex-slowcore (now songcore) troupe.

Coles Corner,Richard Hawley,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c184c0084474cd0c335a/1:1/w_160/5e453a33.jpg,2005-09-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4023-coles-corner/,Mute,"It's impossible to discuss Sheffield singer and songwriter Richard Hawley without a glance backward in the general direction of strong, dignified vocalists like Roy Orbison, Fred Neil, and Johnny Cash. Hawley himself, former touring guitarist for Pulp and member of the second-tier Britpop band Longpigs, is forthcoming about his music's origins. His influences are not only on his sleeve, they're reflected in his tour schedule and his choice of collaborators. Yes, he sounds like he's listened to a lot of Lee Hazlewood; he's also opening for Nancy Sinatra at a number of dates in England. And not only is the Scott Walker connection undeniable, Hawley has spent time in the studio with the man himself after meeting initially through the Pulp connection. Coles Corner is Hawley's third full-length, and it finds him further refining his sound. His voice is richer and the arrangements have an extra smidge of polish. The songs are remarkably clear and direct, trading almost exclusively in familiar couplets that have become part of western pop currency. ""Hold back the night"" is the first line of the opening title track, and the chorus begins ""Going downtown where there's music/ Going where voices fill the air."" It's rarely difficult to pick out the next line. Yes, it's tears Hawley is talking about in ""Just Like the Rain"". The countrypolitan ballad ""Wait for Me"" seems plucked from another epoch: ""So think of me when you feel that moon,"" Hawley croons, ""oh it calls to me, as it calls to you."" First time through you might want to stop and say, Hold up, there's still a moon? I thought it fell from the sky somewhere in the early 70s. Yes, the moon is still up there, and Coles Corner is unapologetically retro to the max but it works. Hawley's style, his sturdy baritone singing songs that combine hints of country with pre-rock pop and orchestral flourishes overlaid with healthy dollop of reverb, has a robust appeal. It translates in 2005 because this corner of music was always about nostalgia and taut drama constructed with tightly circumscribed language. Hawley resides deep inside this material, writing songs with the melodic muscle to stand up next to standards. You can make a case against cultural recycling, but you can't argue away the emotional impact of the orchestral build on ""The Ocean"". As he describes a scene on a gray desolate beach where one imagines every day is like Sunday, new instruments are added bar-by-bar until and the tension is ratcheted up to the breaking point. With the tape saturated at the climax Hawley lets loose with a booming ""Here comes the rain!"" Pity the realist who reaches for the umbrella. The closing piano instrumental ""Last Orders"" is a cover that nicely punctuates how and why Hawley got here. It's played on an upright with the sustain pedal to the floor inside an empty cavern of a room. As the tune progresses the echo around the piano mixes with a dusty cloud of Eno-esque electronic treatment, the first time on the record we hear a sound that couldn't have been reproduced in the early '60s. Then finally the keyboard drops out completely to close with two minutes of a golden, light-speckled drone of aching poignancy. It's then you realize that Hawley's music can go wherever he wants it to go. He's not stuck in the past. He inhabits his record collection because he likes it there and has a feeling we will too. He's right.","Former Longpigs leader releases a gorgeous throwback reminiscent of Lee Hazlewood or Scott Walker.

Birds Make Good Neighbors,The Rosebuds,by: Amy Phillips,Managing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e8ea9e61561daa4b6e/1:1/w_160/b23fcde7.jpg,2005-09-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6891-birds-make-good-neighbors/,Merge,"What happened to the Rosebuds? When we first met singer/guitarist Ivan Howard and keyboardist/vocalist Kelly Crisp, they were blowing peppy power-pop smooches to each other on Make Out, gagging the cynical and wooing the goo-goo-eyed with Pixie Stix hooks and lyrics like ""First time I kissed you, I almost died."" Their outlook wasn't completely, err, rosy-- there were songs about sad drunks and a few hints of heartbreak-- but it was clear that this was a married couple utterly enthralled with their Big, Big Love. There's nothing wrong with Big, Big Love, or Pixie Stix hooks, but the Rosebuds weren't particularly good at either. Thankfully, their second full-length, Birds Make Good Neighbors, is a dark, disconcerting record that derives its power from restraint. It's Southern gothic through the filter of Ernest Hemingway, with the frightening stuff left off the page but seeping between the lines. There's a lot of love in these songs, but it's love in the face of a common enemy. ""And we'll get by/ And we tell ourselves one more time/ We get by/ And we brace ourselves and hold our hands and fight,"" Howard sings on the opening song, ""Hold Hands and Fight"". But it isn't a triumphant vow or some kind of pep talk. The music is ominous, with piano, tambourine, and stand-up bass throbbing quietly, haltingly. Howard's voice wobbles, slipping between notes. When the chorus swoops in with a gang of muted oohs and whoas, it sounds like the Arcade Fire, if the Arcade Fire were very, very scared. ""Hold Hands and Fight"" sets the template for most of the 10 tracks that follow. ""Boxcar"" imagines childhood fantasies of escape over an understated acoustic railroad chug. ""We could make a broom of weeds and brush and sweep all the daddies away,"" Howard moans, teetering on the edge of a Morrissey croon. Crisp's la-la-las on the chorus are instantly catchy, but far from sweet. Howard and Crisp play lovers separated by oceans and time in ""Leaves Do Fall"", eventually resolving to die rather than wait to be reunited. Teenagers hold each other close in the sanctuary of the garage in ""Wildcat"", as a family fight rages on inside the house. ""Blue Bird"" longs for the country from inside the city; ""Outnumbered"" awaits certain doom over surf-guitar jangle. These songs are infused with a hint of twangy menace, bubbling under but never exploding. The Rosebuds avoid the easy, melodramatic path, instead opting for subdued delivery and an atmosphere of uncomfortable tension. But it's uncomfortable in a good way. When they fall back on the lovey-dovey stuff on the call-and-response group sing-along ""Shake Our Tree"" and the sappy pledge of devotion ""Warm Where You Lay"", the album falters. Who put this chick flick in my psychological thriller? Perhaps Birds' shadowy sound signals the end of the honeymoon period of the Crisp/Howard marriage, and the beginning of facing the problems of a long-term relationship. But if they sound this good now, man, I can't wait until they get divorced.","Merge's husband-and-wife duo deliver a dark, disconcerting indie pop record that improves greatly on their debut.

Things you can do: Sit there and take it. No passive response can be taken to XBXRX's racket. Sixth in Sixes is not background noise; it's simply noise. Don't take that as negative-- if teeth-gnashing catharsis through guitar is your idea of fun, then this record is fun as hell. If not, it's over quickly. Throughout the entire 25-minute duration of these 18 tracks, guitars thrash in thin, abrasive approximations of hardcore and acid-fried rock, the drums batter new rhythms every few seconds, and the singer squeals righteously about progress, corruption, and the decline of civilization. On the final song, ""In Memory of Our Lives"", you can even make out what he's saying. Sixth in Sixes may have sounded like a wall of hysterics at first, but a few more listens and the complexity started to seep in. This is the band's second record, and they sound more mature and generally more competent at playing than on 2001's Gop Ist Minee, if no less confrontational. Reunited with drummer Weasel Walter, XBXRX can pull off tricks like moving from an overstimulated boogie to a three-chord whirling dervish spitting out bent notes on ""Gold Cross"", and jerk to the Devo-through-the-wood-chipper rhythms on ""Fabricated Progression"". There's even two tracks longer than two minutes with discernable melodies. (I guess you call that ""artistic growth."") The chaos of ""Beat Rolls on"" is grounded by the minimal stomp of the rhythm section, and the obligatory change in rhythm sounds built up to and earned, as if we followed the band instead of being repeatedly slapped by them. ""In Memory of Our Lives"" is a superb closer, leaving the listener with the album's best hook and most direct vocals. Anchored by a constant fourth-note bassline, the singing loses none of its frenzy, but becomes abundantly clear: ""The liars, the killers/ The ones who sold our lives/ Making profits, hitting targets/ Leaving every child behind."" XBXRX's live performances are notoriously chaotic (enough to supposedly get the group banned from Canada), and while catching one of their shows may make a great story to tell the next day, the album is nothing to write home about. Sixth in Sixes is gleefully relentless, but songs like ""Beat Rolls on"" and ""In Memory of Our Lives"" are an inkling that XBXRX are capable of much more. They're also the only evidence the band is making records for posterity, and not just for a souvenir from the show.","Things you can't do while listening to XBXRX's new record, Sixth in Sixes: Read a book, do your ...

Jacksonville City Nights,Ryan AdamsThe Cardinals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00313d19756521382a4/1:1/w_160/acafb7e1.jpg,2005-09-27 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/43-jacksonville-city-nights/,Lost Highway,"Nearly a dozen albums in, counting Whiskeytown, Ryan Adams' shtick is that it's all shtick. If so much alt-country turned out to be a poseur's game of authenticity chic-- with a happy surfeit of strong songwriting, to be sure-- then no one embraced his poseurdom more openly than Ryan Adams. ""I started this damn country band/ 'Cause punk rock was too hard to sing,"" he admitted from the get-go, while some of his less obviously contrived precursors were setting old Woody Guthrie verses to music. When Adams' 2003 Rock N Roll and Love Is Hell EPs wrinkled critical noses, it wasn't due just to their brazenly derivative artifice-- 2000 landmark Heartbreaker, after all, simply reworked Gram Parsons-- but to a paucity of songs that could break their gilded genre-exercise cages. You could be forgiven for not noticing, but earlier this year Adams started writing good songs again. I know! Bearded and bespectacled (new first name ""Grizzly"" bwahaha), his fret hand rejuvenated after an onstage smithereening, the Artist Forever-Ever Known as ""Prolific"" hired a great new band, handed them a fully collaborative role, and laid down the surprisingly solid two-platter, pro-Grateful Dead polemic Cold Roses. Well slap me prose-purple and squirt dime-store gin up my nose, 'cause the second leg of Adams and the Cardinals' three-albums-in-one-year gimmickathon, Jacksonville City Nights, is even better-- succeeding where the equally grandiose same-day one-two punch of Rock N Roll/Love Is Hell Pt. 1 so bitterly disappointed just a pair of years prior. Jacksonville City Nights reveals an Adams finally undaunted by his own conceits. Ostensibly named for Adams' hometown of Jacksonville, N.C., it's the troubadour's countriest effort since 1996's Faithless Street, only countrier-- lovesick sepia with pedal steel, string touches, and cry-in-your-unironic-Pabst honky-tonk piano. After the Garcia-esque sierra grassiness of Cold Roses, Adams vocals here conjure an unfaltering, fatherly pastiche of great country voices, from muddy Merle Haggard vibrato interspersed throughout to the Hank Williams yodel of ""Peaceful Valley"" or one-time Whiskeytown rarity ""My Heart Is Broken"". Though many of even Adams' most nostalgic lyrics could plausibly claim a contemporary setting, these 14 tracks exist primarily in the landscape of deathly sad river-bottom country, as inexorably grim as an unabridged fairy tale. It's in this sense that Jacksonville City Nights is also Adams' most unbelievable album-- a lethal blow to the ""based on a true story!"" emo verisimilitude of so many singer-songwriters not named Dylan. It's difficult to believe Adams, productive as he undoubtedly is, when he sings of ""working hard ever since I was a kid"" over the chugga-chugga acoustic guitar of ""Trains"", or drawls, ""Pay my respects to the company store"" on upbeat first single ""The Hardest Part"". Norah Jones is equally unconvincing in their duet as she exhales, ""I ended up with a house full of cats"", with Adams providing high harmonies over Carole King ivories on one of the album's least successful tracks (their voices never quite mesh). Whether dreaming of an old-fashioned heaven or addressing a lover as ""gal"", Adams does less than usual to dispel accusations of affectation; this time, the songs' merit brushes most such charges aside. Besides, what did you expect, ""Summer of '69""? Adams' country-fueled freedom from the constraints of constructed authenticity permits him to plumb his darkest depths yet, and some of his most affecting. The suicidal miserablism of his 2002 Demolition's ""Dear Chicago"", itself essentially a dark sequel to post-Sept. 11 hit ""New York, New York"", is nothing next to the stark piano ballad ""Silver Bullets"", in which the narrator gets his gun because ""I can't make you love me/ And you can't make me stay"". Slow gravestone story-songs like erstwhile title track ""September"" are far more effectively mopey than Adams' mope-rock Love Is Hell. More disturbing, too: Adams' casual ""sha la la"" bridge amid the three possible deaths in ""Pa"" spreads the song's comfortable country-waltz stitching over the grisliness beneath, rewarding careful listens. Here Adams' narrators more often look at love from the other side, but they instill its memory with appropriately homespun life. ""I could find her in a thunderstorm/ Just by the way that the rain would fall,"" Adams sings on the more Parsons-like ""Hard Way to Fall""; ""Met a dark-haired girl that the Mississippi moon/ Musta left by mistake one night,"" he recalls on ""The Hardest Part"" (that part turns out to be love, of course). Opener ""A Kiss Before I Go"" sets the stage for Adams' country departure, moving beyond its conventional one-shot one-beer refrain to envision ""a place where nobody cries"". Title aside, ""Withering Heights"" keeps it simple, Adams' voice falling to a whisper; choked plea ""Don't Fail Me Now"" (formerly known as ""When the Rope Gets Tight"") closes the album fit to hang. Only nondescript ballad ""Games"" fails to leave any impression. If Adams ever lets his guard down on Jacksonville City Nights, it's on second track ""The End"", which many casual listeners will inevitably remember as ""Jacksonville"" for its double-edged refrain. Adams moseys through evocative images-- ""Pentecostal pines"", leaves that ""burn like effigies of my kin""-- before a playful, improvisatory second verse (guess the missing rhyme!). Yet the fiction, the song, is the thing. After so many outings spent imitating others, it's tempting to see this progression to traditional country as Adams finally imitating himself; more accurately, Jacksonville City Nights is a well-lit snapshot of a talented mythmaker modeling his best honky-tonk garb-- and this time, holy shtick, the tailoring is almost impeccable.","Nearly a dozen albums in, counting Whiskeytown, Ryan Adams' shtick is that it's all shtick.

Surgery,The Warlocks,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d55e6ef959693214a7/1:1/w_160/f251581f.jpg,2005-09-27 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8586-surgery/,Mute,"Warlocks, as far as I can tell, are not the enemy. Some people disagree though, and with good reason: Think of all the rock bands that would love to call themselves Warlocks, but they can't because of...Warlocks. Instead they had to settle for ""Bloc Party"" or ""Get Him Eat Him"" or worse, ""John Vanderslice."" During Surgery I became 80% convinced the only reason Warlocks put out records is to keep others from taking their band name. The other 20% I'm dead fucking sure these un-magical ass clowns are retards running with scissors, shit down their legs, hoping somebody-- anybody-- might take off his hat and put change in it for them. ""Come save us,"" Warlocks sing on their lazy schlock-called-stoner rock opener. ""Come save us, from ourselves."" Not to say there isn't an aesthetic at work here! If you've ever gone into Guitar Center, to the section of the store with the guitars on the wall, inevitably you'll see at least three pimply dudes jackknifed over strapless Gibsons, left foot on the amp, their step-moms arms-folded and begrudgingly ""fostering a relationship"" with their hubbies' chump sons. The song the kids are all playing goes something like ""Thursday's Radiation"", which the Warlocks have graciously included midway through Surgery. The amp's built-in distortion option flipped up, one finger backs and forths over one string while the rest are left open, for no other reason than the kids have no idea what to do with them. Loud, soft, fast, slow, endless eighth-note down-strums, then the crucial question: ""Is playing guitar this easy?"" Step-mom's fake boobs say yes. Apparently Warlocks used to sing about drugs or whatever, how awesome they are, the hilarious things that happen to your butt when you eat cat tranqs, etc. Ho ho ho, save ""It's Just Like Surgery"" (""There's no one else, that makes me feel the way that you do""), I think they've finally gotten it out of their system. Which leaves Warlocks with what exactly? A mopey bunch of trite sap O.D.-type tales almost as unstomachable as the band's former crapothecary hymns. The worst is bubblegum-gone-stale ""The Tangent"": ""As they feel his pulse/ Disappear without a trace/ What are we going to do?/ They all scream."" The second-worst is ""We Need Starpower"", second-worst only because I hate meta-commentaries: ""How does one feel to be so dead inside?"" Oh fucking boy.

Duel at Dawn,Mommy and Daddy,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54713d197565213bf97/1:1/w_160/732d0242.jpg,2005-09-27 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5640-duel-at-dawn/,Kanine,"Some of my favorite bands pull melody from miasma, but Mommy and Daddy's melodies are miasmas, hard brusque things that team up with their gritty backdrops. There is no faint glow seeping through clouds of cosmic dust, no trapped heart pulsing beneath spiritless pummel; just two robo-kids who happen to know a few scales. So forget tenderness, Mommy and Daddy have none. Each song on Duel at Dawn promises two things: a stupid-hard drumbeat and oversaturated synths. Such is the extent of its aesthetic breadth, and Mommy and Daddy make no apologies for their insularity. Ignore the almost wholly synthetic sound matter and you get garage rock, more or less. ""A Good Deal"" is a shuffle of arena-sized proportions, all boom-bap drums and fuzzy one-line hook. It might be directly inspired by any number of Jock Jams staples. Same goes for ""Cops"", which psyched me with a sibilant modified schaffel intro before taking the caveman stomp route. (Best part: dissonant, half-step organ quarters-- Andrew W.K., meet your evil doppelganger.) ""Lost the Plot"" even calls in tambourine to accompany its growling bass-as-hook and standard-issue ""whoa-oh-oh""s. Mommy and Daddy seem hellbent on making fatuous, subtlety-free music, but sometimes they can't help it-- everyone needs a little sonic primping. Witness: the beats. These aren't graceless 808 belches, but coordinated, if simplistic, rhythms comprised of carefully chosen sounds. 'Cause hey, each violent throb has its proper snare timbre and cymbal decay. So, while what I really want from a track like ""Way West Way""-- which has all the riffy makings of awesomeness-- is unchecked Keith Moon bombast, I can appreciate the button-pressing technique. This variant of DIY electro-punk is the Miami booty bass of indie rock: music with sharp angles and dubious ambitions. But unlike booty bass, which has a forum to release its glorious, vapid, think-with-your-pelvis energy, Mommy and Daddy do not own any dancefloors. Their breed of dumb fun gets turned away at the door and rebottled as headachey tension. I'd love to say the lyrics bolster the sound, but, like the hooks, they're subservient to the scuzz and sass, more vibe than content. Really, it's sedative or bust: Spend the full two-thirds' hour in this rubber room of an album and you'll be overhyped and screaming to be let out.","Second album of DIY electro-punk from the New York duo.

In Space,Big Star,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab66c0084474cd0c1386/1:1/w_160/ca27cd95.jpg,2005-09-27 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8981-in-space/,Ryko,"This Big Star really isn't Big Star. Sure, it has two of the founding members, Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens, and it has two touring members, Jonathan Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies. Sure, that's the same line-up that played on Big Star's last release, Columbia: Live at Missouri University 4/25/93, and that's the same line-up that's been touring on and off for years as Big Star. They've remained Big Star longer than any other of the other incarnations, but judging from the band's first album of new material-- the first bearing the name Big Star in nearly 30 years-- they sound more like the countless Big Star followers than Big Star. Band names are essentially brand names, especially in the case of Big Star, which took its moniker from a regional chain of grocery stores. That choice proved ironic: Despite critical acclaim and best efforts, the band never achieved any sort of stardom, but instead gradually became cult kings. For a band like Big Star to release a new album of original material 30 years after what most believed was their last is a calculated risk: It's sure to get people's attention, but it also threatens to devalue the brand. In Space isn't as terrible as internet chatter predicted. In fact, it's not really bad at all, even though it starts off aggressively mediocre. The opener ""Dony"" has Jim Spake's out-of-nowhere sax solo to enliven its midtempo pop, but Auer and Stringfellow's ""Lady Sweet"" and Stephens' ""Best Chance We've Ever Had"" lack any such flourish. ""Turn My Back on the Sun"" starts with a Beach Boys fake-out-- a toy piano melody and the words ""Wouldn't it..."", but ""be nice"" is replaced with ""surprise somebody to find."" That's the lyrical highlight of In Space. Most other songs are full of banal sentiments (""the sunlight in your hair seems to stop time""), hoary cliches (""Lady Sweet/ Looks like she can't be beat""), and simplistic rhyme schemes. The band sounds hesitant and maybe uncommitted, and instead of conveying feelings, these first songs reveal a lack of ideas, suggesting that Big Star don't have much to say. It's not until ""Love Revolution"" that In Space begins to pick up a little. The song is so silly it's almost embarrassing-- a disco-lite anthem with shout-outs for all-night lovemaking and platform shoes. But at least it sounds like they're having fun. It kicks off a middle section that's a lively and energetic remedy to the songs that precede it. Stephens' ""February's Quiet"" is no revelation, but it's a sweet ode to making it through the cold months with the one you love. ""A Whole New Thing"", ""Do You Wanna Make It"", and their cover of the Olympics' ""Mine Exclusively"" bounce with a groove that recalls their former label's house band, Booker T. and the MGs, and the awkwardly charming ""Aria Largo"" sounds like the coolest wedding processional ever. But In Space ends on a dim note, with the mess that they've titled ""Makeover"". It's the inverse of ""Love Revolution""-- a self-impressed racket that's not even salvaged by its insistent bassline. Still, for all its bright spots, In Space is not much more than adequate power pop. It's hard to judge the album on its own terms and almost impossible to shake the fact that it would sound better with another band's name on the spine, one that didn't invite hopeless comparisons to #1 Record, Radio City, and Third/Sisters Lovers. For instance, In Space would be a decent Posies album, and there's enough for a passable Chilton solo joint, but as a Big Star release, it's inescapably disappointing.","First Big Star studio release in three decades features Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens, plus Jonathan Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies.

Just Say Sire,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8569d034d5c69bf3a05/1:1/w_160/736d23c0.gif,2005-09-27 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2099-just-say-sire/,RhinoWEARhinoWEA,"I can't honestly recommend that you drop $59 dollars on this box set, but I can certainly advise that you damn the revisionist historians and love it in spirit. Because there's a fight going on-- a fight over who constituted the ""real"" alternative audience of the 1980s-- and I'm making it my responsibility to put you on the right side of the thing. To get a sense of the battle lines, just listen to the Dead Milkmen's ""Instant Club Hit"" (1987), a fake dance track in which a band of American punk pranksters take their shots at goths, ""art fags,"" ""boring bisexuals,"" and ""Danceateria types"": ""You'll dance to anything by the Smiths/ You'll dance to anything by Depeche Commode [sic]."" One of few things funnier than this song is the fact that the stuff inside it is still at issue. Poke around, and you'll find plenty of people who'll tell you that the real, important music of the 1980s came from bug-eyed Californian punks (like Black Flag), beer-friendly Midwestern rockers (like Hüsker Dü), and D.C. hardcore kids (like Minor Threat); that major labels did nothing but ruin greedy bands (like the Replacements); that make-up, synthesizers, and the Milkmen's ""stupid Europeans with big hairdos"" didn't matter and/or exist; and that singer-songwriters, ""rootsy"" music, and adult pop were a million miles away. In the opposite camp, you'll find clear-eyed realists with actual memories, who'll happily admit that as of the mid-80s plenty of well-informed people really liked R.E.M. and Suzanne Vega. Both of these groups can be right, in the end, but notice how much the first of them relies on selective memory? Every time they talk about the ""real underground"" or nitpick about which bands were on truly independent labels, what they're really doing is writing off those who genuinely liked 10,000 Maniacs or Echo & the Bunnymen-- the equivalent of someone, 20 years from now, pretending that this decade was all about Wolf Eyes and Lightning Bolt, and nobody listened to Feist, or Annie, or Radiohead. Here's the truth: If you flipped on your local college radio station toward the close of the 80s, chances are you'd hear all of this stuff, jumbled together-- Milkmen and Minutemen, Ministry and Morrissey, plus Edie Brickell to boot. Arguing about which 80s breeds were important and which were merely incidental forgets the sheer variety of stuff that got thrown into the not-quite-mainstream fold. And what's bizarre is this: Even in our current climate, where mp3 trading has supposedly made it so that everyone is pop-friendly, fun-loving, non-rockist, and open-eared, the Real Underground Music camp still seems to be winning this argument. Why this matters: Because Seymour Stein's Sire Records, an imprint founded in 1966 and folded into Warner Bros a decade later, was a pretty major source of the quirky, often-accessible, sometimes-popular ""college rock"" the Undergrounders are so keen on telling you they paid no attention to-- and this box collects three CDs and one video disc of the label's peak-era highlights. As a corrective to some people's critical histories, it's a joy. Better still: If I were rating this collection based on the pure quality of the music it contains, as opposed to a whole bunch of considerations about your time and your money, it'd be up there in the eights. Sire's catalog spent most of its time straddling the lines of stylish, accessible pop and acts just a little too different to push at the mainstream. Stein was attuned to New York City punk (Ramones, Richard Hell), and even more so to its new-wave trajectory (Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Kid Creole). He picked winners from cross-Atlantic new wave (Rezillos, Plastic Bertrand), and followed synth-pop from its grotty start (Telex, the Normal) to its stupid-European-big-hair heyday (Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, Soft Cell). Across the length of the 80s, Stein's Sire played the same role Geffen's DGC played for the 90s, rounding up the popular, accessible end of America's college-rock guitar bands (Dinosaur Jr, the Replacements, the Ocean Blue) and-- maybe more importantly-- licensing the rest from the UK (Cure, Smiths, and Bunnymen), to the point where the 1990 edition of their Just Say... samplers managed to import early tastes of My Bloody Valentine's ""Soon"" and Primal Scream's ""Higher Than the Sun"". And Sire also served as a home for adult, mainstream-y pop acts whose sounds or personas scared everyone else off, such as k.d. lang or Israeli icon Ofra Haza. What does this mean? It means that instead of the straight-line history of Important Underground Bands, this box offers something that looks more like what some of your 1977-1993 analogs might really have been paying attention to. Like the Pretenders, pop godfathers of the ""college"" audience. Like synth-pop, or like 2-Tone-ish cuts from Madness and the English Beat. Like Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, back when ""rootsy"" music was considered polite and adult and niche-marketed, instead of being touted as progressive. Like fresh or just plain lovable pop singles: Seal's futurist ""Crazy"", Modern English's ""I Melt with You"", and the Cult's ""Fire Woman"" (or the Farm's ""Groovy Train,"" more for nostalgia than quality). Like Brian Wilson and Lou Reed, popular figures important to the ""underground"" in the same studied way they are today. Like the Rezillos' ""Top of the Pops"", the most gleefully spiky new-punk single ever not-released by the Buzzcocks, or Aztec Camera's ""Oblivious"", the distilled core of the kind of pretty 1980s British guitar-pop your Black Flag fans would spit on. And, this era marking the birth of the music video, a full disc of those-- from M's ""Pop Muzik"" to the Replacements and Madonna to Belly and Aphex Twin. Now look: I don't necessarily fault the Undergrounders. All they're really trying to do is narrow their critical history down to talk about the ""important"" things that happened in the underground, the things that really changed. They can leave it to pop writers to talk about synthesizers and ""traditional"" guitar bands-- and the slurs they'd have thrown at those types are certainly true for some of the acts here, from the Mighty Lemon Drops to Martini Ranch. Maybe it really isn't so important to talk about a singer-songwriter like Suzanne Vega when people today will just pick up Keren Ann records doing the exact same thing. But in that process of narrowing everything down, the first victim is, well, reality-- and any hope of talking seriously about the actual music culture of people who were probably a lot like you. Twenty years from now, when someone's going on about the underground of the oughts, some of you may need to step forward and let it be known: A lot of you really like the Arcade Fire, too. A lot of you really like the Decemberists, M.I.A., Devendra Banhart, Madvillain, Antony & the Johnsons, the Fiery Furnaces, Basement Jaxx, and whatever other acts the future writes off as conventional or popular in the interest of its Grand Narrative of Music Going Forward. Their narrative may be ""right"" and ""important,"" but yours will be ""true,"" and therefore probably ""more interesting.""","Three CDs and one DVD collecting 61 tracks and 20 videos from Seymour Stein's often-adventurous label.

Self Help Serenade,Marjorie Fair,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36ac0084474cd0c347c/1:1/w_160/4c83e628.jpg,2005-09-26 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5665-self-help-serenade/,Capitol,"The best lyrics off Self Help Serenade cover sex in folding chairs (""We gave her half a million shares/ To sleep with her boss in a folding chair""), and the worst are typical drama-queen bellyaches: Girls are ""death and beauty at the same time"" and ""Daylight is not the same/ When you're stabbing at the stars in your eyes/ And bleeding is what you see."" The weakest part of Marjorie Fair's Nickelback-copycat act is that singer Evan Slamka doesn't understand that even down-trodden chamber pop can still be part deux of ""How You Remind Me"". He makes the mistake of handing us a heart worth breaking (i.e., his own, sad sucker): Glossy angst this oblivious errs regrettably on the side of self-indulgence-- while it's probably more naiveté than hubris, it's still unpardonable. Observe Slamka, born and raised in New Jersey, calling L.A.'s Skid Row ""very fast-paced, with lots of drug-related issues,"" and articulating that his short-lived residency has taught him ""more about the human condition."" Big names-- Jon Brion, Billy Preston, Jerry Finn, Rob Schaff-- assist him in communicating ""feelings deep inside,"" but that's no recipe for surefire success: Marjorie Fair's shiny Beach Boys-meets-Pernice Brothers act suffers primarily from well-intentioned overproduction. Deceptively lovely arrangements are, in all likelihood, responsible for the UK release's resounding hand-clappery, but overlook lush, dreamy, and too-deliberate arrangements, and there's little else that points to greatness. Self Help Serenade ends up like the Thrills' So Much For the City: Its vision, however elaborately constructed, is monotone to a fault. The album's merits lie mainly with upbeat departures from humdrum tempos. ""Empty Room"" and ""Waves"" are standout tracks-- catchy gems to otherwise lugubrious melodies. ""Please Don't"" would be Self Help's ""Butterfly"" (soft-spoken, repentant) if the album in question were Pinkerton-- only problem is, it's not: Where Weezer's loser-rock once excelled by sharing these sentiments, there's no tension on Self Help-- no restraint or release, just weepy nitpicking. Ballads threaten to impress but wind up sluggish and repetitive. ""My Sun Is Setting Over Her Magic"" is the band's best example of the graceful restraint but it should be more concise and its sentiment more simply expressed: ""My heart is sinking under the weight/ Of things so clear I can hardly tell/ If it's you or if it's me"" has nothing on ""Don't talk/ Put your head on my shoulder."" It might be heartless to fault Slamka from good-intentioned extremes-- caring too much and trying too hard-- but please: The road to lyrical hell is paved with them, and bad poetry is still bad poetry. Heartfelt or not, Self Help Serenade could stand to undergo revision. Slamka is the sort of writer who doubles as mother; he loves all of his children, though he'd do better to drown three of five kittens. Next time around, Marjorie Fair should subdue cheap heartstring tugs-- quit upping production, start killing off proverbial kittens.","Jon Brion, Billy Preston, Jerry Finn, and Rob Schaff offer production help to this shiny Beach Boys-meets-Pernice Brothers act.

I suppose that makes Bellini just good ol' math rock-- the mid- to late-90s kind on Touch and Go and Quarterstick. This figures, as Giovanna Cacciola (vocals) and Agostino Tilotta (Guitar) were in Uzeda, and Alexis Fleisig (drums) was in Girls Against Boys. Bellini's previous album, Snowing Sun, worked thanks to the bionic drumming of Damon Che from Don Cabellero. But then again that was a few years ago, when the world was simpler. It was also prior to the comi-tragic departure of Che, which would provide tabloid-esque fodder for the indie rock world. Today, Bellini sound like...well, Uzeda. Cacciola still takes her English lyrics and morphs them into that of a mourning siren from a Giallo film. Tilotta's guitar work still consists of sharp jabs played at high volume, sounding reminiscent of Shellac. Maybe that's because Steve Albini is still recording Cacciola and Tilotta. The oft-forgotten rhythm section of Fleisig and Matthew Taylor both fulfill their job duties and make sure the songs drive forward, without any of the screwing around that was present on Snowing Sun. ""The Buffalo Song"" finds Cacciola yelling over some fine post-rock noodling/riffery; Bellini switch it up on ""Not Any Man"" which has Cacciola mellowing out and cooing, ""Say I called you my love"" like a mix of Tara Jane ONeil and PJ Harvey. Bellini move from crescendo to groove in ""The Exact Distance to the Stars"" while Cacciola mixes surrealistic bedroom behavior with existentialism. All in all, Small Stones is a cohesive album, but its songs just plod down a road that is already heavily trafficked. But then again if you love their style of music, then it's nice to have a band like Bellini that's gonna consistently give you albums of the same quality, even if they only arrive every three years.","Temporary Residence act loses the bionic drumming of Damon Che but keeps its core sound-- mid- to late-90s Touch and Go/Quarterstick-style math-rock.

Tuning to the Rooster,Vibracathedral Orchestra,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a957ea9e61561daa5a0a/1:1/w_160/3f07ef30.jpg,2005-09-26 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8466-tuning-to-the-rooster/,Important,"As evidenced by their explosive appearance on this year's epic The Tone of the Universe (= The Tone of the Earth) compilation, Leeds-based quintet Vibracathedral Orchestra (VCO) have long since earned themselves a place of honor in the international avant-drone firmament. In parallel with such like-minded contemporaries as Birchville Cat Motel and Richard Youngs, Vibracathedral have operated at their own unique nexus of Kraut-damaged rock, turbulent pan-ethnic folk, and Terry Riley/Tony Conrad-inspired minimalism. Before now, however, all of the group's copious output-- at least 17 full-length releases in various formats-- had been recorded live directly to two-track. But for Tuning to the Rooster, VCO joined producer Richard Formby (Spaceman 3, Spectrum) in a full 24-track studio, an upgrade that has resulted in what is surely the group's most vibrantly detailed eruption to date. Centered since their formation in 1998 around the veteran axis of Julian Bradley, Neil Campbell, and Michael Flower-- and here joined by longtime regulars Adam Davenport and Bridget Hayden-- the group's work has always possessed the ornate density to justify the ""Orchestra"" designation despite their relatively small roll-call. Perhaps it's appropriate, then, that the four lengthy pieces gathered here can resemble the movements of an extended drone symphony, one that is clearly best absorbed in its entirety. The album's adept symmetry and cohesion seems particularly noteworthy considering that each of these pieces has previously appeared elsewhere in the VCO discography in an alternate or abbreviated form. Shorter versions of the two opening tracks both originally appeared on VCO's 2002 split LP with Jackie-O Motherfucker. ""Baptism>Bar>Blues"" commences the album with the group already in mid-sunburst, as their lacerating layers of violin, guitar feedback and roiling percussion quickly reach prolonged crescendos that sound as if they've already been building for hours. Before long, this view dissolves seamlessly into ""Wearing Clothes of Ash,"" a 17-minute edifice of drone featuring placid ripples of piano that pierce through the ongoing sandstorm din like tiny shafts of starlight. On this track the higher resolution of the album's production is particularly effective; where on previous records Vibracathedral's individual instruments might all be consumed into one singular monochromatic blur, here each jagged note is free to swirl past with microscopic, technicolor clarity. Following next is the violin/harmonium/electronic stomp ""Stole Some Sentimental Jewelry"", which conjures Cale-era VU improvising on a sabre-rattling Eastern European folk motif, while ""Girls with Rocks in Their Hands"" encircles a ambient riff with a steadfast patience that suggests that Vibracathedral Orchestra might easily be capable of prolonging its repetitions indefinitely. And since Tuning to the Rooster cuts off with the group still arched in mid-swell, when set on continuous play this finale can be joined almost imperceptibly back to the album's beginning to create a Mobius Strip-like listening experience, one whose mesmeric loops you'll be happy to uncoil for hours.","Avant-drone band operate at the nexus of Kraut-damaged rock, turbulent pan-ethnic folk, and Terry Riley/Tony Conrad-inspired minimalism.

I've talked about this album with a lot of people, including Pitchfork readers and music writers, and while it is loved in the indie world like few others, a small but still significant number despise it. Aeroplane doesn't have the near-consensus of top-shelf 90s rock artifacts like, say, Loveless, OK Computer, or Slanted and Enchanted. These records are varied, of course, different in many ways. But in one key respect Aeroplane stands apart: This album is not cool. Shortly after the release of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, Puncture magazine had a cover story on Neutral Milk Hotel. In it Mangum told of the influence on the record of Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl. He explained that shortly after releasing On Avery Island he read the book for the first time, and found himself completely overwhelmed with sadness and grief. Back in 1998 this admission made my jaw drop. What the hell? A guy in a rock band saying he was emotionally devastated by a book everyone else in America read for a middle-school assignment? I felt embarrassed for him at first, but then, the more I thought about it and the more I heard the record, I was awed. Mangum's honesty on this point, translated directly to his music, turned out to be a source of great power. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is a personal album but not in the way you expect. It's not biography. It's a record of images, associations, and threads; no single word describes it so well as the beautiful and overused ""kaleidoscope."" It has the cracked logic of a dream, beginning with ""King of Carrot Flowers Part 1"". The easiest song on the record to like on first listen, it quietly introduces the listener to the to the album's world, Mangum singing in a muted voice closer to where he left off with the more restrained On Avery Island (through most of Aeroplane he sounds like he's running out of time and struggling to get everything said). The first four words are so important: ""When you were young..."" Like every perceptive artist trafficking in memory, Mangum knows dark surrealism to be the language of childhood. At a certain age the leap from kitchen utensils jammed into dad's shoulder to feet encircled by holy rattlesnakes is nothing. A cock of the head; a squint, maybe. Inside this dream it all begins in the body. Moments of trauma, joy, shame-- here they're all experienced first as physical sensation. A flash of awkward intimacy is recalled as ""now how I remember you/ how I would push my fingers through your mouth/ to make those muscles move."" Sometimes I hear this line and chuckle. I think of Steve Martin in The Jerk, licking Bernadette Peters' entire face as a sign of affection. Mangum here reflects the age when biological drives outpace the knowledge of what to do with them, a time you're seeing sex in everything (""semen stains the mountaintops"") or that sex can be awkward and unintentionally painful (""fingers in the notches of your spine"" is not what one usually hopes for in the dark). Obsessed as it is with the textures of the flesh and the physical self as an emotional antenna, listening to Aeroplane sometimes seems to involve more than just your ears. Then there's the record's disorienting relationship to time. The instrumentation seems plucked randomly from different years in the 20th century: singing saws, Salvation Army horn arrangements, banjo, accordion, pipes. Lyrical references to technology are hard to fix. Anne Frank's lifespan from 1929 to 1945 is perhaps the record's historical center, but the perspective jumps back and forth over centuries, with images and figures sucked from their own age and squirted out somewhere else. When ""The King of Carrot Flowers Part 3"" mentions ""a synthetic flying machine"" our minds leap to something like Leonardo da Vinci's 15th Century drawings of his helicopter prototype. The image in ""Two-Headed Boy"" of a mutant child trapped in a jar of formaldehyde is pulled from Dr. Moreau's industrial age island. The radio play powered by pre-electric pulleys and weights, the nuclear holocaust in the title track. What's it all about? Mangum offers an explanation for these jarring leaps in a line about Anne Frank in ""Oh Comely,"" where he sings, ""I know they buried her body with others/ her sister and mother and 500 families/ and will she remember me 50 years later/ I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine."" If you can move through time, see, nothing ever really dies. Seven years it's been, and whether Mangum has had personal trouble or somehow lost his way with music, it's not unreasonable to think that we've heard the last from Neutral Milk Hotel. I hope he does, but he may never pick up the guitar he set down after ""Two-Headed Boy Part Two."" Even so, we have this album and another very good one, and that to me is serious riches. Amazing to think how it started, how at the core of it all was guts. I keep thinking of ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding,"" and one of Dylan's truest lines: ""If my thought-dreams could be seen/ They'd probably put my head in a guillotine."" Aeroplane is what happens when you have that knowledge and still take the risk.","The reissue of Neutral Milk Hotel’s cult classic offers another opportunity to measure its reach and influence. Jeff Mangum’s masterpiece mixes hushed folk, explosive brass, and unforgettable vocals that touch on pain, loss, memory, and hope.

The Fast Rise & Fall of the South,Kingsbury Manx,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb2c0084474cd0c2903/1:1/w_160/fb690ed8.jpg,2005-09-25 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4454-the-fast-rise-fall-of-the-south/,Yep Roc,"As I prepared to write this review, I learned manxes are domestic cats with no tails bred on the Isle of Man. I google-imaged ""manx"" and the fourth result was a picture of a tabby climbing drapes, which is strangely appropriate considering the Kingsbury Manx's own softness and lightness on their feet. Kittens aside, there's really no better visual descriptor for their sound than the cover of Let You Down, their second album, which features a high-contrast painting of brooding clouds in a close-cropped, indeterminate corner of the sky. The Fast Rise & Fall of the South is the band's fourth full-length. After flirting with heavier rhythms and a more overt pop sound on 2003's Aztec Discipline, the Manx return to the more languid, understated sound of their first two LPs. Their sound is again subtle and stately, full of the humid tension and electric tingle of a summer thunderstorm. It has something of an affinity, both in tempo and melodic content, with early-70s Pink Floyd, especially Obscured By Clouds and side 1 of Meddle. The record is stuffed with two-part harmonies and country-lane textures-- banjos, acoustic guitars and wood block percussion mix with piano, mellotron, and organ. The waltz has always been a formidable weapon in the hands of the Manx, but they outdo themselves on opener ""Harness and Wheel"", with swaying pianos, woozy harmonies, and cyclical guitar picking. ""And What Fallout!"" follows with a 5/4 groove, acoustic strings burbling on a bed of piano and drums and those sleepy harmonies leading the charge. Electric guitar freaks out low in the mix, setting the placid vibe ever-so-slightly off-balance. ""1000 8"" is practically intravenous pop-- it never jumps out and bites you, but the insistent rhythm leaves the sly melody in your head for hours, even after they assault the song's pastoralism with distortion that gives way to laser synth on the fade-out. ""Ruins"", meanwhile, is nimble backroads pop with an opening drum fill that hints at zydeco. Two late songs embody the band's weather affinity better than any others: ""Nova"", which pours down a hailstorm of guitar of the bridge, and ""Ol' Mountainsides"", a track that begins with eerie calm and climaxes with thunderous feedback. Of course, there are moments on the album where the band's subtlety backfires, leading to a handful of tracks such as ""Greenland"" and the organ-and-voice plodder ""Zero G"" that feel like filler. The mix fails to give proper weight to the vocals from time to time, as well, but these are minor issues when weighed against the full heft of the album. The Fast Rise & Fall of the South is quality Manx, never ostentatious but sure to captivate.","After a slight misstep, the N.C. band returns to the more languid, understated sound of its first two LPs.

Lights Out,Nat Baldwin,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a499b1335d7bf16989da/1:1/w_160/5bbe3f27.gif,2005-09-25 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1177-lights-out/,Broken Sparrow,"It may be the norm to pour out your feelings over an acoustic guitar, but that's not enough for Nat Baldwin: He sings over a double-bass, which he plays with raw, lonely intensity. At its worst, that bass evokes the beast that every scrawny, neatly kempt one of us feels in our guts when our soon-to-be-ex refuses to answer the phone. Lights Out, Baldwin's debut mini-album, feels like one desparate night alone, and if it were a minute longer it would be unbearable. A member of Newburyport, Massachusetts' Tigersaw, Baldwin regularly performs solo, and although this record uses some overdubs, it sounds live and intimate. Baldwin's croon-- a pure, clear tone with a discomforting waver-- evokes Thom Yorke's anxiety or Andrew Bird's eerier solo performances, and the album's ambience reminds me of Nina Nastasia's gothic Americana: Like Nastasia, Baldwin turns in a chamber performance that butts against the void. On the eight songs that he penned for Lights Out, Baldwin takes all-too-familiar impulses and stretches them to desparate conclusions. For example, the rote ""don't leave me"" lyrics of ""Goodbye"" come out as a primal moan, while his bow jolts against the strings like a highstrung heartbeat. Throughout the album, he tries to keep his vocals on an even keel as if he's just an observer to the intensity that comes out of the bass-- like he can step back and ask if this is what it's like to become a stalker. That keeps up through almost the entire 20 minutes, until the last song, a spent ditty that basically just gives you a minute to breathe. Although this is technically an EP, it feels complete, and exhausting. In fact, it makes me curious what Baldwin would do on a full-length record. Aside from a couple of guest singers, he performs this one alone, and it would be intriguing to see where he could go with a band-- or how he would sound across a wider emotional range. After all, he got through this album; what happens the next morning?","Gothic ambience á la Nina Nastasia and a croon worthy of Andrew Bird.

Home for Orphans,Reigning Sound,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3059d034d5c69bf2d1b/1:1/w_160/83fa24f0.jpg,2005-09-25 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6923-home-for-orphans/,Sympathy for the Record Industry,"The songs on former Memphians Reigning Sound's fourth album, a rarities comp called Home for Orphans, sound so familiar that you'd swear they're covers. Greg Cartwright has an ear for the hooks and hits from the mid-20th century, when rock, country, and r&b; were only just beginning to diverge, and his songs with the Reigning Sound have the authenticity of dusty 45s by long-forgotten artists, buried for decades in some lonely LP store or flea market. It helps that the band's recordings wear their lo-fi sound like period costume-- all tape hiss, tinny high-hat, and slightly reverbed vocals. To a certain extent, both Cartwright and his listeners share the knowledge that he's speaking a dead language, one that's out-of-step at a time when rock, country, and r&b; are largely compartmentalized and segregated. These outmoded musical references only amplify the desperation and resignation in the songs. Cartwright writes and sings with the conviction of someone for whom the ""sha la la la lee"" chorus of ""Pretty Girl"" perfectly expresses his disappointments in life, love, and music. ""It won't help you to keep pretending it'll be alright tomorrow,"" he sings on the doomed-love opener, ""Find Me Now"", his voice rising in mounting despair, ""when you know it won't be alright tomorrow."" On ""What Could I Do?"" he throws up his hands when another man creates a love triangle, and he lets his regrets simmer like roasting chestnuts on ""If Christmas Can't Bring You Home"". A few tracks on Home for Orphans actually are covers. In addition to the steamrolling live cut of the Breakers' ""Don't Send Me Flowers I Ain't Dead Yet"" that closes the album, a few of these songs originally appeared on the Reigning Sound's previous album, the aptly titled Too Much Guitar!, which buried the lyrics and melodies under six feet of dirty, frustrated guitars and asked listeners to excavate them over repeated listens. Home for Orphans digs them out, dusts them off, slows them down, and puts the vocals back on top, and only a little of their original vitality is lost. ""Medication Blues"" sheds its frenzy but gains a more legible humor as Cartwright admits, ""It's not that I don't want to work/ It's just that I don't want to fill out all the applications."" And beneath the skuzzy fuzz, both ""Love Is a Funny Thing"" and ""If You Can't Give Me Everything"" reveal sadsack odes to impossible love that match the ache in Cartwright's voice, which remains one of the best in rock today. In toning down the guitars and slowing down the tempos, the Reigning Sound have come full circle: Home for Orphans recalls the confident melodies and deceptively gentle sounds of their debut, Break Up Break Down, which was also released on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band has stripped down its sound to the very basic elements: Cartwright's prickly guitar, the Stax-tight rhythm section of Greg Roberson and Jeremy Scott, and thrumming organ courtesy of Alex Greene, who returns as a full band member. This set-up is of course an age-old combination, but within these constraints, the Reigning Sound finds a little bit of freedom to make the old sound heartbreakingly new.","Sympathy for the Record Industry band are a reminder of when rock, country, and r&b; were only just beginning to diverge.

Apologies to the Queen Mary,Wolf Parade,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaab5e6ef95969321617/1:1/w_160/f7d8f057.jpg,2005-09-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8794-apologies-to-the-queen-mary/,Sub Pop,"Considering the amount of pre-release talk surrounding Apologies to the Queen Mary, it's inevitable that reviews of Wolf Parade's debut will contain bad wolf puns, Modest Mouse references (Isaac Brock recorded much of the album), riffs on Montreal's music scene by those who couldn't locate the city on a map, and namechecks of the quartet's pals, the Arcade Fire and Frog Eyes. Amid the noise, what Apologies might not receive is the close listening it deserves. There's no question the lonesome crowded sound is here, but when Wolf Parade dig in and dust off their influences, the band rolls like a Ritalin-deprived power-Bowie or 70s Eno flexing piano-based hooks over Pixified rhythms. Component ingredients include electronics, keyboards, guitar, drums, and two spastically surging, forever tuneful vocalists (Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug), but there are also surprises: A theremin cries in the slow-poke ""Same Ghost Every Night""-- one of the longer tracks, it grows in pageantry as it swells to the six-minute mark-- and a spot of noise-guitar echoes throughout Krug's windy ""Dinner Bells"". And unlike most participants in indie rock's million-band march, Wolf Parade makes familiar elements mesh in special ways. Groups like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Arcade Fire inspire listeners to both feel their music and listen closely to what's being said. Wolf Parade's Boeckner and Krug sing so energetically it can be difficult transcribing, but as lyrics reveal themselves on multiple listens, Apologies is populated by ghosts, crumbled brick, haunted technology, Marcel Dzama animals, fathers and mothers, off-kilter love songs, rusted gold, and endtime/brand new world scenarios that furnish the album's ornate instrumentation and clever arrangements with an inspired if elliptical story arc. The album's roughly split between Boeckner and Krug, their tracks often alternating to a tee. But there is a non-cut/dry bleed between them, with both showing up on the same song, backing each other, screaming at the same time. I wouldn't want to inspire a quarterback controversy, but I tend to be a Krug man-- to my ear, he's the more intriguing lyricist, a Bowie-inflected guy tackling nonstandard song constructions. On the other hand, Boeckner is more traditionally palatable, which may make him the favorite by consensus: His work is often less unhinged or unpredictable, and this focus allows for some of the album's most immediate standouts. Apologies starts with Krug's mousy ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son""-- also included on the band's self-titled EP-- and Boeckner's ""Modern World"", but it really takes off with ""Grounds for Divorce"". Honing in on one of the album's main themes, the track finds a momentary beauty and romanticism within potentially alienating technology: ""You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground/ You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town/ I said, 'Pretend it's whales, keeping their voices down.'"" Spiraling behind Krug's vocals, Boeckner mingles his guitar splashes with textured keys and a distant shout of affirmation. Boeckner's best are the anthemic ""Shine a Light"" and his lovely, ragged closer, ""This Heart's on Fire"", which induces thoughts of the Boss in full grease-monkey Valentino mode. Krug's key tracks also come toward the album's end: the regal swagger of the Frog-Eyed ""Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts""-- note its absolutely sublime vocal cadences and group hug-- and ""I'll Believe in Anything"", one of my favorite tunes of the year. (Diehards can scope out an eviscerated take on Krug's Sunset Rubdown album, but in either hip-shaking form it's unexpectedly moving.) Tangy video-game synth, half-Moon drums, and pretty guitar reps embrace a maniacally charming Krug come-on: ""Give me your eyes, I need sunshine/ Your blood, your bones/ Your voice, and your ghost."" Boeckner's guitar distorts, the keys trill, Krug somehow finds even more energy in his pocket, and the fucker continues for another two-and-a-half blissful minutes with a shopping list of promises of escape and hope that culminates with: ""I'd take you where nobody knows you/ And nobody gives a damn either way."" On paper this all could sound average, but Wolf Parade's true talent is transforming the everyday into the unprecedented. Fittingly, then, the record isn't going to change the direction of modern music, but it will enrich small moments of your life-- lying in bed alone or with a loved one, the morning commute, the dancefloor, a house party. If you can, block out the baggage of its built-in hype machine and take this stuff for what it is. I still remember the excitement felt when I first heard Modest Mouse more than a decade ago. At the time, my friend and I talked about how it sounded like this or like that or whatever, but beneath the snobbery and geeky influence-detecting, we were excited, and so obviously into what the band was doing. If given the chance, Wolf Parade should engender similar scenarios: In a few years, other folks will still remember where they were when they first heard Apologies to the Queen Mary.

Excerpts From the Diary of Todd Zilla EP,Grandaddy,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf8e5e6ef959693233ff/1:1/w_160/2e897b5d.jpg,2005-09-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3549-excerpts-from-the-diary-of-todd-zilla-ep/,V2V2,"Who will finally put the lie to the Manifest Destiny? Notwithstanding our current New York-centric hipster circle-jerk, westward expansion was a defining myth of the hippie-dippie Baby Boomin' rock'n'roll gypsy show that ultimately spawned so much of what we now call Now That's What I Call Indie Pop, Vol. XIV. Yet no California frontier has more cruelly blindsided its pilgrims, from Okies to Mexicans to dangerously lost cork dorks, than Grandaddy's Central Valley. Latest offering Excerpts From the Diary of Todd Zilla suggests it's time for Grandaddy to leave Modesto to the exurbanites ('sOK, I grew up near Sacramento) and explore some new terrain. Recorded in eight-track at one of freshly beardless vocalist Jason Lytle's home studios, the new EP revisits the ruffled power-pop of 1997's Under the Western Freeway more than the computer-shocked Lipsedelia of 2000 paranoid-Kid-droid touchstone The Sophtware Slump or 2003's glossy Sumday. Indeed, Todd Zilla is a goofy, sloppy mini-album, cramming familiar Weezer fuzz, stoned piano ballads, playful analogue synths, and misguided Bad Company references into a little more than half an hour. Reportedly, none of the songs will recur on Grandaddy's fifth full-length, expected in aught-six. That makes Todd Z. tempting like a dollar menu, so too bad only perfunctory crunch-and-""ahh"" opener ""Pull the Curtains"" really rises above B-side caliber. Lytle sounds bored beneath his typical raised-glazed vox, and it shows. Much of the record is devoted to lambasting his current locale with cruise-control accompaniment: Piano ballad ""Fuck the Valley Fudge"" sticks it to the strip malls nursery-rhyme style, ""A Valley Son (Sparing)"" lets plaintive acoustic guitars and Venutian sworls do the whining, and another piano ballad, ""Cinderland"", spreads like a ravine for a shrugging/shrugworthy chorus. The songs are better when they're more ambivalent, like ""At My Post"", which laments failed attempts to leave town while flipping from sludgy space waltz to shuffling ob-la-di blah. Whistlin' campfire closer ""Goodbye?"" focuses on this indecision straight-on, but you gotta hope the answer will be more interesting than the question. Sure, the West is weird, but not much weirder than the rest of the country these days. ""There's more ATMs with air-conditioning/ Than there are birds on the wing,"" Lytle helpfully offers, providing a clunky everything-un-Zen Exhibit A for a venue change. I'm all for keeping it local, but even Fresno native Aaron Espinoza of Earlimart eventually found his way as far as Silverlake. Just please don't dally in ""Florida""; the EP's abortive emocore in-joke is barely OK to visit once, but you'd never want to live there. And yet: Go somewhere, brother, whether geographically, musically, or both.","On this goofy, sloppy mini-album, Grandaddy revisit the ruffled power-pop of their Under the Western Freeway.

Telescopic Eyes Glance the Future Sick,John Wilkes Booze,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3fc0084474cd0c27f4/1:1/w_160/4f80c323.jpg,2005-09-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4345-telescopic-eyes-glance-the-future-sick/,Kill Rock Stars,"Though their early EPs are tributes to unsung artists like Marc Bolan or Melvin Van Peebles, John Wilkes Booze will never be mistaken for their idols-- vocalist Seth Mahern's delivery is too anemic and weird to be anything but avant-garde. Unfortunately, his voice is too often the most interesting texture on their latest album, Telescopic Eyes Glance the Future Sick. The band's experimental excursions are compelling, but their strangeness isn't incorporated across the board. The rhythm section (including the Impossible Shapes' Chris Barth on bass) is consistently creative and sharp, but there aren't any riffs here a high-school pick-up band couldn't handle-- straightforward blues-rock with a hammer-on here, a seventh chord there. Small touches like the hair-tugging single-note bends in between the verses on ""War Drums"", the atonality under the riffs in ""Cultural Hurricane"" or ""Erasing Animals"", the arctic isolation in ""Gonna Die Tonight"", or the mildly unsettling spoken word call-and-response on ""The Rattler"" rattle expectations, but there are too few of these moments. Often, they're made to stand and face the corner while the guitars strut. Lengthier tracks like the formless two-note jam ""Can't Take It"" or the dubby drum circle of ""Heliocentric Views, Pt. 2"" are the exception to the rule. The revolutionary sentiments in Mahern's lyrics are just as banal (""Blowin' up the government was never so much fun,"" ""corporate images are burning your brain,"" ""the self-appointed king...will die""), but they capture something other revivalists often omit. Simple as they may be, they revere the idea that this music aspired to be a vehicle for change and dissent as well as a carefree good time. It's like John Wilkes Booze have dug up a time capsule and added their reflections on the present day-- uncertainty in the lyrics, chaos in the squalls of noise just behind the archaic licks-- before burying it again. It's a noble tribute, but not quite a resurrection.","Kill Rock Stars band combines revivalist rock and contemporary political dissent.

Swords,Lords,by: Cory D.

There was a time when punk, hardcore, metal, and rock were virtually miles apart. In the 80s, when all of those genres were going strong, the members of each scene treated theirs like a religion, and relating to, borrowing from or, frankly, enjoying any of the others were surefire ways to be subjected to ridicule and scorn. But as the years went on, new bands that sought to revitalize their genre found themselves blending styles. Punk and hardcore bands got faster and heavier until they were sidled right up against thrash and metal acts, who in turn were often turning to the classic rock of the past for renewed inspiration. By the late-90s, it had become commonplace to find longhairs at the punk shows, and mohawks had popped up on the heads of members of everyone from Anthrax to Warrant. It seems unlikely, then, that a band like Lords could've existed in any time other than their own. Had they released Swords 20 years ago, no one would've known what to do with it. Black Flag and Metallica fans alike would've spun the record, wondering why the time signature changed so much and where the guitar solos were, respectively. Lords' blitzkrieg approach-- this disc crams 13 songs into less than 20 minutes-- knows no boundaries, blending the raucous attitude of punk with the speed and fury of thrash, all topped of with the testosterone-and-beer fueled swagger of good, old-fashioned rock. The band hails from Louisville, known for its thriving punk and hardcore scene, and they made the jump from the long-standing Louisville label Initial Records to Jade Tree for Swords, their sophomore album. But anyone expecting that being label-mates with Pedro the Lion and the Promise Ring may have somehow softened Lords' approach should think again. Swords is brutal and intense, yet it avoids the darkness-and-gloom baggage that so many heavy bands carry around. In other words, this record is a hell of a lot of fun. The gates come crashing open with ""Stigmata Rite"", 1:38 of clobbering drums, wailing guitars and singer Chris Owens' domineering bark. For the most part, the duration of the disc continues in this unrelenting manner, but there are exceptions that further explore the myriad of influences the band is pulling from. ""Watching the Clock"" combines verses featuring low-mixed, muted guitar over quick bursts of high- hat, a bridge with rapid-fire, stuttering snare fills and a chorus that boils down to a convoluted barrage of amplified noise. Furthermore, ""Lift High the Mighty Throne"" takes the band's usual aggressiveness and throws in a swampy, bluesy swagger. Comparisons between Lords and other genre-blending metal bands will fall short: Unlike other bands, Lords aren't content with simply placing verses performed in one style alongside choruses from another, opting instead to throw it all into a menacing, razorblade-filled blender and stomping on the puree button.","It's on Jade Tree, but Lords' latest blends punk, hardcore, metal, and classic rock.

Run-DMC / King of Rock / Raising Hell / Tougher Than Leather,Run-D.M.C.,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d513d1975652138960/1:1/w_160/0e2ff9a0.jpg,2005-09-22 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11816-run-dmc-king-of-rock-raising-hell-tougher-than-leather/,ProfileProfile,"Here are some things about Run-DMC that you might already know: They were the first rap group to go gold, platinum, and multi-platinum, to perform on American Bandstand, to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone, to land in rotation on MTV, to endorse a sneaker, and to tour the country. Here's what that impressive list of accomplishments tells you about the group's music: just about nothing. It's hard to hear Run-DMC's music as music in 2005. For 20 years, their singles have been dorm-room staples like Hendrix and Marley; they danced with Steven Tyler on a hundred VH-1 video countdowns, their fedora-clad images have fossilized into pop consciousness. The group hasn't been relevant to rap in nearly 20 years; most of the music played on urban stations' old-school mixes comes from years after the group's peak. More importantly, the group spent the twilight of its career making embarrassing career move after embarrassing career move: performing at the VMAs with Kid Rock, endorsing Virgin Cola, releasing the god-awful 2001 failed-comeback album Crown Royal (featuring collaborations with douchebags like Fred Durst and the guy from Third Eye Blind), and performing at every college in the country again and again and again even though DMC's voice was clearly gone and Run had to help him with all his lines. Now that the group's first four albums are being reissued, it makes sense to ask whether they're worth buying, especially since multiple hits collections have already compiled their essential singles. The simple answer is no. Every one of these studio albums has filler, especially now that they've been loaded down with bonus tracks, and the excellent compilation Together Forever is still available at finer used record stores nationwide. But Run-DMC remains probably the most important group in rap history, and its albums deserve careful scrutiny, as historical documents and sometimes as more. The group's self-titled debut album, released in 1984, remains its most powerful and immediate studio record, the LP that forever tore rap away from disco and made it its own thing. Famously, the album's production removed all the glossy live-band funk popular on the rap records of the day and replaced it with a harsh, spacey stripped-down electronic boom. Album opener ""Hard Times"" is a good case in point: Producer Larry Smith lays down a spooky, chilly electro beat, nothing but a few drum-machine ticks and claps, some heavy breathing, a couple of synth stabs. Run and DMC toss lines back and forth in a tag-team style that never really caught on, yelling rather than flowing, building up to the end of the verse where they're both yelling in tandem. Lyrically, it's nothing special; their street reportage is just another take on their first single ""It's Like That"", which is itself a vanilla version of Melle Mel's rap on ""The Message"". But musically, it's spare and hard and densely compelling, and it probably sounded terrifying in 1984. The rest of the album sounds pretty much like this, hard empty beats with yelled old-school catchphrase-slinging rapping, and it's a strong and forceful time capsule from an era when rap's hardness came from its sound rather than its lyrics or its' practitioners' biographies. The only real misstep is ""Rock Box"", a track that buries a decent banger under layers of unbearable hair-metal guitar wheedling. The amazing early live track ""Here We Go (Live at the Funhouse)"", included on the reissue, proves that Run-DMC were actually better rappers onstage than they were in the studio, but then that track is already on Together Forever, as are five of the original album's nine tracks. So Run-DMC is pretty great, but you probably don't need to own it. King of Rock takes ""Rock Box"" as its starting-off point, adding a whole lot of heavy rock guitars to the group's musical palette. The new approach endeared the group to suburban America, but it meant that they'd never again capture the dystopian heaviness of their debut. Fortunately, they improve on the precedent of ""Rock Box"", finding more effective ways to throw rock into the mix. The title track rests on a huge, stomping AC/DC riff, and the two rappers sound pretty amazing yelling over it. ""Can You Rock It Like This"", with its 80s synth and glossy oriental plinks, could be a Duran Duran song until the rapping starts. This is effective stuff, but it lacks the sonic oneness of the debut and thus carries an exponentially lesser impact. The rapping hasn't gotten much better; they say it's ""never ever old school"" before biting Melle Mel again on the token social-message track. Today, their lyrics sound archaic to the point ridiculousness (""You're a funny-looking slop eating shish kabob/ You're the reason that my eyes are on the doorknob,"" ""Why don't you find a short pier and take a long walk?""). ""Roots, Rap, Reggae"" is a truly shitty and forced collaboration with Yellowman, and it captures absolutely none of what makes rap or dancehall great. The album offers little more than the still-thrilling rapping-over-guitars charge of the title track, but again: greatest hits. Raising Hell is generally considered to be the group's all-time classic, and it certainly has its share of classic moments. Rick Rubin had by this point taken over production from Larry Smith, and he kept the group's thunderous stomp while adding a host of sly sampled musical touches: unbelievably funky bells on ""Peter Piper"", a great cartoonish piano line on ""You Be Illin'"", a dirty Southern-rock guitar riff on the title track. Run and DMC had also stepped their rap game up; ""It's Tricky"" is basically as good as the two of them ever got, spitting quick-tongue witticisms and yelling booming threats with equal abandon. The album, however, has a ton of filler: the goofy human-beatbox jam ""Hit It Run"", the ridiculously tossed-off dis ""Dumb Girl"", the utterly blatant Slick Rick bite ""Perfection"". And ""Walk This Way"". ""Walk This Way"" totally fucking sucks, a weak and half-baked novelty-rap jam which got them (and Aerosmith) all over MTV but which sounds no better for having anticipated the commercial possibilities of rap-rock. That record was the group's commercial apex (it went triple platinum), but the band took too much time off after its release, spending a couple of years making a shitty movie and losing a court battle against its record label. During those couple of years, the landscape of rap changed completely; 1988 was the genre's quote-unquote Golden Age, and Run-DMC looked like relics next to young, more skilled rappers like Rakim and Big Daddy Kane and hungrier crews like Public Enemy and NWA. Tougher Than Leather found the group playing catch-up, enlisting a new producer in Davy D and rapping on the Marley Marl-ish breakbeats popular at the time rather than the booming drum machines that they'd always used. On tracks like ""They Call Us Run-DMC"" and ""Radio Station"", they sound confused and out-of-touch, kicking old-school applause lines over anemic drum breaks. They also revert to formula a few too many times, coming with tracks that essentially amount to sequels of previous hits: adding weird parental angst to the honking goofball punchlines of ""You Be Illin'"" on ""Papa Crazy"", awkwardly attempting to shoehorn breakbeats onto a ""King of Rock""-style banger on ""Soul to Rock and Roll"", biting Slick Rick again on ""Ragtime"". But parts of Tougher Than Leather are just great, especially ""Beats to the Rhyme"", which found Run and DMC quick-tongue rapping in tandem over an amazing state-of-the-art busy breakbeat with awesome sonar pings like Timbaland would use 10 years later. Tougher Than Leather is a failure, but it's a noble one. The reissue includes ""Christmas in Hollis"", maybe the first time they would allow themselves to become cartoon characters, kicking it with Santa, DMC chilling and cooling just like a snowman in a line that seems touchingly naïve in the Jeezy era. And that's it. Nobody is going to be reissuing the group's 1990 album Back From Hell anytime soon, and the group became an old-school signifier, someone for rappers to quote or reference but never hire for features or anything. The group was essentially irrelevant only five years after releasing its first single-- to put that in perspective, Bow Wow has been popular for a longer time. The group was hugely important in changing rap and making it an industry force, but you can't really say they had much influence on the way it sounds today. They removed the flash and gloss of the disco-rap of the Sugar Hill label, and they influenced a young LL Cool J, who influenced Boogie Down Productions and Eric B & Rakim, who influenced the Juice Crew and Public Enemy and NWA, and on and on and on, as rap would undergo sea change after sea change. By the late 90s, much of the music was flashier and glossier than it ever had been in the Sugar Hill era, and any changes that Run-DMC made were changed themselves to the point of being unrecognizable. And so what we have now are four historical documents, each with at least a handful of thrilling moments. And most of those thrilling moments are on Together Forever or other singles compilations, so unless you're a historian or a rich person, save your money.","Expanded reissues of the hip-hop legends' first four albums.

Siberia,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfbea9e61561daa7378/1:1/w_160/8ca695ca.jpg,2005-09-22 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2675-siberia/,Cooking Vinyl,"When Echo & the Bunnymen initially reunited in 1997, they seemed to make a concerted effort to bring their old, moody post-punk sound up to date with what was happening at the time. That year's Evergreen was a pretty decent record, but one that took a lot of cues from the Verve, Oasis, and Britpop's other masters of the big ballad. The 1999 follow-up What Are You Going to Do With Your Life? was Bunnymen lite, a band lost in the treacle of middle age, but since then they've really been striving to turn back the clock, if not all the way to the glory days of Porcupine and Heaven Up Here, then at least to ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"". 2001's Flowers sounded like a tamer sequel to Ocean Rain, and Siberia, the fourth studio installment from the reconvened band, sounds, well, like an even tamer sequel. The band is now down to a sunglasses-in-the-dark duo of Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant with hired guns to stand in for Les Pattinson and the late Pete de Freitas. Simon Finley and Peter Wilkinson do a dead-on impression of their forebears in concert, but these McCulloch/Sergeant compositions-- unlike the bulk of Echo's early work-- don't offer the rhythm section much to do. Wilkinson does throw down a pumping, Pattinson-style bass line on ""Parthenon Drive"", but that's the only real flash of rhythmic brilliance we're offered. It's no coincidence that it's also the most impressive song on the album-- the great bass part gives Sergeant his most interesting jumping-off point for his squirming lead guitar lines. Much more typical is ""All Because of You Days"", a mid-tempo slice of brood-rock slathered in Sergeant's pyrotechnics, and McCulloch's baritone, which he uses in a far more hushed fashion these days than he used to when he was wailing away on ""Rescue"" and ""The Cutter"". If McCulloch now sounds conspicuously like someone's dad it's probably because he is, and even if when dipping back into the well of dark psych, the age and weariness displayed on What Are You Going to Do... is still very much in evidence. In fact, for all the noisemaking that goes on in between, the album is bookended by a pair of songs that look back only lyrically, preferring a gentler musical approach. Opener ""Stormy Weather"" is a jangling piece of pop that largely eschews the guitar squalls suggested by its title, while closer ""What If We Are"" is the big piano ballad. ""Maybe I'm not the boy/ Maybe I'm not the man/ But what if I am/ What if I am/ Then it's love, yes it's love/ Like it should be..."" it goes on like that, and it's frankly one of the most boring songs the band has ever done, too stuck in the middle of the road to have the world-moving impact it seems to aspire to. If nothing else, Siberia proves McCulloch and Sergeant still have their songwriting craft in good working order, but it's hard to recommend an album on strength of craft alone-- it has to have a little verve, and unfortunately it's lacking. In the end, the band's retreat to the 80s falters because they can't find their way back.","McCulloch/Sergeant and their hired hands return with another set of dramatic pomp and guitar pop.

IV,Moistboyz,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a177b1335d7bf169827a/1:1/w_160/7b93d24d.jpg,2005-09-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5374-iv/,Sanctuary,"The press release for Moistboyz's previous album, III, has a number of illuminating things to say about the band, not least among them being, ""The Moistboyz know this will offend the androgyny of the modern person, and the young intellectual. The Moistboyz are holdouts in a nation of pussies and jerk-offs."" Since the Pitchfork readership is mainly comprised of modern androgynes, young intellectuals, pussies, and jerk-offs, it's safe to say that the only reason we're covering this record is because it's Dean Ween's cock-metal side project. And hey, don't be offended by this characterization of the Pitchfork audience; take it as a compliment: Add ""Europeans"" and ""fags"" to these pejoratives and you've got a pretty exhaustive list of things that anti-intellectuals use as shorthand to describe anyone goin' around all usin' their brains and stuff. So on first glance you'd have to be either incredibly stupid or terminally ironic to like this record. There is a third option, if those don't suit: There is a class of reasonably intelligent people that is attracted to all things willfully stupid and crude, a stance that seems to stem from a misconstrued notion of the value of transgression and a reaction against the intellectual posturing of academics. This is the portion of the population entirely responsible for Team America DVD sales, and Moistboyz IV is just one ""Fuck yeah!"" away from being its soundtrack. It sounds like the Hot Snakes trying to figure out whether they want to be Motörhead or the Scorpions, which isn't so bad. It's the lyrics that really grate, but if the slogans to be found on Urban Outfitters t-shirts are any indication, willful stupidity is still cool, so there's probably a market for it. Whether Moistboyz's gross-out schlock is earnest or satiric makes little difference: Either way, grim doings are afoot. It starts out okay, with three silly but entertaining anti-America screeds. ""I Don't Give a Fuck Where the Eagle Flies"", is pretty funny, and it's a damn sight better than the jingoistic John Ashcroft anthem it ripostes. ""Uncle Sam and Me"" celebrates the illusory power of rock in the face of fascism, with its snarled chorus of ""Don't take my rock and roll/ Because it's all I am"" offsetting its straightforwardly anti-patriotic verses. But by the time ""Roy"", the funny song about pedophilia rolls around, with ""Everybody'd Fucked Her"" hot on its heels, you start to miss Warrant, who at least had the class to obscure their misogyny with pastry metaphors, and Electric 6, whose self-skewering shtick sounded more like an indictment of the ugly American than a self-satisfied, anti-intellectual glorification of it.","Self-professed ""holdouts in a nation of pussies and jerk-offs.""

Dís,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0feb335119a49ec93c/1:1/w_160/df333c79.gif,2005-09-21 06:01:40,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4276-dis/,12 Tónar12 Tónar,"Composers are artists, but the word is also a job description. When Jóhann Jóhannsson of Iceland was commissioned to write the score for the 2004 film Dís, which he says, ""Captures quite well the zeitgeist of early 21st century Reykjavik,"" he sat down to create music to complement the images. He collaborated with members of various Icelandic bands including guitarist Hilmar Jensson and singer Ragheidur Gröndal but never bothered to ring his friends in the orchestra. Hearing this soundtrack I can't help thinking of Ennio Morricone, another composer who-- though he has a distinct style-- is willing to let his music proceed along functional lines. On almost every level Dís is completely different from Jóhannsson's last two records for Touch. Eschewing strings, horns, and cloud-drift pacing, Jóhannsson opts for a mixture of unassuming and bubbly electronic pop and delicate piano-based instrumentals. I said this record differs from Jóhannsson's work on almost every level, and the areas of overlap tell us a lot about his values as a composer. The common threads are Jóhannsson's airy use of space and the fundamental simplicity with which he approaches melody and arrangement. The repeating themes and motifs-- picking them out is always an enjoyable part of soundtrack listening-- are little tunes that would be easy to play with a couple fingers on a keyboard. Jóhannsson never uses five notes for a melody when four will do, and he's perfectly happy to let a piano with a wisp of processing do all the work when necessary. Some of this is up the job he was asked to do. Film music need only pose questions and it's up to the images to provide answers. While this can sometimes lead to soundtrack albums that seem incomplete, Jóhannsson's comfort with minimalism means Dís works quite well as a standalone album. Though capturing the 21st century zeitgeist was a stated goal, we're living in a retro age and Dís has unmistakable echoes of the past. Certain glitchy techniques seem an electronic development of the last five or six years, but the bulk of the record reflects sounds and attitudes from an earlier time. Wispy instrumentals like ""Efripides Og Nedripides"" and ""Thynnkudagur"" are particularly evocative of early synthesizer music like Cluster or Kraftwerk circa Ralf & Florian. Electronics then were still a novelty and using the machines to play a lovely well-constructed melody, maybe with a bit of piano thrown in, was comforting, a word easily applied to Jóhannsson's charming cues. The handful of upbeat pop numbers, on the other hand, have one string tied to the 80s. The guitar-led instrumental ""10 Rokkstig"" is like a slightly toned-down version of what Giorgio Moroder contributed to the Top Gun soundtrack, while the title track, sung by Gröndal, reminds me a bit of the Sundays. These refracted images of the past fit together to form the album's current of hazy nostalgia touched with a sense of yearning. As effective as it is, Dís can be almost too subtle for its own good, too willing to slip into the background where it will always sound appropriate. Perhaps that's the danger of functional music, though, which doesn't take away from how enjoyable a record this can be given proper focus. It's a taut and efficient collection that, while a departure from Jóhannsson's earlier work, is in its own way just as satisfying.","Composers are artists, but the word is also a job description.

Blank Field,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a855ea9e61561daa57cb/1:1/w_160/f1091903.gif,2005-09-21 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2098-blank-field/,Alien8,"In 2002, the nomadic Montreal electronic arts collective Champ Libre enlisted maverick composer Francisco López as musical curator for its multimedia ""Cité des Ondes"" event. For the occasion López assembled a formidable international roster of experimental sound artists that included such disparate talents as Japanese noise mainstay Merzbow, Australian avant-garde guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and Portland, Ore.-based sound sculptor Daniel Menche. Now López has edited and mixed Blank Field, a compilation of live performances from the event. And despite the inherent limitations of this decontextualized format, the collection proves to be a remarkable, frequently stupefying artifact that veers madly from one sonic extremity to another. Performed and recorded live at Montreal's Craig pumping station-- a structure built in 1887 to help control the floodwaters of the St. Lawrence River-- this music was created as just one aspect of a program that also showcased various electronic, architectural, and video art installations. In his own work, López has advocated an immersive listening environment, sometimes going as far as issuing blindfolds to his audience members in order to enhance their focus on the music. Here it's left unspecified whether or not these performances were originally accompanied by any other visual presentations, but nevertheless each of these outwardly diverse pieces share a certain sense of open-ended space that grants them a vaguely unfinished character, as if they're intended to be just another vibrant feature of an active urban landscape. The six solo artists represented here were selected by López for what he obliquely refers to as the ""physicalization"" of their sound, placing little importance on instrumental technique or process as they each formulate their own aural universe. First up is a relatively brief electronic track by France's Manon Anne Gillis, followed by a more prolonged piece from U.S.-based composer Michael Northam. These tracks are both finely textured sequences of tiny, enigmatic occurrences, with Northam's in particular making such extensive use of prolonged silence and barely-audible drones that if you've got a moderately busy household it's only through intense concentration that you'll be able to detect whether anything is happening at all. Things pick up considerably with Ambarchi's piece, an exquisite lattice of humming, gently plucked guitar tones that compares favorably to some of Loren Connor's most lyrical solo work. From there it's a rather abrupt segue into the digital anthill of Japan's Shunichiro Okada, who presents an itchy, beatless series of scrapes and buzzes with little regard for listener comfort. After that, prepare yourself to be deafened by the brutal one-two sucker punch of Merzbow and Menche, especially if you've still got your speakers cranked from trying to hear the Northam track. Though predictably noisy, Merzbow's contribution is actually a reasonably tempered affair, its grainy, unsettled lurch providing one of the collection's only instances of discernable rhythm. And Menche furnishes the album a fittingly radical capper with his droning symphonic swells and amplified organic contortions. Throughout it all, López does his best to create in these pieces some semblance of continuity, allowing each track to bleed into the next with a cinematic slow dissolve. But for the most part he has wisely chosen to leave himself out of the frame, realizing that it's the bewildering multiplicity of these distinctive voices that gives Blank Field its strange and potent juice.","Maverick composer Francisco López curated this album of international experimental sound artists, all originally presented as part of a multimedia installation.

"Shinola, Vol. 1",Ween,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9ee13d1975652139946/1:1/w_160/c4b0e0ec.jpg,2005-09-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8610-shinola-vol-1/,Chocodog,"Traditionally, an odds-and-sods collection presents two types of songs; the unabashedly experimental and genre-hoppity and stale, ersatz versions of previously released tracks. So where does that leave the first volume of Ween's Shinola B-sides collection? Ween's proudly sophomoric LPs shred through more genres than tracks with little in the sense of a signature sound. Thus, Shinola, Vol. 1 matches up nicely with more modest full-lengths like 12 Golden Country Greats or Quebec. While some of Shinola's tracks have circulated via the Internet and live bootlegs, none of them have appeared on a proper Ween release. Spanning from Pure Guava's crude four-track sound to White Pepper's full band approach, and with little liner information divulged, Shinola's tracks are difficult to date, though occasionally the music spills the beans plenty. ""Tastes Good on Th'Bun"" sounds like a crusty precursor to Chocolate and Cheese's ""Candi"" as the vocals get strung through a series of bizarre effects like meat through the grinder. Fuck-funk rocker ""Monique the Freak"" follows Ween's tradition of immaculate Prince spoofs, tempering the protracted horniness of the band's nine-minute classic ""L.M.L.Y.P."" into a PG-13 encomium of sexual prowess. Of course, most of the album consist of tracks too goofy even for a proper Ween release. With its campy jazz sax and fake audience, ""Israel"" sounds like a deleted scene from The Wedding Crashers, only with stranger, spoken word vocals. ""Boys Club"" rocks like a PBS jingle, good ole' fashioned jamboree strummin' and all, not to mention the perks: ""You can talk about the future, you can talk of the past/ You can grab yourself a nice piece of ass/ Boys Club!"" ""Big Fat Fuck"" stands as the cream of this toilet humor crop, touting a blubbery industrial bassline and robotic vox reminiscent of Brainiac (or is it the other way around?). However, all joking aside, Ween's best tracks here are those earnestly emulating the band's dearest influences. In less than four minutes, ""Gabrielle"" pulls off smart 1970s AOR better than today's cadre of retro rejects. Likewise, the cerebral ""Did You See Me?"" continues the band's long-time love affair with Pink Floyd, showcasing Ween at their most ambitious and vulnerable. Coming from a band that teeters at the edge of novelty, Shinola offers a surprising amount of flat out brilliant songwriting moments like these, particularly for a compilation of leftovers. This isn't a ""fans-only"" job either, as the assortment of these tracks encapsulate the band's catalog as accurately as a greatest hits album. Ultimately though, Shinola's potent track list further solidifies Ween's legendary productivity, proving them infinitely more complex than your average dick and fart joke.","Dean and Gene issue an odds-and-sods collection of previously unreleased archival material.

2012,Old Time Relijun,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bdea9e61561daa7065/1:1/w_160/f74d9a3e.jpg,2005-09-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5973-2012/,K,"2012 includes a snazzy split-screen live video performance of ""Cold Water"", a track from last year's Lost Light, along with its 12 tracks. It's a raw, unrestrained performance, and it's in stark contrast with much of 2012. A couple of notes of ascending sliding guitar start ""Los Angeles"" with a promise of catharsis that's deliberately held back. When Arrington de Dionyso spits out phonetically funky lines like ""from the ten-oh-one to the one-ten, to the ten to the two to the one,"" then wails ""traffic is at a standstill,"" it's evocative of the record at large, like bumper-to-pumper highway traffic where every driver's had one drink one too many. Holding something back reveals how strong this rhythm section is (now including Jamie Peterson of Deerhoof side project the Curtains) and proves once again the band are skilled and careful craftsman, not the faceless wailing of a second-rate Beefheart or Screamin' Jay Hawkins. 2012 lacks the accessibility of ""Cold Water"" or the rest of Lost Light, but it's another assertion of the band's particular talents. Opener ""Chemical Factory"" is a voyeuristic peek at a jam in progress, fading in on a stiff groove that's started before the listener hears it. The role of the guitar is de-emphasized, and the rhythm section becomes the rock around which other instruments drop in and out, like ""Chemical Factory""'s unhinged accordion performance. De Dionyso mutters mundane settings like a filthy invective, ""on the stove, on the table, in the office, in the lavatory."" 2012's concept about the impending apocalypse (which I'm told is predicted by the Mayan Long count calendar) fits: These performances are frayed, claustrophobic, and waiting for release. While other instruments are ubiquitous, like the band's growling saxophone or the mouth harp in ""Tundra"", the core of three can fill space on their own, like de Dionyso using the back of his throat for added percussion on ""Wolves and Wolverines"". ""Burial Mound"" might be the most threatening atmosphere Old Time Relijun has ever laid down, just from the relentless double bass and elemental force from the echoed slapping of the snares. The story from Lost Light (specifically the king) make a reappearance on that song and on ""The King of Lost Light (A Reprise)"", one of the album's most memorable tracks that builds complete chaos from the smallest elements: a one-note bassline, de Dionyso's double-panned vocal histrionics, and two simple guitar lines-- one vaguely eastern but atonal, one erratic two-note funk. ""The Blood and the Milk"" closes the record with an organ drone and a saxophone blurting so low it sounds like digeridoo until halfway though; one last shift from unpredictable noise to musical revelation.","Arrington de Dionyso and co. return with a frayed, claustrophobic concept album about the impending apocalypse.

The Weight Is a Gift,Nada Surf,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38fc0084474cd0c34ca/1:1/w_160/e16e4464.jpg,2005-09-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5696-the-weight-is-a-gift/,Barsuk,"Adulthood, ever a fat target for the snark-based community, shares an uneasy alliance with cliché. In almost every case, the mandates of maturity occasion an acceptance of the commonplace; out are Kerouac's ""fabulous roman candles exploding like spiders in the stars,"" replaced by duty and, eventually, mortality. No longer desperate to be unique, this kid imagines, we become merely ourselves. The remaining big truths are the universals. On fourth album The Weight Is a Gift, Nada Surf amble into impending senescence with hope, poise, and a similarly complex relationship toward the prosaic. The New York trio's 30-something members now bear dual millstones around their necks: Not just 1996 MTV Buzz Clip ""Popular"", but also the spacious, Death Cab for Cutie-influenced indie-pop of 2003 Barsuk debut Let Go. While The Weight Is a Gift lacks its predecessor's bird's-eye introspection and moments of near-sublimity, it's another often-compelling set of melancholic post-Coldplay guitar-pop, made grittily optimistic by the tribulations of post-hipster existence. It's these burdens that have set Nada Surf free. The band will never be accused of defying clichés, but it has survived on an ability to subtly add color to them. Where ""Popular"" was itself a bratty string of high-school stereotypes, the more modest success of Let Go served, if not to erase the truism ""one-hit wonder,"" at least to add a middle option. Yeah, ""Blonde on Blonde"" absconded with a better songwriter's poetry, but singer Matthew Caws' forlorn falsetto and graceful scene-setting made the loving theft believable; ""Inside of Love"" was pretty much what you'd expect, done better than we had any right to expect. The Weight Is a Gift is a sad album that acknowledges that, hey, maybe the bourgeois solecisms that flow so cheaply from others' lips really do have meaning-- and that gives it hope. Upbeat opener ""Concrete Bed"" tosses out itchy acoustic guitars and clunky rhymes like ""ossified""/""fried"" before building into a potentially laughable chorus, ""To find someone you love/ You gotta be someone you love."" Yet Caws' subject already knows this, he says, concluding, ""You've gotta call your own bluff."" Third track ""Always Love"" offers a similarly simple sentiment and acoustic guitars that unsurprisingly build into chunky power-pop. Here, too, however, Caws isn't just childishly mouthing something he's overheard; he's coming to terms with a voice he's ignored. The album's Northwest sheen also exists under shadow of the humdrum-- and serves as another proving ground for the underrated production of Death Cab guitarist Chris Walla, who helps give the straightforward tunes added scope and depth. His presence is particularly felt on the slowly humming, orchestral ""Your Legs Grow"", which appeared in different form on the Future Soundtrack for America comp. A track that could have been maudlin instead attains a simple beauty. Suffering is essential to The Weight Is a Gift, but mostly as a turning point in the rearview mirror of redemption. The album's essence is encapsulated on its best song, ""Do It Again"", which starts with funky (well, you know, for Nada Surf) bass and spiderwebs of distorted guitar. ""I spend all my energy staying upright,"" Caws sighs, begging for another go amid the ""azalea air"" and finally coming to the album's title revelation as cymbals crash and background vocals swell. Follow-ups have, to put it mildly, never been Nada Surf's forte. On The Weight Is a Gift, the band bears its cross and settles for a few quiet victories rather than a spectacular failure. Maybe I'm still young enough to hope that adulthood can be more surprising than this; ""All Is a Game"" never brushes aside the well-worn sentiment of its title or its adult-alternative environs, breakup song ""What Is Your Secret"" suffers from a lame movie metaphor, and dreamy ""Comes a Time"" fails to live up to its nods to Neil Young and Paris, Texas. Time has allowed Nada Surf to uncover the truth in the trite, but it has also eroded some of the band's personality. As much as I'd like to rep for the preeminence of song and restraint over typical indie look-at-me pseudo-avant-gardism, this isn't the occasion.","One-hit wonders continue to establish themselves as solid if unspectacular Barsuk tunesmiths, here with production help from Chris Walla.

Bryant Park Moratorium Rally (1969),Tony Conrad,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64a13d1975652139153/1:1/w_160/610cf7d5.jpg,2005-09-20 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1583-bryant-park-moratorium-rally-1969/,Table of the Elements,"In 1969, experimental composer and artist Tony Conrad was living in midtown Manhattan, just down 42nd street from Bryant Park. On October 15 of that year a rally was held in the park as part of the nationwide Moratorium protest against the Vietnam War, and Conrad, in a moment of inspired wit, began rolling audio tape in his loft. Directing one microphone out the window towards the rally, and another towards a television broadcasting live coverage of the event, Conrad was able to create this strange, often fascinating document by combining these parallel currents of media and reality. Containing a single, uninterrupted 50-minute chronicle of the day's events, Bryant Park Moratorium Rally bears more relation to Conrad's subsequent career as a video artist and media scholar (and SUNY-Buffalo professor) than to his work as a musician. Although the piece-- despite a constant barrage of car horns, police sirens and generalized crowd noise-- does reveal a certain hushed beauty in its steady, muffled tide of amassed human activity, this slice of audio verité could only be classified as music by the most indiscriminate avant-garde definition. On its most immediate level, the piece functions as an entertaining, occasionally instructive, cultural time capsule. Considering the circumstances and stakes, the rally itself often proves to be a markedly congenial affair. In addition to eloquent anti-war speeches from the likes of Eugene McCarthy and the Rev. William Sloan Coffin, the program also featured the rather inconsequential presence of a stageful of Broadway actors (""Miss Helen Hayes...Eli Wallach...Ben Gazzara!"") Meanwhile, the TV coverage includes brief interviews with such notables as Dick Cavett (interviewer: ""Do you believe in this Moratorium day program?"" Cavett: ""I think it's kind of been poorly defined what it's about."") and Woody Allen (""I think it's obviously proved already that it is working, has already worked, and will work even more as the next few days go by."") As illustrated by these various speeches and live interviews, one the most remarkable things about these recordings is the fact that the audio from the TV broadcast reaches Conrad's microphones sooner (and considerably more intelligibly) than the actual sounds produced outside his window. This delay not only creates a disorienting split between the album's dual channels, but also raises the rather uncomfortable notion that, at least from Conrad's vantage point, the Moratorium rally could be argued to have been more effectual as a media event than as a live one. Of course, the effects of this captured TV footage are amplified by the astonishing concentration of the newscast's live coverage, which consists of the type of continuous, uncut feed that is now essentially extinct-- outside of the odd C-SPAN broadcast-- in our current age of the 10-second sound byte. Far murkier, however, is the impact of Bryant Park Moratorium Rally as a political instrument. Conrad originally made this recording available as a free mp3 on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it's unclear what new insights this piece truly provides for today's listeners and/or activists. At a time when 24-hour news channels routinely feature on-air anchors sitting at their computers reading e-mails and blogs aloud, the idea that the media filters and distorts our political reality surely seems a rather obvious one. And though this record does provide an engaging window through which we can witness a crucial sliver of our recent history, it's a portal that grows smaller and cloudier with each successive listen.","Experimental composer's uninterrupted 50-minute chronicle of an October 1969 Manhattan protest rally-- both live and as it was covered by the TV media.

We're Already There,Mazarin,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f15e6ef95969323947/1:1/w_160/da83d189.jpg,2005-09-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5167-were-already-there/,I and Ear,"If Caribou is electro pretending to be indie rock, then Mazarin is its inverted reflection, and James Mercer is holding the mirror: We're Already There just might change Natalie Portman's life. To see the big picture, we can look to its composition: It starts with the clean, classic stencils of the melodies, older than God's big toe, but since a good melody never goes out of style, they still charm and soothe. An all-enveloping buffer of reverb serves for shading; producer Brian McTear got busy with the tortillion and blended those crisp melodic progressions into hazy chiaroscuro. Then out comes a pastel-smeared palette, and the blank spaces fill up with autoharps and analog synths, farfisa, and lap steel, the friggin' ocean for chrissakes. Yep, this is a big record, not quite over the top, but definitely peeking over the rim. The crisp, programmed drums bend Mazarin's sun-kissed guitar pop toward the Postal Service side of things, and those lustrous tintinnabulations ringing through the melodies? Trillin' like Calvin. ""The New American Apathy"" winds insistent sleigh bells around a hammering drum track, the distant bass melody boding something enormous about to clamber over the horizon, and then it does: With a dramatic introductory flourish, a bright guitar jangle arcs hugely over the tableau, the drums start to clap and jitter, and Quentin Stoltzfus unleashes a dulcet verse you know by heart from the first jubilant syllable. For real, it's hard to find a track on this record that isn't at once impressive in its craft and deeply lovable on a sensual level; you don't even need to skip around to sing its virtues, you can just go down the track list in order. ""For Energy Infinite"" displays the kind of melodic directness you either love or hate the Strokes for, a jagged pulse careening behind Stoltzfus's ""what me, rocking?"" vocals. ""Another One Goes By"" swoons with cascading autoharp and a melancholy beach-blanket guitar lead; ""At 12 to 6"" is an icy-hot inverted world; ""Schroed(er)/inger"" suffers from stupid punctuation but makes up for it twittering electro collage within. If there's a proverbial elephant in the room, it brought five pals, and we all know that an elephant never forgets. So while Mazarin might be too late to break bread with like-minded retro-popists from the future like Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel, they remember their lessons, from their unaccountable fondness for paisley to their Poundian directive to take old pop and ""make it new."" The result is a spangled, soaring indie pop record as winning and ambitious as anything else we're likely to wistfully smile over this year, and the hits just keep coming.","Philly vet Quentin Stoltzfus marries his sun-kissed guitar pop to crisp, programmed drums.

Shamelessly Exciting,Jason Forrest,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8bea9e61561daa78f0/1:1/w_160/c47bc1ce.jpg,2005-09-20 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3292-shamelessly-exciting/,Sonig,"In late 2005, we can examine the parabolic course of the mashup/bootleg craze, an early-century phenomenon both fueled and doused by the internet. In its beat-matching, genre-collapsing heyday, the best examples (think 2 Many DJs or ""A Stroke of Genius"") revealed previously un-thought-of connections between seemingly disparate material, deflating indie notions of superiority by revealing the pop undercurrent in their favorite anti-mainstream warriors. But after the market became glutted with any combination BPMs allowed, the mashup's appeal quickly dissipated. But as with most musical trends proclaimed dead by armchair analysts, mashups haven't really gone away, they've just evolved beyond the definition boundaries hastily set around them. In one way, they've returned to their ancestral home: DJ mixes that have been feeding off of unusual segues and loop constructions for decades. Yet simultaneously, there's been a progression of the form into new landscapes, beyond the simple combination of Beat X with Acapella Vocal Y, into more complex arrangements of previously released, recognizable, copyright-flaunting material. A healthy avenue for this progression is the willfully underground breakcore scene, made up of artists who often seem to be competing for the title of Most Abrasive. The movement's forefather Kid 606 may have steered the way with his The Action-Packed Mentalist Brings You the Fucking Jams album, and others have followed him into the breach, notably frenetic song-welders like Duran Duran Duran and more obscurantist chin-strokers like DJ/Rupture. Falling closer to the former group is Jason Forrest, née Donna Summer (but not that Donna Summer), whose '04 long-player The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post-Disco Crash re-imagined classic rock staples like Creedence Clearwater, the Who, and Elton John amidst skittering drumbeats and Michael Bay speed-editing. Unrelenting Songs was notable for its willingness to treat big '70s hits as open sources for loop-plundering, but struggled somewhat to shake the technique > song prejudices of Forrest's genre loyalties. Brief moments where innovation met listenability-- the ultimate guitar solo of ""180 Mar Ton"" or the shattered and reassembled ""Who Are You"" remix ""10 Amazing Years""-- hinted at a pop sensibility underneath the beat terrorism, kept frustratingly just out of reach. Shamelessly Exciting makes good on that promise, showcasing a Forrest just as ambitious in his use of samples while sanding down the sharper corners of his sound. Thus, a song called ""My 36 Favorite Punk Songs"" is exactly that, pieces of three dozen songs thrown on the ground and reshuffled like a game of musical 52 pickup. But rather than sounding like a jumbled mess, Forrest carefully mosaics the songs into the Ultimate Punk Song, scraps of the Ramones, the Clash, the Misfits, and many others bubbling up over the traditional 4/4 chug. ""War Photographer"" montages numerous passages of rock-soul brass (including the godly ""Spinning Wheel"" by Blood, Sweat & Tears) into an epic-sized Stax-ified ""Theme from Shaft"", while ""Dreaming and Remembering"" plunders the jazz section in a smooth strut that tries to dance-off Prefuse 73. Most of the samples here are less obvious than those used on Unrelenting Songs, memory-jarrers that tauntingly float just out of reach. The prog-organs and guitar-windmills of ""Dust Never Settles"" could be from any Boston, Kansas, or Styx record, though exactly which is impossible to place; ""Skyrocket Saturday"" merges bluesy solos with forgotten TV show themes, somehow begetting disco as a result. ""Evil Doesn't Exist Any More"" seems to use another swampy lick from the Creedence catalog, but before it can be properly labeled, the song morphs into an expansive Bollywood meets drum & bass crescendo that Tarantino has probably already earmarked for his next fight scene. Forrest even finds time to take an atmospheric breather on ""Nightclothes and Headphones"", with an assist from Laura Cantrell that wouldn't sound out of place on a Dido record, save a few extra rhythm skips and squiggles. The song may be far and away the closest Jason Forrest gets to traditional song formatting on Shamelessly Exciting, but its presence is indicative of the concessions towards accessibility that permeate the entire album. By remembering the pop elements of the source material he uses to construct his tracks, and incorporating that FM-dial ear for melody into even his most adventurous collage projects, Forrest takes the mashup form beyond gimmickry into an entirely new, refreshingly listenable, excitingly shameless realm.","Breakcore star makes good on the promise of his The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash, showcasing an ambitious use of samples while sanding down the sharper corners of his sound.

David Live / Stage,David Bowie,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a366c0084474cd0c0273/1:1/w_160/2f8e9a9c.jpg,2005-09-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11681-david-live-stage/,RykoRyko,"David Bowie is not a man one would expect to revel in the accidental. It is as much of a cliché to divine cold strategy in his every move as it is to pretend that strategy didn't exist for, say, Janis Joplin. For those preferring to see Bowie as a contortionist auto-Svengali, the main revelation of the reissued live albums David Live and Stage will be how unafraid of imperfections he could be. These panoramic snapshots of 1970s Bowie (David Live came out in 1974, with Stage following mere four years later) mostly sound-- surprise-- like a good rock band at work, not a collection of virtuoso day laborers supplicating at the feet of the Artiste. For one thing, the singing remains gloriously unsweetened, not by studio overdubs for the original release nor by digital trickery-- save a spit polish of the highs and fattening of the lows-- this time. Bowie's is not exactly a golden throat, but by the mid-70s he could will his untrained voice into a soulful squeal, a come-hither lounge croon, and so on; he misses some notes but never the dramatic pitch of the line. He also used to be one of those singers who need half a set to get entirely comfortable on stage, and, as a result, Disc Two of both David Live and Stage is the stronger one by far. If by the beginning of each concert, Bowie simply performs the songs, by the end he is twisting them into entirely new creatures. David Live contains arguably the all-time greatest display of Bowie's voice as he lets loose on an r&b; version of ""Rock'n'Roll Suicide"", festooned with James Brownian stops, croaks, pregnant pauses, and beat-chasing rephrasings, as well as a completely sudden detonation of a very, very high falsetto. Both albums start, predictably, with some selections from albums Bowie was promoting at the time-- Diamond Dogs and Heroes, respectively, before launching into a great big chunk of Ziggy Stardust. Interestingly enough, there are no overlaps here (name another '70s rock act that produced two 22-song concert sets in four years without repeating a single number), but an almost-complete live version of Ziggy can be put together by combining the two, if desired. In the battle of the openers, Stage wins-- the damp gloom of ""Warszawa"" easily trumps the glam doom of ""1984"". David Live is a more genial album, as its title indicates. It's loaded with Diamond Dogs material-- nobody's favorite Bowie album-- but works hard to ingratiate itself: there's ""Space Oddity"", ""Changes"", ""Jean Genie"", ""All The Young Dudes"". What a difference four years and a move to Berlin make: David of Stage doesn't appear to be the least bit concerned with what you'll think of it, or him. Recorded between Low and Lodger-- in the odd period that found the singer at his gauntest and most ashen-faced, listlessly flirting with Aryan imagery and ignoring the verse-chorus song form-- Stage is a challenging and idiosyncratic set. Some of the risks don't quite pay off: The cover of ""Alabama Song"" is just a bad idea through and through, its original Weillness matted with Jim Morrisson's greasy fingerprints. And some do-- the colossal trifecta of Station To Station's eponymous track, ""Stay"" and ""TVC 15"" comprise a powerful (and punishing) 20-minute concert-closing gambit. It's just like Bowie, of course, to make two mutually exclusive modes of engaging the arena-- as a party palace and as a horror-movie science lab-- fit together in a remarkably cohesive whole.",,7.7,
Certified,David Banner,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4985e6ef959693208e7/1:1/w_160/97dae74e.jpg,2005-09-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1176-certified/,InterscopeSRCInterscopeSRC,"David Banner is one of rap's most likeable figures, and also one of its most admirable. The consummate community activist this is a man who dispatched his own tour bus to relieve Katrina victims in Mississippi, fueling it with faith and a MasterCard...10 months after he chauffeured voters from his neighborhood to Election Day polls last November. As he told MTV during the announcement of a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert held by his youth network, Heal the Hood (healthehood.org), ""If I lie there and mope and don't get out there and be vocal, I'm really a detriment."" Banner has the same qualities Kanye West is lionized for-- his production skills are as distinct as his diction-- with the added priceless earnings of massive hood clout. But his contradiction would probably be a tougher sell to Time, even aprés-NBC commentary; to West's affable swagger, Banner offers murky nuance, no flinching, and a not-always-friendly-sounding, hulking bark. So even where Certified doesn't entirely congeal, Banner gets by on personality and an ever-sharpening focus-- and the man knows how to throw out a lede. Within the first few seconds of Mississippi: The Album, Banner'd pronounced he ""feel[s] the pain of slavery""; Certified opens with ""Lost Souls"", a mournful statement of purpose spat gruffly over guitar. ""This is for my thug niggas/ All the pimps and the drug dealas/ Thieves and the motherfuckin killas/ Most of y'ain't neva had shit/ That's why we get crunk in this bitch,"" the chorus goes, after which the nascent connect-the-dots sociology comes full-throttle: ""Daddy in the pen/ Mama out suckin' dick/ I ain't never had them/ So I ride with my click/ And I'd die for my click."" Banner's anguish and aggression is central. Never menace, though; beneath Banner's gruff veneer resides a borderline absurdist with unending charisma. He calls himself the ""weird o.g."" and on Certified he reconfirms it, with heart-rending quirky lines like, ""My love was novice like the left side on my controller of my Atari"" and ""I didn't wanna be cryin'...in front of our kids/ But we don't have none"" (both from ""Thinking of You"", a sad rap about a shorty squandered, a soul mate cheated away). And still, Banner is a man whose eyes, clear with the sting of misery, aim heavenward. The liner notes in Certified begin by quoting the Talmud, and end by mythologizing Banner's home state of Mississippi, also the namesake of his last two albums, as ""the place where pain lurked around every corner on the branches of every tall tree, and on the backs of my people...I was born out of that pain. Thank you."" Thus the sound of Certified, largely produced by Banner himself, is steeped in emotive acoustic guitar and fleshy electric solos, earmarking the South's musical legacy, fragments tumbling into its future of synth lines that squiggle like flickers of neon-- crunk, the thickness, the heat. At times the synth, acoustic thrum, and riffage intersect, particularly on the album finale ""Crossroads"", Banner's nod to the devil, Robert Johnson, mainstream alternative radio, and ""Amazing Grace"". It's a grinding, gym-socks-metal track ready to fermoozle ClearChannel by pantomiming Linkin Park but promising liberation; Banner laments, ""I wish I could call Jesus up on the phone like, 'Lord, still burnin' from the slave trade/ Can't reproduce cause our folks got AIDS."" Meanwhile its chorus promises, ""We were blind, now we see, in the end we will be free."" The concept is impressive, and beat-wise it's a flagpole stuck out in the heavy-metal green, demarking Banner's far-flung range as both producer and fan. But, as Banner fine-tunes his mostly dead-serious themes propped by adventurous beats, the rapper's bombast doesn't always cover for his inconsistencies, and sometimes Certified buckles under the breadth of his production. But then, bombast goes a long way-- see the stellar ""Ain't Got Nothin'"", co-starring Magic and Lil Boosie; ""Treat Me Like a Pimp"", featuring Jadakiss, his Northern counterpart in the crushed-glass-voice contest; and the Twista collaboration ""On Everything"", a football-field burner with the ubiquitous and ever-lovable marching band back-up. When Banner's on, he's on: ""I'm the new Nat Turner,"" he claims on ""Ridin'"". ""Spread something to the kids like Sojourner, man: the Truth."" Blam. Set atop a molasses chorus, guest rappers Dead Prez do his line justice with their trad anti-whitey, Panther-throwback Black Nationalist proclamations, though an over-syllabic, double-time verse by Talib Kweli stumbles. Which is also to say: Southern guest stars abound-- B.G., Marcus, Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball and MJG, Bun B, Gangsta Boo, his former Crooked Lettaz cohort Kamikaze-- in a chain of South-repping tracks interrupted only by ""Westside"", the weird but cute homage to Cali rappers and their legacy. Banner's bleak landscape is an eerie forewarning in a time when rappers have been more instrumental to the South's ""reconstruction,"" so Bush snakily put it, than FEMA. As Banner himself asked, ""How can a so-called 'gangsta rapper' react quicker to a crisis than our own government""? The answers are all over Certified, the South's first post-Katrina album. America: fuck yeah.","Mississippi rapper and producer's latest is informed by the South's rock and blues legacy, with guitar fragments tumbling into synth lines, its racial divide, and its humidity and heat.

Baba's Mountain,Apes,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0bfea9e61561daa4630/1:1/w_160/d636db3e.jpg,2005-09-19 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/220-babas-mountain/,Birdman,"The Apes make a strange and sludgy stew without the help of guitars, using the distorted low-end of bassist Erick Jackson and the mushroom-fed organs and moogs of Amanda Kleinman, while Paul Weil wails like a snake-oil salesman and drummer Jeff Schid holds it all down. The bass and organ are great textures in themselves, but Apes consistently pull it all together for a unique and surprisingly dense sound. With two albums and two EPs behind them, the Apes don't change their approach much on Baba's Mountain, but it is a more ambitious record, folding new rhythms, a few moments of calm, and more than a few moments of manipulated vocal weirdness into their smirking psychedelia. It's a little less similar to heavyweights like Black Sabbath and more like Jesus Ape Superstar, especially on the organ-driven tracks such as ""The Green Bus"" or the sunny ""Ornaments and Windchimes"". Ape Amanda is flexing her muscles more, while Weil is along for the ride, echoing the themes that Kleinman outlines and just as quickly discards. Apes match their ambition on ""Imp Ahh"", the rhythm and melody shifting wildly while the band displays its usual swagger. Weil takes the reins on the melody and the chaos seems controlled when he's in command. Baba's Mountain still sounds more or less like Apes, but this is a band full of percussion instruments-- change the rhythm too often, you risk losing the listener. Songs that remain static, like the strutting bass line and smarmy vocal tics on ""What We Do Best"", leave a stronger impression. Without the band broadening their palette, you wouldn't have songs like ""The Zookeeper's Night Out"", where feral drumming and a cautious organ melody meet with a wall of face-melting fuzz bass, and ""Imp Ahh"" or ""Can U Handle This"" would be half as stunning without their fluid structure. However, Apes still sound best with their inimitable sound over a heavy, steady groove. Put ""What We Do Best"" against any other track here, and see which one you remember.","Guitar-less sludgy stew provided by the distorted low-end of the bass, organs and moogs, and wailing vocals.

Picks Us Apart,The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9fe9d034d5c69bf5359/1:1/w_160/8d367bfa.jpg,2005-09-19 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4258-picks-us-apart/,Absolutely Kosher,"The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up is a deceptively enticing name for a band specializing in schmaltzy gut-spilling over dadaist Death Cab arrangements. Then again, when histrionics are your thing and you're inextricably linked to a drama queen extraodinaire such as Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart, being upstaged is inevitable. Yet despite the perpetual malaise, the Oakland five-piece has parlayed their nihilism into two impressive LPs. Since a 2003 joint EP with the indie tear-jerkers, the Pile-Up's bleak sound is becoming too depressing to sustain itself, and Picks Us Apart lopsidedly focuses on melancholia over music. Although formulaic, these guys have their sterilized take on Sunny Day Real Estate down pat. Paul Gonzenbach's listless demeanor manifests itself in equally colorless guitars and austere basslines-- basically emo in its rawest form. To no one's surprise, Ben Gibbard hails the band as his personal favorite, though fortunately they haven't exchanged their challenging sound for teeny bop fawning like Death Cab's new crossover-tailored approach. Of course, none of this instrumental stuff matters once Picks Us Apart starts rolling and Gonzenbach stoically sings along to a suicide note on ""A Toast to the Happy Couple"". In this opening track, Gonzenbach exudes despair, failure, and indignation in one fell swoop. Before you can say ""Sounds like Pedro the Lion!"", Gonzenbach drops the morbid line ""To my father...I leave a blood-stained mattress/ To my mother with her head to the wall/ I tried...but failed to do the simplest things that somehow mean the most."" After four more minutes of excruciating introspection, the persona concludes his letter with one final ""fuck you"" to the world: ""You are all hereby formally indicted."" Not exactly the most riveting opener, the song hangs like an albatross, and the album never really recovers. ""Silver Sparkler"" sports a nifty bassline reminiscent of early-90s lo-fi, though it repeats till exhaustion. Likewise, ""Heart My Home"" shines as the lone ballad amidst an array of homogenous slow-rockers, but sadly Gonzenbach fails to reproduce anything equally beautiful yet straightforward. Fortunately, the Pile-Up's unwavering consistency does damage control for this suicide pact of an album. Some of the more sprawling numbers evoke early Interpol EPs as droning, reverberating riffs are in no short supply. Still, Gonzenbach's funeral party doesn't seem to do justice to its own gravitas. When Jamie Stewart screams about chopping his own head off, he means business. In contrast, Gonzenbach's deadpan delivery has the emotional directness of an embittered AOL conversation and the lasting appeal of MSN Instant Messenger, making these spotlighted vocals all the more puzzling on an otherwise solid album.","Latest album from Ben Gibbard's favorite emo band.

Hit the Floor!,You Say Party,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab255e6ef959693216d9/1:1/w_160/4e8e5937.jpg,2005-09-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8918-hit-the-floor/,Sound Document,"By their very nature, British Columbia band You Say Party! We Say Die! seem reductive. Who's to say that hedonism and destruction are the only alternatives-- or that they're mutually exclusive? Fusing the leftist party-punk of Le Tigre with the dark, militant dramatics of Pretty Girls Make Graves, full-length debut Hit the Floor! neatly strips punk rock and politics alike (one and the same, really) to just get with the beat-- or get beaten. Exclamation point, exclamation point. Synthesizer! Nocturnal guitar stabs, mournful harmonies, dance-mother-fucker bass, and clanging hardcore beats advance the band's agenda of overthrowing, well, something. YSP!WSD! has a knack for emphatic codas that all but slip its agitprop past the brain's trusting hook receptors. Singer Becky Minkovic's voice exudes a horn-rimmed idealism that charms even as she shouts breathlessly for violence. ""We're gonna take 'em down in numbers one by one!"" Minkovic repeats on ""The Gap (Between the Rich and the Poor)"" as it surges into a bridge fit for a riot or a noise violation, then sighs, ""All we want is for things to be fair."" As a generational rallying cry, not quite ""No one here gets out alive,"" is it? All the better. The instruments still dip into martial call-and-response. The opening instrumental and final hidden track bookend the album with synth-washed apocalypse-- explosions, flames crackling, clocks pealing-- but first this band's painting the town red. Indeed, the object is less Poli Sci discussion-section and more full-body participation. The physical realm looms large both musically and lyrically, from the yawpy, hand-clapping pogo-punk of ""Cold Hands! Hot Bodies!"" to the spinning, dipping ""Midnight Snack"" and ""Stockholm Syndrome Part One"" in all its skin-and-bones frenzy. The bouncy multi-part pop of ""You Did It!"" could pass for Architecture in Helsinki, goofily cheering, ""Now throw away your pack of lies!"" The band's politics-- personal and otherwise-- and its punk are ultimately about self-determination: ""I will follow me,"" Minkovic proclaims at the end of ""Stockholm Syndrome Part Two"". Of course, what's inside the body has a beat, too. ""Hold it in your chest,"" she chimes on you-say-die-another-day hopscotcher ""He! She! You! Me! They! Us! OK!"" The songs are all better than their titles, I swear. Still, beneath the oddly thrilling over-the-counter leftism and patchwork punk, YSP!WSD may be a sensitive band waiting to reveal itself. Translucent mid-tempo anthem ""Don't Wait Up"" unfolds like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' heartbreaker ""Maps"", right down to waiting and breakup-precipice subject matter. ""Can't let my head believe what my heart already has received,"" Minkovic pronounces wispily, eventually building into another sloganeering coda: ""I'm your truth/ You be dare."" On ""Midnight Snack"", she pledges to ""build a moment out of feathers"" for a tired lover, toeing the line between vulgar sentimentality and soaring romanticism like a certain Pretty Girls Make Graves namesake (Steven, not Jack). So too the hidden track, which lays a timeless, vocoderrific mortal sentiment over a bed of synths: ""It's our last night on Earth/ Let's be together."" Turns out dance parties and revolutionary politics are easy; love is the big exclamation point exclamation point period. Question mark.","British Columbia band fuses the leftist party-punk of Le Tigre with the dark, militant dramatics of Pretty Girls Make Graves.

Self Destruction,Excepter,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfb13d197565213b440/1:1/w_160/109441ac.gif,2005-09-19 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2914-self-destruction/,Fusetron,"I downloaded a few house tracks the other day on the recommendation of one of the Euro shop/distributor sites (concise and efficiently presented, of course), and noticed rampant usage of the word ""minimal"" as a positive qualifier. In this sect of music retail, everything from minimal pop to ""minimal techno banger"" to ""functional minimalism"" is esteemed. I couldn't find any negative references of the word minimal, and I wondered if, in this environment, it was possible to tag anything minimal and not simultaneously be giving it a compliment. Of course, I read this at a merchant website, so not finding much in the way of objective critique isn't surprising. Nevertheless, I forged ahead. Next, I googled Pitchfork's very own review archives for the word. Okay, so the first thing I found was my review of a techno single, so that doesn't count. The next one was Philip Shelburne's excellent ""The Month in Techno"" column from August, wherein he asked, ""Can we please stop calling Cologne techno 'minimal'?"" His point was that in the scheme of hip, new techno, a lot of what gets called minimal isn't actually all that minimal. Next, I found Mark Richardson asking ""how minimal is too minimal?"" suggesting that there really is a limit to how much (or little) minimalism we can stand. Later, he goes on to criticize the music as ""flat and one-dimensional"", and thus provides a decent benchmark for this: When you get down to one dimension, you've gone too far. The problem is that the ""less is more"" concept in music is trickier than it looks. On Excepter's Self Destruction, I imagine some effort was made to quantize a sound that had theretofore been notable mostly because it seemed almost totally immune to imposed organization. The Brooklyn outfit, headed by John Fell Ryan, drifted spectrally through the same cosmic ether as neighbors Black Dice on occasion, playing ""noise"" that dove headfirst into modernist (and post-modernist) arenas of mechanization and detachment-- from the rest of the noise-improv underground, if from nowhere else-- even while it was psychedelic in the extreme. I would have had a hard time picking out minimalism in previous records KA and Throne, and though I was interested from the moment I heard they'd made a ""house"" record, I'm not sure I hear it here either. But then house isn't the same thing as minimalism, though they share some ideas (like how to use repetition to best effect). Yet, Self Destruction confuses me: If this is a house record, where are the climaxes and releases? The gradual builds and subtle modulations? The beats?? As it happens, there are beats to be found here, but they're uniformly small, brittle, and possibly Casio-generated. Even then, I'd like to give them credit for turning workaday house drama on its head with dry, impersonal sounds, but I think that rather than make a house record, they've made a haphazardly minimal one. Rather than paint from a grid using colors from another world, they've simply reduced the number of colors they use and painted freehand geometrical objects. To Excepter's credit, Self Destruction is billed as a house record in name only, apparently inspired more in spirit by the genre than in ""realized form"". That translates to a pretty liberal usage of, well, everything-- which has always seemed part of the Excepter M.O. ""Shoot Me First"" begins as electric sting synth and human barks at the moon, occasionally punctuated by falling stars and electro-drum pads. As moaning voices are added and the disparate tones cut into each other for screen time, the song shares much with past Excepter music. However, there are subtle differences: The sound is cleaner (probably due to this album being the band's first to feature multi-track recording and mixing), there's a lot less reverb than usual, and the general mood is less claustrophobic, more bluntly dissonant. It's as if you took a wet-dry vac to one of Excepter's spongy pieces, and sucked all the liquid out, leaving just a dry, porous mass. ""Bad Vibration"" is similarly anemic, but uses a steady, pulsating drum machine tambourine to keep things moving, and a subterranean, almost submerged bass line, sounding as if blasted from an underwater cave. Ryan's lead vocal/tripping mumble is pretty out-in-front, as Excepter songs go, though is none the sturdier for it. Even surfing over the rhythmic ebb and flow, it's still a pretty queasy ""melody,"" though aided by the hazy, brooding vibe of the track, it imparts a whole range of confusion, fatalism and solemn dementia. Likewise, ""BB+B (For 2b/2c)"" uses a steady beat (midtempo and hip electro, but rudimentary) and vocals to make ghostly dance music, but here seems reigned in rather than reformed. It's not that the beats are bad, per se; rather, they're transparent, as if the lo-fi instrumentation that went into the mixing board got the better of the house concept. The vocals again seem called in from another planet, but aren't enough to keep me from falling through the holes in the architecture of the piece as a whole. Still, when Self Destruction works, it works well. ""Interplay: Lock Room"" and ""Interplay: Your House""-- surely the most bizarre husband-wife (Caitlin Cook and Calder Martin) duets ever-- features house-esque arrangement of 808 tambourine, cowbell and handclaps, alongside Cook's alto calls, and even a recurring, harmonized synth line that almost lulls me into the idea I'm listening to actual dance music. The end of ""Your House"" falls off the piece like water retreating from the beach, back into the sea; the lone vocal evaporates and dark, metallic synth sparkles dim out into nothing. If KA was meditations on chaos, this is more nihilistic, and accepting of the void. But I'm cool with that. Better to minimize the arrangement than the emotional truth, regardless of where it takes you. ","Brooklyn band makes a self-professed house record, but do so with dry, impersonal sounds.

Awesomer,Blood on the Wall,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4975e6ef959693208e3/1:1/w_160/8b6b0a54.jpg,2005-09-19 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1175-awesomer/,Social Registry,"I readily admit these fuckers bite all your favorite bands, even more than the Serena Maneesh dudes I plugged a week or so ago. Granted Awesomer is more Dirty than Daydream Nation, more slanted than enchanted. So what's the big deal? Why Blood on the Wall, besides the fact they'll only cost you five points in Brent D's Indie Fantasy League? It took me a while to realize this, but whenever I throw on one of the aforementioned old guy records I'm always bummed how sterile they sound-- not nearly as noisy and savant as I remembered them. That's not to say Pavement haven't aged well. Really they've aged a bit too well. I want mold, I want putrefaction; all I get are mids and a jar of wet. Awesomer is a case of miscalculated personal nostalgia-- what, as of September 20, 2005, I thought the early 90s sounded like in the early 90s. I'm dead wrong, but I dig the fantasy. Dog days, not heat but humidity, sun-poisoned, teat-stroked naughty talks during adult swim, general embarrassment around the community pool because I wore shirts in the water and never passed the diving test-- those are my knees jerking to the labored tread, nic-happy trod of ""Stoner Jam"". Thirteen years ago, I'd have found some BBS-equivalent context to argue, wrongly, that Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind?"" wishes it had the nitro chorus and self-esteem of ""Mary Ellen""-- wishes it had something to believe in. ""I'd like to take you out tonight/ With your eyes clean and bright,"" sings bassist Courtney Shanks on ""I'd Like to Take You Out Tonight"", barely overpowering her brother Brad's velvet strums. If my Catholic grade school ass had known anything about real love, I totally would have put that song on Maria R.'s I-like-you mixtape instead of, jeez, ""Bullet in the Head"". Now my young hand is bare from all this grade school '92 talk, but one more thing. Especially after side two's string of punchy punk numbers-- scream-and-response bleecker ""Hey, Hey"", strung-out stooge ""Can You Hear Me"", nimbly plucked, possibly Smash Bros.-repping ""Get the Fuck Off My Cloud""-- what's clear is that BOTW don't build songs bottom-up so much as dream them big then sweat them down. Nothing's sparse, just concentrated, essential. Maybe BOTW vs. XYZ doesn't match White Stripes vs. XYZeppelin for quality, but the relationship's similar, and damn it all if the band doesn't just nail this gig in a few spots. Right, just like when you or ""your friend"" got up at the talent show and played Primus covers.","On their latest and best album, Blood on the Wall dream big by concentrating the sounds of indie touchstones such as Sonic Youth and Pavement into tightly packaged songs.

Set Free,American Analog Set,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07d5e6ef9596931ff6b/1:1/w_160/e1dcdb97.gif,2005-09-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/159-set-free/,Arts & Crafts,"American Analog Set are a predictable band. Buzzy organs, neo-motorik drum parts played with brushes, breathy vocals, guitars that riff so subtly they almost register subconsciously, Rhodes piano, occasional vibraphone-- these have been their hallmarks since the start, now incredibly more than 10 years ago. There has been gradual progress in the AmAnSet sound over the last decade as the songs slowly grew shorter, the rhythm section got a little spritelier, the compositions a little more focused. The most important thing about their sound, though, is that it's a genuine signature-- no one else really sounds like this, and their dogged consistency drives home how unique they are. Set Free is the band's sixth album, and if you're waiting for me to describe it, I already did in the first paragraph. This sounds pretty much like all the stuff that came before it, especially Know By Heart, but the strength of the material is decidedly more mixed. Opener ""Born on the Cusp"" is as fine a track as AmAnSet have recorded, kicking in with shy falsetto vocals, brushed snare on two and four, and a little Rhodes lapping at the edges. There's a little Motown-ish riff after the verse, and the band does a great job of building points of tension and crescendo in the arrangement through subtle manipulations of volume and density. Later, they almost rock on ""The Green Green Grass"", mixing in some backward guitar and very nearly distorting the rhythm guitar, but they follow quickly on with ""First of Four"", a speedy track that slides right back into their understatement comfort zone. These songs stand out simply for being the catchiest of the lot. There are a few that don't fare as well-- ""She's Half"" is something of a departure for the band, a mostly acoustic song that overuses an echo effect while pedaling in place. The middle of the album is indeed problematic, ebbing too far with three slow tracks that get boring all sequenced in a row like they are. And closer ""Fuck This...I'm Leaving"" is about as graceful as its title, lacking the rhythmic sinew that makes their best material so captivating. AmAnSet try some new textures, such as the melodica that lends a slightly sinister vibe to ""(Theme From) Everything Ends"", but there's nothing revelatory in the band's minor experiments, and certainly nothing that could be called a new direction. Newcomers should head to From Our Living Room to Yours or Know By Heart to hear the AmAnSet at its best. As for fans, Set Free is ultimately just another American Analog Set album-- and probably the least essential at that.","The doggedly consistent and singular American Analog Set offer another record of buzzy organs, neo-motorik drums played with brushes, breathy vocals, and Rhodes piano.

Druganaut EP,Black Mountain,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4795e6ef959693208a2/1:1/w_160/9674900c.jpg,2005-09-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1147-druganaut-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"Music you might expect to be addressed in this review that won't be: David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin. Predictable band that can't reasonably be elided: The Velvet Underground. Remember when everyone was talking about how much the Strokes sounded like the Velvet Underground, and you just couldn't hear it? Couldn't reconcile (maybe barring Julian Casablancas's dopesick drawl) the Strokes's concise packets with VU's sprawling quagmires? Chalk it up to a sort of parallax, VU appearing differently depending on where you stand: Casablancas was listening to ""White Light White Heat""; you were listening to ""Sister Ray"". Chances are good that Stephen McBean has also spent the bulk of his VU time trolling the murky 17-minute depths of ""Sister Ray"", if we can take his songwriting choices on this Black Mountain EP at face value. The rating's a tad lower than you might expect because this already slim four-song EP only contains one unreleased track, an acoustic version of Black Mountain's ""No Satisfaction"". We also get an extended version of ""Druganaut"" from the same album; ""Buffalo Swan"", the B-side of the Druganaut single; and ""Bicycle Man"", from a split seven-inch with Destroyer. Paucity of new material aside, the rock, as anyone familiar with Black Mountain's consistently winning LP might predict, is top-slot, unreconstructed vintage scuzz. Black Mountain is a good reminder that people were playing stoner rock long before the modern coinage debuted: Like VU, they play rock music suited to more dangerous, debilitating drugs than a Queens of the Stone Age fan's mid-grade hydro. Nowhere is Black Mountain's affinity for opiated murk more apparent than on this extended version of ""Druganaut"". Like drugs, rock music is a shortcut to a desired physical derangement, so the comparison isn't poetic license, and if a lot of modern rock focuses on the clench-jawed climax, ""Druganaut"" is the sloe-eyed, languorous comedown. Packed with terse repetition and understatedly virtuosic flourishes, this version gives you more time to sink beneath the dark surface of the song, a surface comprised of a handful of plodding chords, cavernous vocals, some buzzing synths and a few attention-getting peaks. But it's more about waves, ambiguously lapping, than concrete forms; a downer-fed bliss-out. ""Buffalo Swan"" is a similarly poky long-haul. Call it Black Palace: It sounds remarkably like Will Oldham's take on psych-rock might, especially the gloomy vocal, with a mid-section so squiggly and spaced out it might disintegrate without the mesmerizing rhythm track to keep it together. But by the end, the guitar finally wanders over to the bassline to cross the finish line in tandem. ""Bicycle Man"" implies that McBean's spent some time with the poppier side of VU as well, as he trades wails with Amber Webber over a peppy vamp, and ""No Satisfaction (Campfire Version)"" rollicks and rattles along like the Rolling St-- damn. I broke my promise.","Four-song EP rounds up alternate versions of album tracks, a B-side, and a track from a split 7"".

Eternal E: Gangsta Memorial Edition,Eazy-E,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd10ea9e61561daa761e/1:1/w_160/ca9ebfec.gif,2005-09-18 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2935-eternal-e-gangsta-memorial-edition/,EMIRuthlessPriority,"For a while, Eric Wright was just about the most despicable man in rap. He never produced a beat. He rarely wrote his own lyrics, daringly saying as much well before Diddy flossed his checkbook. He had a distinctive voice but a patchwork flow. He was the most vital architect of gangster shit, bane of the backpack. He stole from his own posse. He dealt far more misogyny to the masses than crack, but reveled in both. And he preached gunclapping as the apex of problem-solving. Like I said, a pretty vile guy. But holy shit is he eminently listenable. On this reissued and expanded compilation, we get a taste of a man with no vulnerability, no conscience, and a truckload of everlasting iconography. A former dope dealer, Eazy-E, dressed all in black L.A. Kings gear and dark shades and carrying an automatic rifle he'd never shot in his life, brought more to the future of virulent hip-hop than almost any other figure. In 1987, he teamed with nefariously depicted white dude Jerry Heller. They soon formed Ruthless Records and assembled N.W.A. Two years later, the group unleashed Straight Outta Compton, razing and raising the West Coast. His solo career is a less-traveled, oft-forgotten road, something many of the South's biggest, youngest burners swear by. I suppose it's difficult to ignore the rampant ho-cizing and gat-gripping that runs through every single song the diminutive Eazy ever recorded. At the root of the ""Whisper Song""'s bachanalia, I point you in the direction of Eazy, a man who regularly said things like ""Took her to the backroom, about to jack/ Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back."" This a guy who lauded sex at gun point. Cute, right? If there's something truly enthusiastic to be said for Eternal E it's the quaking, slithery power on the 11 Dr. Dre-produced joints here. A few years before he morphed into that shadowy monster he is now, Dre was just the smiley guy in black jeans spitting Cube's writtens and slashing Parliament and Charles Wright samples. Dre's early N.W.A. production, the skittish first third of his remarkable career, was rivaled only by the Bomb Squad, the Dust Brothers, and DJ Premier in cohesion and pure gliding funk. It was a natural fit for the energetic Eazy. His notoriously squeaky chirp was best utilized on story songs like MC Ren's ""Nobody Move"", ""Boyz-N-Tha-Hood"", and ""No More ?'s""-- all included here. The latter two were written by Ice Cube and it shows. Cube rarely got this lewd, but the vitriol is instantly recognizable. Eazy, a scoundrel, wore it well. Eight of the 17 tracks here, the eight best tracks, are culled from his seminal solo debut Eazy-Duz-It. Offerings from N.W.A.'s Efil4zaggin, like the crooned ""I'd Rather Fuck You"" and jovially revolting ""Automobile"" break up the hardened glares, but replace them with dickish goofing off. ""Real Motherfuckin G's"" is one of the most overlooked diss records ever recorded wherein Eazy asks Dr. Dre of his new protégé Snoop Dogg ""Tell me where the fuck ya found a anorexic rapper?"" The biggest flaw here is a tack-on with Eazy's son, Lil Eazy, natch, falling far from the tree on ""A Lil Eazier Said"". Eazy may be best remembered for revolutionizing the viability of the rap villain, facing off against the KKK, the FBI, his own bandmates, and White America. Whether Al Capone-ing his way through videos with a Tommy Gun (nine arrestingly shot and cinematic clips are included on a special DVD), staring down the po-po, or pointing out the booty shake, Eazy propagated a mentality that has survived, even thrived, today. Before dying of complications from AIDS in 1995, Ruthless Records had spawned hits from Above the Law, MC Ren, and most alarmingly Cleveland's Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, which is the true legacy of Eazy's uncanny entrepreneurial skills. His music still grooves, but it's tough getting behind cats who pistol-whip for head. Even the ones with good business sense.","Expanded and reissued compilation highlights the best from the late, nasal NWA star.

Tender Buttons,Broadcast,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a7c0084474cd0c02f7/1:1/w_160/4e49daf1.jpg,2005-09-18 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/948-tender-buttons/,Warp,"If you thought Haha Sound was a sonic mess, you might want to bring a Dust Buster with you for your first go with Tender Buttons. Where The Noise Made By People eagerly embraced listeners with its pastiche of groovy space-age bachelor pad couture and timeless pop songsmithery, Haha Sound was more standoffish at first blush. The tunes were there, but they were covered in a bit of soot. Those able to look past the static were rewarded; the clash between the off-putting sounds and the melodies created something greater. The same plan of attack is in place for this album. Only two folks were involved in the making of Tender Buttons-- vocalist Trish Keenan and bassist James Cargill. What the group lost in manpower, they more than make up for in racket. Keenan, as always, lends her gorgeous frigid voice to the proceedings, often two times (as on the lilting ballad ""Tears in the Typing Pool""). As for the music, Keenan and Cargill bring the melodies, but then dress their poptastic efforts with whatever ruckus they can conjure. It begins with the keening pings that kick off ""I Found The F"", and continues throughout. (For what it's worth, a kinder, gentler reprisal of the first track's melody ends the record.) The first single, ""America's Boy"", disguises its topicality in warbling, ghostly shrieks. ""Arc of a Journey"" chirps and skitters through its tunefulness for three minutes, then ends with a distorted and distended coda. Meanwhile, ""Corporeal"" decides to just throw in the raucous bits against the tune's Young Marble Giants-esque facade to see what sticks. This possibly comes off as a dour appraisal of this album, which I enjoy, and there a good reason for this. As noted earlier, Haha Sound went for the approach, and brought stronger tunes to the mix (cf. ""Colour Me In"", ""The Little Bell""). There's no such stand-out track on this album (and there's certainly no ""oh wow"" moments like ""Papercuts"" or ""Come On Let's Go"", either). What you have with Tender Buttons is a Broadcast album that listeners might need to spend more time with than expected. That said, this is still a Broadcast album, meaning it's one of the better things you'll put in your ear this year. Don't mind me if I reciprocate the album's tough love in equal measure.","Third album from Broadcast-- now downsized to a duo-- sees them dressing their poptastic efforts with whatever ruckus they can conjure.

The Novelist / Walking Without Effort,Richard Swift,by: Stephen M.

He penned all the songwriterly songs and wrote all the whimsical interludes on his first two mini-albums, The Novelist and Walking Without Effort, and handled engineering and artwork duties, and played most of the instruments. He even self-released both of them before signing with Secretly Canadian, which is collecting them as one release, immodestly subtitled The Richard Swift Collection, Vol. 1. That canonical title heralds more to come, and I wouldn't be surprised if he already has his next six albums written and recorded (in fact, his next is planned for early 2006). Just to bring these two records into existence requires a forceful willpower and an unflagging self-confidence, and for better or worse, the two albums reflect a serious perfectionist streak. The Novelist is the more distinctive of the two: as the title suggests, the album wears its concept on its sleeve, even spelling it out on the title track: ""I try to write a book each time I speak."" As if to conjure visions of the cardigan-wearing artist toiling at his trusty typewriter, Swift dolls up the songs in dapper pre-rock accessories that suggest a Roaring Twenties setting. ""Lady Day"" floats on a subdued samba and lofty vocals, ""Sadsong St."" features a ukulele, and ""Lovely Night"" is dark cabaret pop bristling with spiky clarinets. Yet for all the trappings, Swift sounds a little indistinct, like a straight Rufus Wainwright. That pop scion's entire identity is bound up in the musical styles he appropriates to express gay desire-- or re-appropriates, since many of these genres originally expressed gay desire. The Novelist never sounds like Swift has that immense an investment in these styles: they're just novelties. So by the mini-album's final chapter, the motif has grown superfluous and even tiresome. Fortunately, for *Walking Without Effort, Swift leaves the creaky prewar radio he's been singing from and takes a few steps toward the present day. Less self-consciously ambitious but more dramatically realized, *Walking Without Effort collects all the urbane lyrics and drawn-out choruses of The Novelist, but loses the glued-on razzmatazz. Sounding like both Jakob Dylan and Randy Newman, Swift seems much more at home among the 70s-pop guitars, Brian Wilson wood-block percussion, and Jon Brion reeds. He wastes no time proving his mettle on ""Half Lit"" and ""As I Go"", two diagonal rays of sunny pop whose horns and handclaps make their dark, desperate lyrics sound casual. Before closing with the refined valedictions of ""Not Wasting Time"" and ""Beautifulheart"", Swift hits his peak with ""Losing Sleep"", which handily achieves all of Swift's ambitions, not so much for its lush backing vocals or its sophisticated, crescendoing arrangement than for its elegant melody and heartfelt lyrics-- the two elements to anticipate most on the inevitable Vol. 2.","Secretly Canadian combines and reissues two self-released mini-albums from this promising bedroom auteur.

Underwater Cinematographer,The Most Serene Republic,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c367ea9e61561daa7eee/1:1/w_160/754e7560.jpg,2005-09-15 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5663-underwater-cinematographer/,Arts & Crafts,"Hand-me-down bands are well-known solely because their members are famous for being in other groups. Along with the regrettable Audioslaves and D12s of the world, this phenomenon often stretches to high and holy indie rock and, with their revolving cast of thousands, Broken Social Scene have proven to be a busy hive of (mostly decent) indie upstarts. But with nearly every BSS permutation exhausted, the collective is wisely looking outward to avoid a half-hearted hand-me-down folly. As the first non-BSS-associated signing to their Arts & Crafts label, the Most Serene Republic are an appealing, wide-eyed anti-hand-me-down sextet that may not have any concrete physical bloodlines to their crafty Canadian neighbors, but-- with their sweeping, climactic pop tendencies-- could easily sneak into a BSS family reunion and steal some BBQ'd prime ribs with few questions asked. They also risk the chance of being thrown out due to some distant-relation quirks and contrasts. Instead of the charming, shaggy stoner vibe that permeates most of the current A&C; catalog, Cinematographer shows off a nerdier, bookish quality. Along with an ambient, instrumental opening ""Prologue"" and closing ""Epilogue"", lead singer and trombonist Adrian Jewett has a thin, high-pitched delivery that sounds like an uber-stereotypical Trekkie singing latter-day Flaming Lips after one and a half Amstel Lights at the local suburban Toronto karaoke night. Live, Jewett's lanky frame sways awkwardly as he waves his hands around haphazardly, looking like an indie-pop sorcerer-wunderkind who takes pride in emptying the spit valve of his horn. The geekiness is palpable on record as well but the frontman largely avoids overt annoyance thanks to his bandmates, who conjure a string of twisty, atmospheric indie-pop ditties that sustain a polite-- if rarely astounding-- tunefulness. Awash in spacey keyboard effects and admirably varied, widescreen production, most songs go for big, emotional, full-band-chanting-something-meaningful payoffs but come up a tad short. Sometimes the problem involves too many instrumental ideas and vocal melodies packed into one track, inadvertently subverting its elusive eureka moment. ""Content Was My Favourite Color"" succumbs to this drawback as it combines speed-singing, a handclap breakdown, a vocal round, distorted breakbeats, and twinkle-time piano all within its 4:16-- consequently, the song is both impressive and frustrating. ""Where Cedar Nouns And Adverbs Walk"" has a weaker case of ADD and wisely homes in on the keyboard-bop that drives its second half, the band repeating a battle cry of ""I think we all know the words"" with increasing intensity. With all of the members of the Most Serene Republic around 20 (they cite Kid A as their official musical-mind-blow moment), they have an ample amount of time, energy, and bulletproof indie connections to push their ""who you know"" to ""what you know"" ratio even further into the right direction. If the group can manage to focus their youthful exuberance without losing their abundant spontaneity, their ambitions of becoming a true musical sovereign state could very well be realized.","Hand-me-down bands are well-known solely because their members are famous for being in other groups.

Symbol,Susumu Yokota,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab06c0084474cd0c12c9/1:1/w_160/95202e23.gif,2005-09-15 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8878-symbol/,Lo,"As time goes by and the albums pile up, Susumu Yokota's bedrock musical preoccupations have moved to the fore. Symbol, his latest album, is in a sense the finest encapsulation yet of his core aesthetic. It's not his best record (I am still partial to the restraint and austerity of Sakura), but is perhaps the clearest rendering yet of how he hears the world. Most of the sounds on Symbol come from sampled classical music. Choice bits from famous and not-so-famous pieces are plucked from history, placed alongside Yokota's synths and programmed drums, and looped incessantly to create a dreamy quasi-ambient fabric of sound. The sample credits stretch on like a Dust Brothers album but most of the pilfered have been dead for 100 years or more. Generally the sources lean toward the romantic. Favored throughout are the rich, swirling strings and piano from composers like Debussy, Ravel, and Tchaikovsky, and Yokota finds something pop in all of them. The wordless and ethereal female voice, a long established obsession of Yokota's, is also present. In addition to some original vocals several tracks incorporate samples of Meredith Monk, with her elastic tone veering from childlike whimsy to quasi-liturgical seriousness. Setting works by famous composers set to beats was a pretty sizable cottage industry in the late 1970s and early 80s, but Yokota's approach is far removed from Hooked on Classics. Rather than using long and familiar sections of pieces, Yokota taps into the emotional material embedded in the sounds of certain instruments and severely truncated melodic fragments. Many samples remain for me, a classical novice, just below the identifiable threshold, something I've heard before in another context but can't quite place. This works to the music's advantage, as it toys with memory and the associations inherent in certain types of sound without giving itself away completely. Obvious exceptions like the loop of Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" and swell of Mussorgsky's ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" stuck into ""Flaming Love and Destiny"" break the record's spell, but these are exceptions. It's an aesthetic that's easy to like, with a relentless prettiness so extreme at time it takes on an almost surreal quality. Something about Symbol says ""ecstasy album"" to me, with a mix and arrangements seem designed to highlight the music's considerable tactile qualities above all else. There's nothing life changing about Symbol but it's not that kind of record; ultimately it's a lush, ornate, and elegant celebration of the oft-maligned pleasure of pure surface-level beauty.","Bedroom composer compiles most of his latest release with classical music samples.

The Edge: David Axelrod At Capitol 1966-1970,David Axelrod,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a165b1335d7bf169824d/1:1/w_160/fd4e1d68.jpg,2005-09-15 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/392-the-edge-david-axelrod-at-capitol-1966-1970/,Blue Note,"If super-producer David Axelrod played professional basketball he'd probably have been ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich. Sometimes it's easy to mistake Axelrod's showy productions for bombastic and soulless affairs, much like Maravich's ill-regarded and ostentatious ball-handling. But also like Maravich, Axelrod used flash as a means to substance, not a substitute for it. His Capitol years, where he threaded the deep breakbeats of power drumming (typically courtesy the unshakeable Earl Palmer) with ornate orchestration, are akin to Pistol Pete's ridiculously unheralded four-year term at Louisiana State University. They scored at will and dazzled in the process. The Edge is an expertly selected compendium of Axelrod at his zenith, including obvious orchestral monsters like Lou Rawls' ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"" strapped next to lesser-heard gems like Letta Mbulu's literally stormy ""Pula Yetia"". The majority of the 17 tracks come from Axelrod's solo albums, particularly his first two William Blake-inspired works, Song of Innocence and Songs of Experience, essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop. These albums have literally been a rap producer's delight for years. ""The Human Abstract""'s morosely iridescent piano line was famously sampled by DJ Shadow on ""Midnight in a Perfect World"". Pete Rock cribbed from ""Smile"" for ""Strange Fruit"". Lord Finesse dipped in, too. Black Moon got to ""A Divine Image"" as well. How ""Holy Thursday"", the source for UNKLE's ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"" among more than 10 other songs each more obscure than the next, missed the cut is inscrutable. This wealth of sample-worthy material draws Axelrod's brilliance to light even further. Each element of his productions stood out, whether an obvious trumpet solo or the lowest-of-the-low key xylophone note. Axelrod was unafraid to walk near the lines of pretentiousness, too. Some songs, like ""The Signs, Part One"", from his hug-the-globe-cuz-you-love-it exploration Earth Rot, used haughty choral arrangements while others used the ever-trite spoken-word. Still, he makes each one work. Like the Pistol, Axelrod has been ripped off, in homage or not. John Stockton, another thin, white Utah Jazz guard got his game smarts and razor-sharp elbows from Maravich. Just as in the respectful and wizardly hands of Axelrod enthusiast Shadow, Axelrod's grace and power shines through. In a free-shooting whirling dervish like Allen Iverson, an obvious Maravich disciple, we see blazing talent but no brakes for the motor. Akin maybe to Dr. Dre, an Axelrod admirer who's been known to crank the bluster up a tad too much in the past. *The Edge closes on Cannonball Adderley's extended and tightly-laced ""Tensity"" a bold, buzzing 12-minute trip. The only artist to flip a sample from ""Tensity"" was rap duo the Beatnuts for a skit from their 1993 * Intoxicated Demons EP.

Noah's Ark,CocoRosie,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a700c0084474cd0c0ac3/1:1/w_160/1b39024e.gif,2005-09-15 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1757-noahs-ark/,Touch and Go,"On last year's La Maison de Mon Reve, sisters Bianca and Sierra Casady dreamt freely from a Parisian purview, traipsing idly from Haiti to St. Nicholas Ave. The lyrics were wildly surrealistic but obviously the product of minds blissfully unfettered, and the content was clearly informed by exotic experience. So dock no points for bourgeois enmity unless you're willing to do the same to all bands that make insular music, even when you approve of one's particular insular lifestyle. Instead, save the scythe for the kitschy styling, indolent performances, and hokey gags. That, and Noah's Ark is one of the most annoying records you're liable to remember. Freak-folk can be transparent, but it's also radiant with melody. Here we remove the rouge only to find dust, emaciated skeletons of songs that sound not so much played as exorcised. At least the gimmicky La Maison meant well. The itinerant duo was lost in a meditative ether, but the album stayed anchored to a place, somewhere around the 18th Arrondissement, Paris. Never been? Didn't matter. Chez Coco was candlelit and stocked with Strega and strange pills. Half-eaten acoustic strum streamed from porous hip-hop beats, achieving contradiction: dense flavor that washed down like air. ""Good Friday"" was a whisper of haunting beauty, the sibs retching their off-tune harmony just perfectly. Not even help from luminaries Antony and Devendra prevents Noah's Ark from coming totally unmoored. CR has abandoned its misguided love affair with delta blues, strapped on moon boots, and left Earth's orbit. The new vibe is extraterrestrial. ""The Sea Is Calm"" pits detuned player piano against disembodied voices and filthy bong bubbles. There's Banhart on the surprisingly percussive ""Brazilian Sun"", his voice garbled like almost every other sound on the record. ""Tekno Love Song,"" with its crushingly beautiful lullaby and yearning vox, comes closest to some recognizable humanity. But the gist is pretty gruesome, all hearse-drawn laments seething dyspeptic fumes, wormholed in from someplace terrifying. The lyrics don't get us anywhere, either. On ""K-Hole"" the Casadys graduate to the hard shit. Cool, but how's the comedown? ""Tiny spirit in a k-hole/ Bloated like soggy cereal/ God will come and wash away/Our tattoos and all the cocaine/ And all of the aborted babies/Will turn into bambies."" Inversely, no friggin' clue what I was supposed to have taken to enjoy this ride, but reentry was the best part.","Sisters Bianca and Sierra Casady remove the melody from their freak-folk, leaving emaciated skeletons of songs.

Odditorium or Warlords of Mars,The Dandy Warhols,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89cea9e61561daa586d/1:1/w_160/f082c0a0.jpg,2005-09-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2164-odditorium-or-warlords-of-mars/,Capitol,"Heroin may be passé, as the Dandy Warhols noted on 1997 semi-hit ""Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth"", but in rock culture, self-destruction never is. Nick Drake and Elliott Smith died blessedly dive-bar jukebox-bound, while Donovan and Smog rumble along in comparative obscurity. Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley never sang in a band called Audioslave. Sure, the case of Burning Out v. Fading Away is moot when it comes to assessing actual musical merit, but as precedent in the court of cred (gawd, remember that?) it's never been overturned. If last year's Sundance-approved documentary DiG! showed us anything about the Dandy Warhols, it's that these four psychedelic power-poppers from Portland, Oregon, are immaculately versed in the tenets of cred-conscious self-mythologizing. Throughout the film, the band's foil is San Francisco psych-rock outfit the Brian Jonestown Massacre, whose lead singer, Anton Newcombe, is portrayed as a tortured artist whose fiery genius ultimately consumes him. Dandies frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor, stingingly aware he lacks his hero's gifts, nevertheless mimics Newcombe's much-trodden rock-star antics-- heavy drug use, sociopathic tendencies, delusions of grandeur-- all the while stretching one foot ever further through the door to the commercial success that inevitably eludes Newcombe, like Gatsby's green light. Even the Warhols' early song titles (""Lou Weed"", ""Ride"", ""Cool as Kim Deal"") come off as signifiers of cred from a band desperate to attain what to Newcombe comes so naturally. Thus, given the chance to piggyback on DiG!'s success, the Dandies ask, ""What would a self-destructive genius do?""-- and promptly shoot themselves in both feet. The result, fifth album Odditorium or Warlords of Mars, looks like an attempt to rebut that movie's careerist image of the band, instead brandishing its sloppy difficulty like a severed ear. ""Don't get caught trying-- ever,"" Taylor-Taylor admonished in a recent interview. If the statement hits neatly upon the defining ethos of indie-rock in the 1990s, it fails to consider that songwriting and creativity, not just laziness and pot fumes, propelled the rise of slacker icons like Beck and Pavement. Only the truly earless would mistake this assortment of bloated in-jokes and interminable, sub-song drones for some kind of masterpiece. The whole thing smacks of effortful effortlessness, man. Odditorium lays its first claim to cracked brilliance through sheer, stultifying sprawl (oh, and that off-putting title). Listeners must first wade through a glaringly unfunny spoken-word opener, the inexplicably titled ""Colder Than the Coldest Winter Was Cold"". Then, on ""Love is the New Feel Awful"", Taylor-Taylor floats whispery vocals atop a chugging spaced-out groove for its first three-plus minutes; for the next six, it's aimless guitar mutilation, ""A Day in the Life"" orchestral squealing, and shrill free-jazz hornfuck. The next track, ""Easy"", is a more concise 7:32, but this time T2 mumbles his verses into morose oblivion. ""Holding Me Up"" recalls the fuzzed-out alt-pop of the band's first three albums, then hits repeat for another inessential three minute outro. The 12-minute, slow-motion krautrock hum of ""A Loan Tonight"" is as irredeemable as its title pun. ""Odditorium"" is what the Dandies call their studio; a good portion of its namesake should still be on the facility's floor. The same studied perversity also pervades the shorter songs. ""All the Money or the Simple Life Honey"", uptempo with ""Soul Man"" horns and rattling acoustic guitar, manages to spew both typical fame-sucks pablum (dudes, you're only the Dandy Warhols) and positively prehistoric anti-sellout raillery: ""You're playing in a rock 'n' roll band, but still you're doing whatever the Man says."" Pretty much the Dandies' half of DiG!, come to think of it. ""Down Like Disco"" jangles like ""Minnesoter"", from the band's 1997 Come Down, only sped-up Kanye-style, while unfortunate could-be indie-yuppie staple ""Everyone Is Totally Insane"" is the only time Odditorium echoes the hooky synth-pop of 2003's intermittently impressive Welcome to the Monkeyhouse. Hard-partying first single ""Smoke It"" feints Rolling Stones-ward until the familiar riff registers: Yup, that's the Hives ""Hate to Say I Told You So"". The piano-splashed one-chord mantra of ""There Is Only This Time"" (more horns, more Faust!) is mercifully capped at 4:40. True to form, the Dandies maintain plausible deniability about Odditorium's ostensible ambitions, always leaving open the Ann Coulter defense: If you don't like it, it was only a joke (you humorless sack of jihadist-spunk). First, there's the title again. Elsewhere, ""The New Country"" lodges a banjo firmly in its hipster-hoedown cheek. Dogs growl throughout sing-songy ""Did You Make a Song With Otis"", with lyrics about beer and ""Poopy"" tuning a guitar. And if the opener-- ""You're listening to a piece of history,"" A&E;'s Bill Kurtis pronounces in a rich Midwestern baritone-- doesn't exactly bring, well, any yucks, still Shirley it can't be serious, uh, right? A few jokes are overt, and uniformly excoriable: ""People got more baggage than JFK/ And I'm talking about the airport, man!"" And then there are the drugs. The Dandies still take a lot of them, kids. At least they want you to think they do, because they never shut up about them. ""Great pot,"" a man's voice proclaims at the end of ""Everyone Is Totally Insane""; ""I wanna get high,"" goes ""Down Like Disco"". Yeah, ""Smoke It"", OK, we get it. In DiG!, the Dandies show up for a photo shoot at a house the Brian Jonestown Massacre rented in Los Angeles, a house still trashed from a party the night before-- a party the Dandies didn't attend. Odditorium is an album of secondhand decadence, of hand-me-down self-destruction that the fleeting tunes can never support. At least the Dandies can say they didn't try. But that's an insult to everyone who ever did.","The Dandies get ambitious on their latest LP, mixing their typical studied perversity and sense of humor with sprawling, bloated tracks and in-jokes.

Yhä hämärää,Paavoharju,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a2c0084474cd0bfe5e/1:1/w_160/bdda2570.gif,2005-09-14 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6583-yha-hamaraa/,Fonal,"The back flap of Yhä hämärää captures a black interior squinting at green bushes. Framed by the room's torn sun-brightened curtains, small shapes spell out codes on the glass but it's hard to distinguish exactly what's leaving the dim traces. Paavoharju is just as enigmatic. The Finnish trio's yet to accrue much stateside press, and the lack of outside English-language material forces the reviewer to face the music like a blank slate, scratching nascent opinions onto what will hopefully become a larger dialogue. Ragnar Rock, Olli Ainala, and Lauri Ainala hail from the island town of Savonlinna. The ascetic born-again Christians recorded Yhä hämärää between 2001 and 2005, setting their Emersonian lyrics (all sung in Finnish) to a fluctuating electro-acoustic background that threads short-wave, field recordings, reggae beats, pinball sounds, sunken sea shanties, Sublime Frequencies radio scrambles, the somber choir of a backwoods congregation, operas made of cheap electronics, spectral female voices (with the occasional male bird song), chamber muses, midnight ambiance, and omnipresent crackles. If forced to choose a kindred Finnish group, Es' grave soundtracks would be closest in dusty elegance, but Paavoharju presents a more curious mixture-- a Fursaxa/Cocteau Twins B-Movie soundtrack, Sigur Rós locked in an underground cavern with Slowdive, or perhaps Syd Barrett jamming with Incredible String Band beneath a waterfall. The permutations are various: ""Valo tihkuu kaiken läpi"" (""Light trickles through everything"") merges hippie guitars, dippy drum machines, keyboard fritz, avalanching distortion crests, and Bollywood vocals. The lyrics deal with wind, waves, and spiritual replenishment or manifestation: ""The branch bows/ Skims the surface of the water/ Breaking my reflection/ Your image it reveals."" Then there's ""Kuu lohduttaa huolestuneita"" (""The moon comforts the troubled""), the phantom interior shot of a symphonic drowning. Like much of the album, ""Syvyys"" (""The deep"") feels as though it was recorded with water pipes running through its structures-- leaky, rusted veins. The track accrues the flavor of Edenic Noh Drama backed with a loose cable and distorted pong. ""Puhuri"" (""The Gust"") is a pile of pianos for Diamanda Galas to scat across with an electronic dragonfly. Its lyrics are beautifully puzzling: ""The crows shattered the sky with their song/ Children tearing tree lichen-- forgetting what was told/ After the gale that screamed while dying-- silence/ That conjures a fire on its arrival."" Nothing clots long enough on Yhä hämärää to be considered a tendency. When something seems familiar or you come to expect a certain type of programing, Paavoharju pitch a mossy curve ball. A poppy (or poppy-seed) strummer, ""Aamuauringon tuntuinen"" (""Felt like the morning sun"") has myriad guitars, faint percussion, and elegiac vocals working into translucent psychedelia. ""Kuljin kauas"" (""I travelled far"") is a mournful vision quest sung by one of the males; the guitar and crunky low-bit percussion are joined by a Snoop Dogg pitch-shifter (seriously) as the drum gets louder for the chorus. Here and there, a female voice trills behind the male. More upbeat is ""Musta katu"" (""Black street""), which uses reggae drums, music box fuzz, and more male vocals along with something that sounds like harpsichord with a creakier underside. The song's protagonist has walked along a black street to an inn where he gathers all the words and ""even picks up the ones fallen on the ground."" An inspired closer, the song's a jubilant charm. The band has stated that Yhä hämärää is an attempt to ""reflect inner landscapes"" and offers a list of ""highly inspiring places"" including ""graveyard, sewers, disco, the beach at redpoint, rooftops at night, alcoholic's home, churches, Uukuniemi, foggy fields, sauna, my bed."" This is a personal quest, and its hard to say if they succeeded, but Yhä hämärää possesses the magical giddiness of an unknown radio station tapped into momentarily while traveling unfamiliar back roads. When the signal bows out after the next hill, you're jolted back into the everyday, left only with the sounds of your own breathing, those other vehicles passing.","The back flap of Yh\xE4 h\xE4m\xE4r\xE4\xE4 captures a black interior squinting at\n\ green bushes ...

At the Center,Meat Beat Manifesto,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c410ea9e61561daa8076/1:1/w_160/0b8bb38f.jpg,2005-09-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5196-at-the-center/,Thirsty Ear,"Meat Beat Manifesto main man Jack Dangers has made a career out of continually being at the forefront of electronic music. From his early industrial-tinged material with then-collaborator Johnny Stevens, to explorations of trip-hop, house, jungle, dub, and beyond, Dangers has never remained in one place for too long. At the Center, his first full length of all-new material since 2002's RUOK?, continues the evolution by combining his signature break-beats and samples with jazz provided by flutist Peter Gordon, drummer Dave King, and keyboardist Craig Taborn. From start to finish, At the Center covers a wide range of moods. The disc begins with ""Wild"", a slow, slinking number that builds layers of breaking beats, flute, and organ. It slides almost seamlessly into ""Flute Thang"", which lives up to its name with extensive flute soloing over piano arpeggios and short guitar bursts. ""Bohemian Grove"" has a middle-eastern flair, with prominent sitar over string swells, while, ""United Nations Etc. Etc"" evokes Daft Punk with a muffled, bouncy bass line and twisting keyboard noodling. Finally, the disc's closer, ""Granulation 1"", is a creepy combination of haunting background surges and off-kilter piano, leaving the listener quite a distance from where he or she began. The album ambles on in an almost hypnotic fashion, sidling from track to track, switching between purely instrumental tracks and ambient soundscapes with vocal samples. Two such tracks, ""Want Ads One"" and ""Want Ads Two"", feature a comical voice-over reading want ads from a newspaper over atmospheric noise. The combination of styles creates balance, and it keeps the listener from getting too comfortable with the disc as a whole. The bulk of the album is jazz-fused, however, and the musicians play off of each other superbly, never stealing the spotlight, but never coming off as tacked on either. For this record, at least, Meat Beat Manifesto sounds as much like a band as a single musician, something Dangers has never really done before. The real strength of At the Center is just how contemporary it sounds. Dangers never succumbs to the temptation to phone it in, and he never relegates himself to simply giving in and playing generic pop music. For an artist to consistently push the envelope for over 15 years is a marvel, yet Meat Beat Manifesto can easily stand shoulder to shoulder with the current round of lap-top composers, most of whom are building off of his work in the first place.","Jack Dangers ambles on in an almost hypnotic fashion through modern electronic music.

A Ass Pocket of Whiskey,R.L. Burnside,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fcea9e61561daa4dd2/1:1/w_160/a76a5d87.jpg,2005-09-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1029-a-ass-pocket-of-whiskey/,MatadorMatador,"As a kid I went through long stretches where I bought records that I understood to be important to the development of rock music; so, inevitably, I had a protracted blues phase. There was something puzzling about this music, though, a discord between what I read and what I heard. In print I gathered that blues was fundamentally social; I was always reading something about the big names of the genre getting their start playing fish-fries, juke joints, and rent parties. From these descriptions blues sounded like party music designed to get people dancing, but the music I was hearing was for the most part slow, brooding, and personal, often performed by a single guitar and voice. Even with, say, Muddy Waters' full band and a faster tempo, I still couldn't imagine dancing to 12-bar. What kind of parties were we talking about? Somewhere along the line I acquired an album by Mississippi Fred McDowell called Somebody Keeps Calling Me, and, hearing ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and ""Drop Down Mama"" it all made sense. McDowell's guitar playing on these songs was all about rhythm, a distinctive syncopated chug that emphasized the offbeats and often stayed on a single chord. The structure seemed so much more open and inspired movement. This blues sounded like a party. Up near McDowell in the Mississippi hill country lived a man 22 years his junior named R.L. Burnside who heard his elder play and ultimately put his own spin on the stomping monochord vamp. Burnside recorded his share of solo acoustic 12-bar, but he'll be remembered for driving electric blues. He died recently. In the last 10 years of his life he enjoyed a modest amount of fame in the indie world due largely to this record, a 1996 collaboration with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion originally released on Matador. Burnside had already toured with the Blues Explosion by this point. When Spencer got the idea to cut a record, the band dispatched to an isolated spot in rural Mississippi with nothing but their equipment and what one imagines was a vast amount of booze. It's hard to imagine a more masculine scene: A half-dozen guys in a hunting cabin, drinking whiskey, cursing a blue streak, talking about women, and playing the kind of raunchy blues where ""I'd rather see you dead than with another man"" is as close as one gets to ""I love you."" No question A Ass Pocket of Whiskey has a fair amount of contextual baggage. Just the idea, a bunch of privileged indie rockers in the presence of a senior citizen performer from a different universe. So much opportunity for condescension and general bad faith. Even the sound of Spencer's voice, the man forever burdened by his background as a semiotics student at Brown, yelping words of encouragement every few bars (""Aw, yeah! R.L.! Snake drive!""). It's going to bug some people. Me, I think it works. More than anything Spencer's shouts remind me of Johnny Winter on Muddy Waters' comeback album Hard Again, the sound of an admirer in the presence of a hero, rallying him to hit the heights that originally brought the followers into his orbit. He knows he sounds like a dork. These guys, all of them, are having a ball. The band is loose but swings, the production is appropriately rough and leaking like a sieve, and the song selection draws from Burnside favorites. Listen to this take on ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and compare it to those on other Burnside records. The menace of the chords and behind-the-beat looseness of the drums can't be touched. That the Blues Explosion combed the entire Lower East Side in search of the perfect guitar/amp interface pays off. This record sounds like a blues album should. The entire record is filled with funky rhythms, even the weird spoken story-songs like ""The Criminal Inside Me"" and ""Tojo Told Hitler"" where the Blues Explosion comps while Burnside talks shit. It all feels thrown together, with tracks that begin mid-song and sudden exclamations that send the recording deep into the red. In this context the offhand nature is a plus. A Ass Pocket of Whiskey is smart and funny and full of life. Fine American music we can all be proud of, now back on Fat Possum where it belongs and where the final chapter of R.L. Burnside's life began.","Fat Possum reissues this collab between Jon Spencer and the recently deceased blues great.

Welcome to Jamrock,Damian Marley,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36913d197565213bd17/1:1/w_160/06e5f58c.jpg,2005-09-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5664-welcome-to-jamrock/,Interscope,"Damian Marley's single ""Welcome to Jamrock"" has towered over much of pop radio this summer, so it's not surprising that it towers over the album that shares its name. The song is a blast of righteous rage, Bob Marley's youngest son unleashing a towering, bulletproof torrent of abuse at the inequalities in his home country of Jamaica, singing about tourists ""on the beach with a few club sodas"" while kids kill each other a few miles away, all over a skeletal track of chest-slamming digital drums and synthetic skank. Songs like that don't come along often, so it's not a knock on Welcome to Jamrock to say it never approaches the power of its title cut. It would've made sense for Marley to attempt to recreate the song's blazing old-school one-drop roots fury throughout the album, but he opts instead to veer all over the musical map with about half the album barely sounding like reggae. The album's opener, ""Confrontation"", finds Marley in full-on prophet mode, singing, ""Any day, revolution might erupt/ And the skies over Kingston lighten up."" It seems like a fitting sequel to ""Jamrock"", except that it trades in that song's rootsy skank for synthetic martial drums and ominous, sawing soundtrack strings. Other tracks draw on the slick breakbeats and sampled funk-guitar stabs of late-80s new jack swing; it's not much of a surprise when Bobby Brown turns up halfway through the album. The expert sex jam ""All Night"" has a rolling throwback beat that could've come from Marley Marl in his prime. A handful of other songs are simply straight-up dancehall, weird coming from the guy who is supposedly at the forefront of reggae's move away from ragga; ""Hey Girl"" even sounds something like a laid-back take on T.O.K. (This is a good thing.) Refreshingly, Marley sounds very little like his father. He's got a strained, abrasive voice with very little in common with Bob's honeyed coo, and his Jamaican accent is so deep and thick that it's often hard for American ears to tell what he's saying. On ""Beautiful"", he namechecks his father alongside the smooth dancehall loverman Super Cat, and in his lighter moments, Marley sounds strikingly like the latter. But on the sad, gorgeous Nas duet ""Road to Zion"", his voice is a weary, lonely sigh reminiscent of Horace Andy. Marley only recalls his father once on ""We're Gonna Make It"", a lush, burbling, melodic old-school reggae track, a style that Marley simply can't do anywhere near as well as his father. Much more powerful is ""Move!"", a song that samples his father's ""Exodus"", adding rushing drums and quick-tongue chatting that become increasingly passionate and frantic as the song progresses. When the drums drop out and Bob's voice comes in on the chorus, it's breathtaking. But despite all its great moments, Jamrock doesn't hold together as an album; its constant stylistic switch-ups keep it from ever building into a whole. The missteps on the album are especially glaring. The Bobby Brown collaboration ""Beautiful"" is ruined by a cheesed-out smooth-jazz session-musician saxophone, while ""Pimpa's Paradise"" enlists the Roots' Black Thought for a boring, condescending woman-gone-astray lament. ""For the Babies"" is a pretty-enough ballad with an orientalist synth riff, but its lyrics are some pro-life bullshit that Pat Robertson would probably approve. And then there's the title track, a song so great that it dwarfs the rest of the album. Marley will be lucky if he ever equals it.","Roots revivalist unveils a surprisingly diverse album.

The Minstrel Show,Little Brother,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde9c0084474cd0c2dd5/1:1/w_160/73955a26.jpg,2005-09-14 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4989-the-minstrel-show/,AtlanticABB,"Hip-hop sucks. It must. Otherwise, Little Brother's battle cry of returning the art form to its rightful place makes less sense than it did nearly 10 years ago, when artists who weren't signed to a major label proclaimed them. So what is Little Brother saving hip-hop from? According to them, commercial artists' focus on sex, guns, and accessories are the modern-day equivalent of Vaudevillian blackface performers, seizing upon the worst characteristics of black society and hyperbolizing them to entertain a non-black audience. The proposed minstrelsy of hip-hop doesn't explain how the #1 album and single in the country come from a guy whose lyrics are more introspective than Conor Oberst's, whose biggest hit to date is about Jesus, and whose name is in everyone's mouth from suburbia to the White House because of his nationally-televised political stance. Is Kanye in blackface? Better yet, is Missy? Or Outkast? These aren't fringe performers. They are a few of the biggest selling pop artists of the last half-decade, all of whom enjoy widespread cultural influence and power. Little Brother imply that anyone who raps about anything other than ""real life"" [read: middle-class struggles] is a disgrace, a Pied Piper to the youth, a traitor to his or her culture who needs to be shown the path to redemption. Their stance also assumes that the listening audience isn't intelligent enough to distinguish between fact and fiction, reality from rented props. If Little Brother's product were as enticing as any of the artists they decry as sellouts, their message might carry more weight, but The Minstrel Show adds up to little more than a loose concept constructed on tiresome production so that the group can pound its ham-fisted homilies. The album's Minstrel Show is a fictional Saturday Night Live-type program televised on the UBN (U Black Niggas-- a revealing bit of finger-pointing) network, which provides the basis for the bounty of skits and jokes throughout. Some of the skits are funny at first listen, but the skit long ago became the wanky guitar solo of hip-hop. Save the skits and one stab at soft targets, R. Kelly and Ronald Isley, Little Brother make no attempt to adhere to the concept. Lyrically, Phonte and Big Pooh offer a variety of ""we're better than you"" battle rhymes but aren't bold enough to say why. If they're on a higher plane, it seems they could come up with a few clever metaphors explaining such, but no. On ""All For You"" they tackle the difficulties of fatherhood, but it's an all-too-brief blip of social consciousness. To his credit, Phonte is an intelligent lyricist, and when he isn't married to bad ideas, he shines, as on his Foreign Exchange album with Nicolay. And then there's 9th Wonder, whose production was supposed to change the game ever since the Roots' ?uestlove got a crush on Little Brother's early demos in 1999. The ever-graying cloud over 9th's beats is that they still sound like early demos. Despite being signed to a major and scoring scads of outside production work, 9th still sounds like he's tapping his fingers on a Best Buy synthesizer. His whispy snare hits have become so predictable you could sync your grandmother's treadmill to their rhythmic lethargy. And can we put an end to the neighborhood D'Angelo singing hooks on hip-hop records? 9th Wonder is proficient enough in selecting a soul sample and throttling the bassline that not everything is a dud (lead-single, ""Lovin' It"", ""Hiding Place"" featuring Elzhi, and ""Say It Again""). Little Brother have good intentions. They want to sound like the groups they grew up enjoying, namely A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Pete Rock & CL Smooth (they even homage ATCQ's ""Oh My God"" on ""Still Lives Through""), but their songs sound more like signifiers of those groups, not their logical descendents. Unfortunately, the hype that floated Little Brother's careers over the last six years may have affirmed some bad habits (narrow content, homemade beats) and encouraged lofty aspirations not yet attainable. If they want to create an alternative to the types of hip-hop they don't respect, they would do well to study the lessons of their favorite records.","Oft-heralded indie hip-hop group offer a loose concept album featuring throwback production and anti-mainstream rhymes.

Oh No,OK Go,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9adea9e61561daa7038/1:1/w_160/f1aab8ef.jpg,2005-09-13 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5958-oh-no/,Capitol,"My all-time favorite recording trope (excepting the ole' hidden trackeroo) has to be the album-opening staged rehearsal routine. The drummer practices some rolls, a buzzing input jack is plugged in, a firecracker goes off, and then somebody shouts ""1, 2, 3, 4!"", miraculously transmuting this rambunctious rehearsal into a clean-cut, impeccably sequenced full-length. Nearly every rock band's done it, and for the listener who really wants to connect, it's great playacting. Thus, in four seconds of fuzz and feedback, power-pop hucksters OK Go kick off their second LP with said theatrical flair and continue the charade for 13 rigid, self-conscious tracks. Mimicry is one thing, but at least choose wisely. You see, OK Go decide to impersonate post-Pinkerton, post-catchy, fun-by-numbers Weezer, resulting in an Ivy Leaguer Sugar Ray sound. Worse yet, they keep one thumb in whatever pie MTV currently deems popular. Their summery self-titled debut cashed in on the short-lived Phantom Planet/Rooney craze, and Oh No egregiously hangs on the new wave bandwagon like a barnacle. If that chunky, clumsy riff on single ""Do What You Want"" sounds familiar, it should. Producer Tore Johansson tries to inject dance-rock into Oh No, apparently using leftover scraps from his Franz Ferdinand sessions. Unfortunately, the infusion sticks out like a rejected kidney, and Johansson often concedes to OK Go's smarmy schlock rock. Frontman Damian Kulash calls most of the shots here, and not surprisingly, his frat boy spin on Elvis Costello shows marginal progress since ""You're So Damn Hot"". When he's not screaming ""come on!"" or ""hey!"", Kulash's razor wit tackles an array of subjects ranging from women to girls to chicks. His poetics may not run deep, but they certainly go on forever. Opener ""Invincible"", this album's ""Get Over It"", is meat-and-potatoes arena rock documenting Kulash's bizarre metaphor about a superhero girl who saves the world from aliens: ""When they finally come to destroy the earthÉthey won't know about the thousand Fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes."" Damian Kulash majored in semiotics at Brown University, just throwing that out there. So okay I get it, these guys are a ""fun"" band, and that's great, I love fun. Why, though, does their music play by such strict rules? Their only curveballs thrown here are Beach Boys harmonies and the same augmented chord progression, and even these twists are rationed. While their debut at least sported some guilty pleasure material, Oh No is too self-conscious for serious hooks to flourish. For what it's worth, Kulash still shows a nose for catchiness on humbler, mid-tempo songs, and without it, I wouldn't be touching this album with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole. From the impeccable touchstones to the knack for melody, everything's in place for these guys. However, as Oh No's first four seconds of guitar noodling forecast, these guys simply try too hard.","Oh, yes: It's the return of OK Go.

The Return of the Clerkenwell Kid,The Real Tuesday Weld,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a22013d19756521387c9/1:1/w_160/e0365f46.jpg,2005-09-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6704-the-return-of-the-clerkenwell-kid/,Six Degrees,"You may recall the Real Tuesday Weld as the sometimes-solo project of twee-as-feck Britfop Stephen Coates. (The really real Tuesday Weld is an Elvis-dating, Dudley Moore-divorcing pin-up turned Oscar nominee, but anyway that's not her real name.) After loosely basing 2004's excellent I, Lucifer on a Glen Duncan novel, Coates ballasts his latest Prohibition-era cocktail cruise with another loveboatload of conceits-- vague storyline, vaguer alter ego, and the ever-loved love/death dichotomy-- but The Return of the Clerkenwell Kid is ultimately an exercise in déjà vu: the feeling you've been to this electro-lounge before. Return revisits a baker's dozen of tracks from the Weld's 2001 debut, Where Psyche Meets Cupid, albeit with fresh recordings and a smattering of, ahem, real new material. Also recurring is Coates' self-described ""antique beat"" style, which in itself mingles the long-ago with the recent: Twenties and '30s music-hall and Tin Pan Alley (via ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", Village Green-preserving Kinks, or tourmate/fan Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields) with copious sampling and light, pastoral electronics of the Saint Etienne school. Scratchy victrola-like sound effects and sly clarinet-playing enliven resurrected tracks like banjo-picker ""Am I in Love?"" as well as the newbies, including instrumental opener ""Waking Up"" and melodramatic ballad ""Little White Birds"". Pun-picking ""Daisies"" adds a bossa nova rhythm. More than just another case of history repeating, Return really makes you think twice. With whirring electronic beats and ever-slinkier clarinet, ""L'amour et La Morte"" strips Coates' love-and-death theme what the French call ass-naked. ""Got a heart like an exit wound,"" Coates breathily half-sings behind his usual telephone-like filter (a more confident presentation would better suit the ambitious arrangements). The songs trace an apparently romantic relationship from the sprightly, unsuspecting acoustic guitar of ""Anything But Love"" to the wry ""Goodbye Stephen"", in which Coates envisions his own demise (""Will my family and friends all turn out to wave/ Dressed in their best fine nice things to say?""). Between, ""I Love the Rain"" offers porn wah-wah, distant piano lines, didgeridoo-like noises and the admonition to ""let's get wet"". Newbie ""Something Beautiful"" goes alpha beta gaga with multi-part vocal harmonies. Unfortunately, Return misfires more often than its predecessors, omitting the debut's great ""Terminally Ambivalent Over You"" and never living up to I, Lucifer's inspired scat-dance single ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"". Overly precious ""Lavender Hill"", in particular, suffers by comparison (uh, is that acoustic guitar intro from ""Free Falling""?). When his conceits pay off, though, Coates appends a few charming, eclectic revisions to music history and his own. On a song called ""Déjà Vu"", his whisper takes on Waitsian darkness: ""This touch on your skin reminds you of/ What was it again?"" The feeling you've been to this electro-lounge before...","Latest record from the sometimes-solo project of Britfop Stephen Coates.

Hail Social,Hail Social,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1835e6ef95969323709/1:1/w_160/446f0296.jpg,2005-09-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4022-hail-social/,Polyvinyl,"""Radio, radio,"" Dayve Hawk sings on ""Come Out Tonight"". Most of his lyrical efforts on Hail Social's debut are as vibrantly decorative as gold glitter, and just about as empty (no dis-- the Rakes half foot-shot their debut with poignant lyrics, and Hail Social comes off better being pretty vacant). But if you're into the pat unity that symbolism provides, you can read it like that: An oblique invocation of alienated distress and wayward transmissions to put a sinister twist on the invitation to ""Come out tonight/ There will be someone waiting."" Really though, those six syllables are just a handy pivot between the crunchy guitars of the chorus and the blocky bass of the next verse. The unthinking man's Franz Ferdinand won't make you reexamine your heteronormative assumptions, but you might feel like going out. Then again, maybe there's more to it-- after breezing through the nine remarkably easy-to-listen-to tracks on this album, it's not hard to imagine that ""radio, radio"" is Hawk staking out his territory. Some of you will hate Hail Social on principle, catching a whiff of crass commoditization, and maybe you'll even lose respect for Interpol for ""putting them on."" After all, this Philly band just burst out of nowhere and snagged a Spin ""Band of the Nanosecond"" clip for their press file, armed with LCD Soundsystem bass pulsation, staccato new-new-wave guitars, Rick Oca-slick type production and Duran Duran arena stomp, an emo falsetto in a post-punk mask. All of these snap together to create the spiky, measured turbulence of opener ""Hands are Tied"". You know those gum-machine toys, where you have to get a bunch of oddly-shaped pieces to fit together in a perfect sphere? Like that. ""I met her, and I walked away/ A mess of emotion,"" Hawk belts. Tough guy/ Sensitive guy total package, anyone? Yep, it's gonna be that kind of party. Another camp will dislike it on first blush, but find themselves helplessly won over in the long run (stop by my tent and say hello, we can rock out to Hail Social, Stellastarr*, and Longwave in likeminded company). And diehard popists will wish Hail Social had gone even further in distilling every fuck-all trendy modern trope into one shining pop gloss. But everyone should agree that this debut is the model of efficiency: One singer, one guitar, bass, drums, and even these are deployed sparely. The bass favors rigid polygons, gliding on ""Repetition"", sparring with handclaps on ""Get in the Car"". The guitar metes out crisp, syncopated leads that waste no notes in outlining the melodies, and Hawk's voice soars effortlessly over the open spaces. RIYL singing along, amping up your toilette before a night out, fun.","SpinArt presents the unthinking man's Franz Ferdinand. Not a bad thing.

Loose in the Air,The Double,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb75ea9e61561daa7245/1:1/w_160/6b999c2f.jpg,2005-09-13 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2553-loose-in-the-air/,Matador,"When last we heard from Brooklyn quartet the Double with their 2004 Catsup Plate release Palm Fronds, drummer Jeff McLeod was on the disabled list with a hand injury. This setback forced the group to hastily re-shuffle their recording strategy, as they were required to utilize a jerry-rigged assortment of electronics and loops to drive the album's blearily muted melodic clatter. And though McLeod is back at full-strength for the Double's Matador debut Loose in the Air, the group's experience with on-the-fly problem solving continues to hold them in good stead, as they here constantly labor to reconcile the conflicting personality traits inherent in their nettlesome music. Produced by Steve Revitte, who's recently worked with Black Dice and the Liars, Loose in the Air features several episodes of such pure stray dissonance that one might prematurely conclude the Double are ready to emerge as a full-fledged noise act. But these frequent, consciously misshapen crescendos often stand in opposition to the group's more conditioned 1960s rock movements and wiry dub figures, and in direct contention with David Greenhill's shivery, metropolitan vocals and the occasional undisguised Ray Manzarek flourish from keyboardist Jacob Morris. At peak altitude the album's relentless, destabilized push-pull can create exquisite levels of unresolved tension, but all too often, when their many disparate elements fail to crystallize, the Double can begin to merely resemble a lesser Interpol equipped with a vintage Vox Continental organ and misfiring rayguns. One trait Loose in the Air noticeably shares with Turn On the Bright Lights is a distinct shortage of laughs, or even courteous smiles, as the men of the Double here knit their brows resolutely towards the skylines. Seemingly every track carries vague messages of some imminent, unnamed trouble, as Greenhill's desperate lyrics struggle to make themselves intelligible above the music's potent static. On the lurching, powerful ""On Our Way"", such lines as ""The radio turns itself up...the continent's turned on its side"" intermittently bubble through like transmissions from a bad satellite feed, while on the following ""Hot Air"", Morris' sinister carnival organ takes over to sweat out an urgent post-punk ""Five To One"" pulse. Throughout the album, the Double are at their best on patiently-built tracks like the throbbing, wormwood dub of ""Up All Night"" or the seven-minute epic ""Dance"", both of which rise by increments to reach impressive, shrieking heights of amp feedback and distorted electronics. Less compelling, however, are those songs they attempt to drive headlong into more conventional popcraft, such as the perfunctory indie bounce ""Icy"" or the freeze-dried grunge of ""What Sound It Makes the Thunder"", an overcooked stomp that simply begs for the type of unhinged performance that the Double seem unwilling (or unable) to give it. These periodic lapses of over-constraint are especially disappointing given the group's obvious talent for making spontaneous mid-air adjustments to their sound; but there's enough evidence here to be optimistic that one day soon the group will gain the swagger necessary to more consistently abandon themselves to their wilder sonic impulses.","Brooklyn quartet makes their Matador bow with a Steve Revitte-produced record that blends dissonance, 1960s rock, and wiry dub.

In the Reins EP,CalexicoIron & Wine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9879d034d5c69bf5243/1:1/w_160/45a86f48.gif,2005-09-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4129-in-the-reins-ep/,Overcoat,"Why didn’t somebody think of this sooner? It’s not a fair question, but it’s an easy one to ask once you’ve heard the seven-track In the Reins, the first in what, if we’re all very lucky, will be a series of collaborations between Iron & Wine and Calexico. Iron & Wine’s Beam and Calexico’s Joey Burns sound heavenly harmonizing with each other, especially when guest vocalist Natalie Wyants joins them. Neither is an exceptional vocalist on his own, both occasionally lapsing to a whisper, but those hushed, gently melodic cords singing in unison make magic. Beam is the principle songwriter and vocalist on the album, and he’s written some A material for the record, admirably putting his all into it instead of offering up some throwaway stuff and hoping Calexico can do something with it. What ultimately ends up happening is Calexico’s sense of cinematic grandeur and eclecticism imbues Beam’s melodies and lyrics with an expansiveness that his humid Floridian folk doesn’t usually have. Shades of jazz and country creep in, and they even tackle straightahead California pop on “History of Lovers”. The only ingredients from Calexico’s usual recipe that are absent are dub and mariachi, but they employ their arsenal so sympathetically to Beam’s vision that an unschooled listener might never guess that this wasn’t a proper, working band. Calexico are no strangers to backing other singers—Burns and drummer John Convertino began playing together as Howe Gelb’s rhythm section in Giant Sand, and they’ve contributed to dozens of LPs by other artists over the years. The core duo of Calexico brings along most of the collective of Southwestern musicians that enlivens their own albums—Paul Niehaus’s lap steel, in particular, helps to shape the sound of the album. “Prison on Route 41” and “16, Maybe Less” both traffic in hushed country’n’western tones, but are arranged in such a way that vocals give way to instrumental passages so smoothly that the solos don’t feel at all like showcases. There isn’t a disappointing song on the EP (mini-album might actually be a better word for it), but it’s worth noting a couple of stand-outs. Opener “He Lays in the Reins” is a subtle waltz stuffed with flourishes of acoustic guitar and brushed drums that almost two minutes in introduces the operatic Spanish vocals of Salvador Duran, a complete leftfield move that proves as inspired on subsequent listens as it does jarring on the first listen. But the real highlight is also the biggest shock: “History of Lovers” is what Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours might have sounded like if it had been recorded in Memphis, complete with steel guitar trim and a great horn arrangement to go with some stunning harmonies and an unbelievable vocal melody. Whether or not Iron & Wine and Calexico ever choose to follow this up with another collaboration (fingers crossed), it’s clear that both acts are stronger for having worked with the other. It’ll be interesting to see what comes next for Iron & Wine and Calexico and how this affects their work apart from each other. In the meantime, we can hope that this isn’t a one-time-only engagement.","Sam Beam teams with the Southwest’s Calexico on a seven-track mini-album that ranks with anything either act has done on its own.

August Born,August Born,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1caea9e61561daa48a9/1:1/w_160/99a8d64b.jpg,2005-09-12 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/484-august-born/,Drag City,"Last year Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny contributed liner notes for VHF's reissue of the early-90s Japanese psych-folk rarity L's Holy Letters, in which he paid homage to the music and its creator, Hiroyuki Usui. And one didn't have to listen long to the crackled textures of Holy Letters' deeply evocative outsider folk-blues to detect Usui's influence on Chasny's subsequent work. Since then, the two musicians have cultivated an extensive correspondence which has now culminated in the formation of August Born. Collaborating by way of tapes exchanged in the mail, August Born's debut album finds the duo attempting to overcome the barriers of language and distance to quarry their substantial expanses of musical and spiritual common ground. In addition to his multi-instrumental work as L, Usui has made wide-ranging experimental music with underground luminaries Keiji Haino in Fushitsusha and various members of Ghost in Marble Sheep. Here, however, August Born maintain a respectful simplicity in their partnership. Most of these tracks are constructed from spare, interwoven splinters of banjo, amp feedback, muffled percussion, and various found sounds in accompaniment to Chasny's distinctive finger-picked guitars, while both musicians take turns trading blurred vocals. Usui's music is heavily steeped in rural American blues-- as evidenced by his spectral version of Blind Willie Johnson's ""Cold Was the Ground"" on Holy Letters-- and his playing here results in several performances that are as traditional as anything Chasny has previously put his hand to. And though the limitations of its recording process can make the album seem like a fragmentary sketchbook, it also contains in its depths glowing coals that could only have been sparked by the collision of such similarly high-charged, inspiriting talents. As is often the case with mail-based collaborations-- Christina Carter & Loren Connor's Meditations on the Ascension of Blind Joe Death, for instance-- listening to August Born's loose dialogue feels like eavesdropping on an intercepted cell phone conversation. Voices speak over one another, phrases are inadvertently interrupted, and promising leads not followed up. ""Birds & Sun & Clay"" sounds like a pleasant but uneventful outtake from Six Organs's School of the Flower, while on ""Song of the Dead"" the two musicians lightly paw around ideas, each perhaps too deferentially waiting for the other to make something happen. But then there are the moments that, with little advance warning, the duo manage to achieve offhanded heights of an enthralling symbiosis. ""More Dead Bird Blues"" grows out of Usui's incantatory vocal to become a weightless volley of skeletal guitar, gauzy voices and shimmering percussion, a hypnotic exchange that carries over to the following ""Last Breath of the Bird"", as if the two were reflecting beams of sunlight to one another via handheld mirrors. And as the album closes with the electric hum of ""A Lot Like You"" and the intimate guitar of ""You Will Be Warm"", it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish one musician from the other, their individual voices gradually converging into the same ungrounded tongue, and leaving one with the hope that this proves to be merely the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial association.","Drag City-issued collaboration between Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny and Japanese psych-folk artist Hiroyuki Usui.

The Curious City,Modey Lemon,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3665e6ef9596932381a/1:1/w_160/f0a8a4b6.jpg,2005-09-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5662-the-curious-city/,Birdman,"Modey Lemon have been a perfectly capable band with obvious influences, attacking proto-punk and garage rock with aplomb, ability, and a glint of self-awareness. For fans who've been following them closely, hearing the occasional electronic detour in their meat-and-potatoes rock stew, The Curious City is the sound of your band all grown up. Compared to previous album Thunder + Lightning there's more melody, more ambitious structures, more psychedelic detours, and more surprises here. ""Bucket of Butterflies"" sets the tone, moving from a sludgy, lumbering opening riff into a lighter, melodic shuffle through strummed sparkling pop into a three-note Disney villain gallop onto a snarling chorus and adroitly back to square one to start again. The streamlined ""Sleepwalkers"" is little less flashy, but still weaves electronic and psychedelic influences into a sleek whole, and the ghostly organs on the bouncy ""In Another Land"" provide some of the album's most psych-rock moments. They can also pull back and quiet down, as on the melodramatic mid-tempo ""In the Cemetery"", and the record's lyrics are sung with clarity and restraint. The fluidity dulls some of the immediate punch of the songs might have otherwise-- the brief chorus to ""Bucket of Butterflies"" would make a fine song itself if the band wanted to keep things static-- but seamlessness is it's most impressive quality, especially following the apparently simple Thunder + Lightning. That old band appears every once in a while, popping up for a moment in ""Bucket of Butterflies"" or the reckless riffage and wailing of ""Mr. Mercedes"" like a hand gripping the inside brim of a boiling cauldron, but never for more than a moment. The relentless shifting works best when not spending too long on any one idea, and when leaning on the monumental drumming of Paul Quattrone. ""Bucket of Butterflies"" is ably carried through hairpin turns in tempo and rhythm, and scurrying keyboard riffs like the one to ""Red Lights"" are pummeled senseless. Without Quattrone, the band couldn't get away with all this. They don't get away with everything, though; The organ drenched ""Fingers, Drains"" gets bogged down in execution, and while the acoustic plucking of ""Countries"" is a pleasant change in sound, it's not nearly as captivating. Plus, the groove to the closing ""Trapped Rabbits"" is deadly, but not enough to sustain its 16-minute runtime. But that's another surprise: These 10 tracks feel epic with all their twists and turns, but rarely exceed the five-minute mark, and lose none of the urgency of the band's earlier work.","Indie band attacks proto-punk and garage rock with aplomb, ability, and a glint of self-awareness.

Apollo Sunshine,Apollo Sunshine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17113d197565213862d/1:1/w_160/59cbe786.jpg,2005-09-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/404-apollo-sunshine/,spinARTHeavy Rotation,"I've been hearing a lot about how downloading (legal and otherwise) is going to hasten the death of the album. I don't buy it. I think what's really happening is that the two media, short and long formats, have reached something of an equilibrium point where certain music is best presented in an album context, while singles are better for others. Which is entirely logical. Even in spite of their prodigious pop songwriting chops, Apollo Sunshine fall more into the album camp, as their approach to melodious rock 'n' roll is gleefully chaotic, full of too many influences to properly enumerate them and inclined to stretch the conventions of media like so much sweet taffy. When I say they swing on a dime from charging rock to hushed balladry to back porch jams to plaintive country, I mean it. These songs don't seem to mind completely reinventing themselves halfway through, interrupting what you thought was a quiet, emotional song about feeling displaced in the world with a dive-bombing instrumental passage that flits between new wave and bottom-heavy groove. This is what happens on opener ""Flip!"", where the narrator implores the stars for advice and they tell him to ""keep breathing."" Apollo Sunshine's worldview, as their name suggests, is generally bright and hopefult, though it's tinged with enough uncertainty to provide tension. All four members sing (they've gained one member since their debut, 2003's wildly inventive Katonah), often harmonizing when you'd least expect it, such as singing stacked ""woo-oohs"" in the midst of a raging guitar squall on ""Phyllis"". Song titles make an interesting word-association string: ""Magnolia"", ""Phyllis"", ""God"", ""Lord"", and ""Bed"". The music sounds free-associative, too, and there's little consideration given to restraint. They're inspired to yell on the wailing Southern rock stomper ""Lord"", and so they do, with wild abandon, Sam Cohen and Jesse Galalgher shredding vocal chords over the muscular rhythms of new recruit Sean Aylward and drummer Jeremy Black. When I lived in the band's home base of Boston, Black and Cohen played together in a band called Ca$h. Ca$h were a good band, with some excellent songs (""Smash Your Radio"" even got some ironic airplay), but it was identifiably pop-punk; it had a genre. Even then, there were hints of the complex song structure they're into now with Apollo Sunshine, but this new band has no real genre outside of made-up, adjective-loaded hybrids like ""manic, free-associative pop"" or something like that. There are great stand-alone songs here, like the 1960s-at-78-rpm sugar rush of ""Eyes"", but Apollo Sunshine is best listened to in a full dose and appreciated in all its messy glory.","Latest record from SpinArt's gleefully chaotic guitar pop band.

Kyberneticka Babicka EP,Stereolab,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a569c0084474cd0c06f5/1:1/w_160/b7ed749c.gif,2005-09-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7504-kyberneticka-babicka-ep/,Beggars BanquetToo Pure,"Let's go to Stereolab school. You'll need: Stereolab are as reliable an institution as anything you'll encounter in formal education. After umpteen albums, EPs, singles, and compilations, that they maintain the fan base they do says a lot for the number of sturdy, aesthetically sound ideas they've produced. In the academic world, the band would be akin to a tenured professor, long past her prime and not producing much groundbreaking research, but beloved by her students (and not just because her classes are easy As). Nevertheless, one has to carefully weigh the options when considering investing in new Stereolab music: Yes, the quality is good, but what is its shelf life? Since school and new records are expensive, perhaps we should survey the coursework for their recent trio of 7-inch singles (also made available online as a digital EP) to see if they make the grade. The two-parted ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" is like a lost backing track from the Beach Boys' ill-fated Landlocked sessions, fitting somewhere between ""'Til I Die"" and obscure bed-period Brian Wilson things like ""Loop de Loop"" or ""When Girls Get Together"". Vocals harmonies are layered seven people thick, spilling into my lap like milk halfway to ice cream. Stereolab are still masters of gorgeous repetition, maddening though it may be to listen to eight or so minutes of the same two chord sequences. In fact, unusual for the band, these vocals may actually be looped, which lends the tracks (separated in name only, this two-parter sounds like a one-parter sliced to fit within 7-inches of vinyl) an almost inhuman character-- and that's a realm in which Stereolab often resides. However, I can respect this track: The ""melody"" is almost non-existent save some overtones poking out of the vocal harmonies, but like all the best minimalism, the end result is deceptively engaging, lulling me into hypnosis one minute, up to my ears in dairy-laden ecstasy the next. Course credit: A- ""Plastic Mile"" and ""I Was a Sunny Rainphase"" are much more conventional, which in Groop terms equates to more variations on the Chicago post-rock period sound of the band's post-Emperor Tomato Ketchup catalog. The former tune is a mildly kaleidoscopic (though even-keeled to a fault) song that doesn't quite live up to its sleeve's day-glo cover art. Laetitia Sadier sings a high-pitched, occasionally hushed melody, surrounded by a pleasant array of vocal counterpoint lines, trumpets, Farfisa, and a chill vibe the Free Design would have killed for. And yes, that could describe any number of Stereolab's songs, but I doubt you'll be complaining I mislead you when you hear it. ""I Was a Sunny Rainphase"" is more upbeat, sounding like one of the rockier tracks on ETK (or hey, Margarine Eclipse). There's a break in the middle where everything slows down, trumpets swell, clavinets, er, clav, and what should be an introduction to the bridge gets stretched over and right back into the verse. Removing the expected details of pop music is one of the band's strongest points, but in comparison to ""Kyberneticka Babicka"", it feels like a belabored one. Course credit: B- The final installment of the singles features two more up-tempo songs, ""Interlock"" and ""Visionary Roadmaps"". The first begins like an old-school Motown jam, with a drum-fill straight into Northern Soul stomp. No, Sadier never ends up belting a vocal like Major Lance, but for a few minutes anyway, she maintains the opening momentum with catchy, syncopated refrains like, ""What good is all this knowledge we've acquired in the face of deep Nihilism?"" ""Visionary Roadmaps"" borrows the beat from its A-side, using a slightly altered melody and an even slightly-er different chord progression. And Brent bless them, they sing ""ba ba ba"" at the end. Of course, you've heard this all before-- from Stereolab and me-- and while it's never unpleasant, it's not exactly memorable. Course credit: C And just like the die-hards stayed with Brian Wilson throughout the 70s, no amount of unsurprising Stereolab music will sway fans much. In fact, I'm going to play ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" a few more times, and watch the others dissolve into the stew of their discography. As these things go, a B-average isn't bad.","This trio of Stereolab 7-inch singles-- packaged together as a digital EP-- revels in the familiar, easygoing combo of light pop, psychedelia, and krautrock.

Cripple Crow,Devendra Banhart,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20f5e6ef95969320320/1:1/w_160/3210dd00.gif,2005-09-12 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/553-cripple-crow/,XL,"As ""freak-folk"" began to hit a stride last summer, Devendra Banhart's Golden Apples of the Sun compilation suggested a cogent introduction to the genre. A year later, Cripple Crow provides, in a sense, the loose-knit scene's strongest group effort to date. Banhart's fourth album isn't a compilation, nor is it billed as a group project, but he's assembled such a rich cast of cohorts here, it feels more like the fruit of community interaction than the product of a lone singer/songwriter. The communal vibe is hinted at by the album's artwork: Rather than adorning the cover with his usual calligraphic scribbles, Banhart offers a composite photo of ""The Family"" (a term he often ascribes to his musical friends), gathered beneath a large knotty tree and accompanied by the disembodied heads of smiling spirits. Sgt. Pepper is the obvious point of departure, though unlike the Beatles' classic, there are no numbered silhouettes in the liner notes to decode the relative anonymity of the photo subjects. Fittingly, the only immediately recognizable figure is Banhart himself, crouching front and center, wings spread wide. The artwork conjures Native America, an attribute Banhart seemingly alluded to in a recent email exchange, admitting that he's ""a little terrified at how white most of the people are,"" but reassuring me that ""68% of the people on the cover have Native American blood."" Indeed, Banhart strives for ethnic diversity on Cripple Crow, boasting the highest concentration of Spanish-sung tracks of any of his albums (he was raised in Venezuela where Spanish was his mother tongue), and finding him moving further beyond ""freak"" territory and into a worldly blend of various exotic approaches. Banhart has always experimented with method and sound, but he's never before approached Cripple Crow's expertise and variety. In all its obvious details, the album not only finds Banhart coming into his own as a songwriter and performer, but suggests future directions for the 24-year-old as well. Having started out on primitive recorders and four-track machines, Banhart only recently graduated to proper studios, and Cripple Crow further increases fidelity, possessing a warmer, more pristine quality. His vocals, too, often draped in slight reverb, are especially assured and less flaky than on previous outings. And as mentioned above, an ensemble cast showed up to back him: There's best chum Andy Cabic (aka Vetiver), Noah Georgeson (of Joanna Newsom's old rock band the Pleased, and producer of The Milk-Eyed Mender), and Thom Monohan (Pernice Brother and production whiz). The cast also includes members of Currituck Co., Espers, Yume Bitsu, The Blow, Feathers, CocoRosie, and others. Basically, it's a traveling band of hippies excited about Donovan who aren't afraid to rock. On Oh Me Oh My's ""Roots"", Banhart sang, ""I don't play rock 'n' roll."" All that's changed. Cripple Crow features an explosion of psychedelic R&R stuffs. ""Long Haired Child"" maneuvers a three-pronged guitar attack-- Adam Forkner's distorted noodling, Banhart's wah-wah, and acoustic coupling-- backed with Otto Hauser's drums and Jona Bechtolt's percussion. ""Lazy Butterfly"" is memorable for Cabic's closely mic'd backing vocals and a tambora sheen along with hand drums and guitars. And ""Little Boys"", which Banhart alleges is sung from the perspective of a schizophrenic Hermaphrodite, is divided in half by a mid-song bass change-up which shifts the song up from a sorta boring Oldham prom-dance lament to its sinister, surfy refrain: ""I see so many little boys I wanna marry/ I see plenty little kids I've yet to had."" Juxtaposed against a number of upbeat rock tracks, Banhart's quieter, more introspective material often makes a stronger impact. ""Dragonflies"", a whispered duet between Banhart and Matteah Baim of Metallic Falcons, flutters by in less than a minute with a cryptically tender lyricism. Likewise, album opener ""Now That I Know"" is one of his most beautiful and controlled tracks yet. It finds him backed only by cello and his own guitar, in confessional: ""12 years old/ In [my] mama's clothes/ Shut the blinds and lock up every door/ And if you hear someone's coming near/ Just close your eyes it'll make 'em disappear."" Elsewhere, on ""Heard Somebody Say"", there's a sense of protest, with Feathers' lovely vocals adding witch-hunt background layers. Banhart gently lays down the thesis-- ""Heard somebody say the war ended today/ But everybody knows it's going still""-- before winding around to the chill-inducing punchline, the easiest anti-war slogan ever: ""It's simple, we don't want to kill."" Later, he tries out Dylan rhyme schemes on ""I Feel Just Like a Child"", while ""Some People Ride the Wave"" is Louis Armstrong with New Orleans toy jazz (""some people write the songs that stay inside our souls""); ""The Beatles"" lets it be known that ""Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only Beatles in the world"" before shifting gears into Spanish; Pangea and various fertility myths are given new legs in ""Chinese Children""; and endless love song ""Korean Dogwood"" tells as thorough an elliptical story as Banhart's tackled. Banhart's ambition is apparent throughout, but at 22 tracks and almost 75 minutes, the album does stretch its legs too long. Though it feels like an attempt to document as thoroughly as possible his late winter retreat to Woodstock, any more experienced mystics will tell you that blanks, dissolves, gaps, and other ingredients for mystery could've made it even richer. Still, Cripple Crow is undoubtedly impressive, vastly singular but entirely accessible, and an inspired listening experience where Banhart again proves himself one of the more talented and charismatic forces in modern music. ","Devendra Banhart's fourth album corrals the combined talents of the loose-knit freak-folk community; the result is one of the scene's most accessible and engaging records.

Takk,Sigur Rós,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fe13d1975652138be9/1:1/w_160/a34b47c5.gif,2005-09-11 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7155-takk/,Geffen,"When Sigur Rós' second full-length record, Agetis Byrjun, landed stateside in 2001, its extraterrestrial oozing was so unfamiliar (and, subsequently, unnerving) to American ears that it managed to finagle a staggering number of meticulously rendered comparisons to glaciers and fjords and icebergs: By year-end, it seemed oddly plausible to presume that Sigur Rós' songs were actually being mouthed by giant mounds of snow. Something about Agetis Byrjun-- its celestial groping, its shimmers, its weird vastness-- seemed handcuffed to the landscape from which it was born. Thus, the mythology of Iceland-- of staggering literacy and longevity, of Björk, of Reykjavik, of volcanoes and fisheries and giant slabs of ice-- became the mythology of Sigur Rós. Unsurprisingly, domestic intrigue peaked almost immediately: The record's liner notes and cover-- a silver alien-baby hybrid boasting angel wings-- revealed precious little about its creation, and vocalist Jonsi Birgisson openly admitted to howling in an entirely self-fabricated language. In 2001, Sigur Rós were deliciously strange, the only sensible soundtrack to post-millennial comedowns, all future and faith, bones and blood and ice and sun, culled gently from an island far, far away. In the years that followed, Sigur Rós released three EPs, reissued their debut, and popped out another full-length, the ever-contentious, unspeakable ( ). With each new record, the band dutifully maintained their trademark swells, bowing consistently before the altar of ebb and flow, until Sigur Rós began to sound less like an icecap melting and more like Sigur Rós. The mystery melted, the fascination faltered, and the animated, barstool retellings of The Sigur Rós Story died down. Still, Sigur Rós are more than just a conversation piece, meatier than their reputation, better than the otherworldly blubbers they're so casually accused of: With Takk, the songcraft that once made Agetis Byrjun everyone's favorite sunrise record re-emerges intact. Melodies stick, songs coalesce, and Sigur Rós lay off the grim theatrics, reminding listeners everywhere that they intend to play theaters, not funeral homes. Ultimately, Takk is a warmer, more orchestral take on the band's defining sound, and easily their most instantly accessible record to date (shockingly, over a third of the album's songs clock in at under five minutes each.) The cheerless drones of ( ) are replaced by more bass, drums, piano, horns, and samples, strings are more prominent than ever before, and Birgisson's lyrics are especially incidental, all barely-audible squeals and sighs. Mostly, Takk is ecstatic, constantly erupting in funny little waves of joy. Dissenters who rejected Sigur Rós as the soundtrack to wrist-slittings everywhere might be temporarily perplexed by the band's new, wide-eyed giggles-- but mostly, Takk just sounds like Sunday morning Sigur Rós, all yawns and sleepy grins and quick yanks at the curtains. ""Glosoli"" is the record's shining center, a rapturous, tinkling swirl, with Birgisson's high, squeaky howls (sounding perfectly thin and kitten-y) shooting through a thick, stomping mess of chimes and echoing guitar. The song builds slowly, finally bursting in a deafening explosion of heavily-distorted guitar slams (think, oddly, of Coldplay-- particularly the end of A Rush of Blood to the Head's ""Politik""). ""Glosoli"" manages to be both ethereal and concrete at the same time, which is Sigur Rós most effective trick: ""Glosoli"" tempers its fRóst with curls of hot human breath, a tongue on an icicle, frozen and warm all at once. ""Gong"" is all antsy drums and careering guitar, while the steamy ""Saeglopur"" tiptoes from piano and tinny glockenspiel to a breathtaking vocal harmony, and, finally, an ominous swell of full-band noise, just deep enough to inspire some vicious head-nods, if not full-hip dancing. Elsewhere, the band falters. ""Se Lest"" and ""Milano"", the record's longest cuts, are both vaguely hollow-- ""Se Lest"" is too preoccupied with its own atmospherics, while ""Milano"" meanders without meaning. Takk proves that Sigur Rós can, in fact, transcend their own legend: The tendency to descend into new age goo is still present, and Takk, like all of Sigur Rós' discography, is not for the viscerally-minded. Regardless, the record is more than just meaningless wisps. Crank it in the late summer heat and see if it melts.","When Sigur R\xF3s' second full-length record, Agetis Byrjun, landed stateside in 2001, its extraterrestrial oozing was so unfamiliar (and ...

Wargames,Rob Swift,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60d13d19756521390c6/1:1/w_160/1d82cf13.gif,2005-09-11 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7670-wargames/,Coup D'etat,"Considering the context around its release, Wargames should be monumental. President Bush's approval rating had been wallowing below the 50-yard line for weeks even before the tragic delays in bringing aid to Katrina victims. Cindy Sheehan, in spite of all her ideological inaccuracies about the war, opened a national dialogue on its necessity. Even Republicans are starting to think twice as they head into mid-term elections without solid reasons for our Middle East adventure. So considering the current climate, one would think that Rob Swift's venture into the political sphere four years after 9/11 would be a welcome addition from one of the world's best DJs. Instead, we get a lot of noise-- a muddled album of dissent with absolutely no teeth. The war's been a catalyst for a lot of useful and informative protest art, but pure anger and disgust is no substitute for astute and insightful political commentary. Case in point, the fictional Bush laughter on the ""Intro"" is totally ridiculous. Recreating Bush as Vincent Price at the end of ""Thriller"" does nothing to further discussion about our war policy. The excerpt from a news transcript of the Amadou Diallo's murder in New York on ""41 Bullets"" is certainly important, but has nothing to do with the Wargames theme. Playing a clip of Bush speaking about 9/11 on ""The President Is Speaking"" seems to lend credibility to W. (""This is an enemy who preys on innocent and unsuspecting people, then runs for cover,"" the Prez says, but who argues with that?) ""Piano for Condeleezza"" is a just a piano riff for 1:11 and nothing more. That's it. If there's a stunning indictment in there, it's invisible. In fact, Swift gets away with 41 minutes of not saying anything at all. Wargames only succeeds with hints at what could have been. On cuts like ""A Terror Wrist"", Swift makes like the Herbaliser and creates some real schizophrenia with shrill violins and creeping voice-overs. ""Military Scratch"" posts a similarly frightening urgency. Now if Swift used ominous tones like this to paint America with dystopian hues in a post-terrorist future, that'd be a statement. But as it stands Wargames sounds like a lot of anti-war banter: a lot of complaints and ad hominems with no solutions, alternatives, or nuance.","Anti-war concept album from the big-name DJ.

Heavy Trash,Heavy Trash,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1825e6ef95969323707/1:1/w_160/f77651e4.jpg,2005-09-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4021-heavy-trash/,Yep Roc,"A bandname could be expected to describe the music at hand, but as such Heavy Trash is misleading. The Jon Spencer side project has created a mirage of an album, a ghostly echo so light it's barely there. Talk about music that burrows in your brain: Spencer and fellow dumpster diver Matt Verta-Ray (Speedball Baby) ride a candy Cadillac on hypnosis spinners, pumping haunted psychobilly all the way to the asylum. It ain't always fun. Cheeky, carnivalesque, brain-curdling-- who besides the completely delusional would actually enjoy this stuff? Probably the same people who fantasize breaking down at an abandoned gas station somewhere in the Nevada deep desert. Spencer's voice trembles over badlands vistas, stirring up all manners of strange sediment. Consider ""Dark Hair'd Rider"", one of the album's most stable cuts: Two curt guitar solos ride atop smoggy bashed toy cymbal, making you cough and wheeze. Spencer's vox are still sick and dirty. If nothing else, give him credit for knowing how turn a perfectly nice blues-rock dance party into revulsive sex-drug splooge. Pared down from Blues Explosion's chunky chug, Heavy Trash build a sound primarily with drums and rollicking Epiphone. (Tube amp? Reverb? Check, check.) The most effective songs are the emptiest. ""The Loveless"" gets by on Spencer's oily curled-lip vocal, sounding not unfrightening against a hollowed-out two beat. He's ""a mean son of a bitch,"" ya know. ""Gatorade"" is similarly discomforting. Feeling low, Spencer says to his baby, ""Fix me up fast with some, um, good first aid/ Hit me with a blast of that Gatorade."" The narrative continues over tip-toeing plucked guitar, cycling back to the vociferous-by-comparison chorus: ""Gatorade! Gatorade!/ Tastes so good, I'm amazed."" Creepiest part is the final, whispered ""Gatorade..."" at song's end. Could be the aging bluesman is subliminally, metaphorically, insidiously promoting drug use-- or just seeing who he can get to shit pants. Straighter joints like ""The Hump"", which channels ancient Stones, sound good, but miss out on the intense visceral weirdness of the strictly guitar/drums howlers. So we kind of get two albums, and a dilemma. Daftness offset by songs like boot-stomper ""Lover Street"" and drippy ballad ""Fix These Blues,"" the album confounds. But a more consistent, non-capitulatory Heavy Trash would be basically unbearable, a free ride to the bughouse-- no longer a band, but a sentence.","A light mirage of an album from this Jon Spencer side project.

Instrmntl,Dabrye,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbf5e6ef95969322cab/1:1/w_160/6cf526fc.gif,2005-09-11 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2623-instrmntl/,Eastern DevelopmentsEastern Developments,"Instrumental hip-hop is pretty much bullshit, isn't it? The idea is fine, I guess. (Though, you know, beats and rhymes.) But has any genre-- call it downtempo or trip-hop or whatever-- forced us to sit through more un-reconstituted dreck than rap-less rap? For every beat with a pretty texture over it, there are hundreds-- dozens on Ninja Tune and affiliates alone-- of canned breaks with keyb noodling or swiftly EQ'd samples. The '90s gave us worse plagues, but not by much. Still, the one good thing about wallpaper is that it's just there. And unless it's screaming at you in neon green, well, then ignorability is part of the deal. So the scrap heap of milquetoast beats is more of an environmental problem than an aesthetic one. (I'm gonna call James Lavelle right now to bitch about his part in global warming.) But here's a few reasons why Dabrye's newly back-in-print 2002 mini-LP Instrmntl shouldn't be tarred with my (broad) brush. 1. Length: Dude, it's 30 minutes. There are plenty of things that can be done in 30 minutes that don't require a Ring Cycle to fill. Like brushing your teeth and shaving and having your coffee and reading the newspaper and walking to work. I did it this morning and I found the whole process invigorating. Or maybe I just didn't notice much. But when I did, there were some good beats. Does an instrumental hip-hop album need to be 80 minutes? Does any album? 2. Warmth: Dabrye's first mini-LP, One/Three, had a bit of the tech-house chill to it, that ol' operating room funk. Like Zapp stranded in Antarctica until Roger Troutman's throat closed up and he needed mittens to operate his drum machines. Like Jam & Lewis if they left the door to that Twin Cities studio open. (Okay, I'm reaching now.) Which, admittedly, was part of what gave it an identity. Instrmntl is much more ""organic"" (no, wait, come back), with punchy standup bass, buzzing keyboards, flutes (yes, I know). How deep is that bass on ""Take Me Home""? And why is it only 1:45? (A: See #1.) 3. Beats: Sure, a lot of it is canned Jay Dee, but whatever--it still works. It's the lack of reverb, those hard thwacks right down the middle of the snare. Or snipped handclaps (the power of truncated samples). Or lovingly sculpted, fatty kicks. Or the almighty cowbell. He gives the beats an apple-crisp snap or toothy pull you just can't get through faded breaks. 4. Catchiness: The thing is just catchy. The main reason is that Dabrye fills these little Joseph Cornell beat-boxes with so much just-so detail. Most downtempo is happy to loop a loop for six minutes and slip out for a smoke. There are the little keyboard vamps that playfully tug at the bass on ""Intrdctn"". The flute that darts like a kingfisher in ""Won"", before the whole track (claps, cowbell, stinging synths) drops out. But sometimes, as on ""Evelyn"", it's spare and still catchy, just fudge-thick keybs flecked with little white chocolate chips of filigree. As with any formula, some people are just more talented than others. It's just a shame that Dabrye, like Mr. Urban Tribe, gets lost in the sluice of funk fakers.","Rare instrumental hip-hop triumph is back in print from Eastern Developments.

Help: A Day in the Life,Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85413d1975652139615/1:1/w_160/9a97b024.jpg,2005-09-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2097-help-a-day-in-the-life/,War Child Music,"When the first Help! compilation was issued in 1995, it was billed as the fastest-made album of all time, with 20 of the UK and Ireland's rock and dance stars entering the studio on a Monday and the LP in the shops the following Saturday. For the most part, the record-- organized by charity War Child to aid Bosnian children victimized by war in the Balkans-- was an artistic as well as a humanitarian triumph, offering the first airing of Radiohead's ""Lucky"", almost two years prior to OK Computer, and featuring excellent tracks from the Boo Radleys, Oasis, Orbital, Portishead, the KLF (as The One World Orchestra), and others. Ten years later, the War Child organization has repeated the effort, pulling together 22 indie-friendly UK artists to record tracks with the results, Help: A Day in the Life, for sale as downloads the following day. (A CD version of the project will be released on Independiente later this month.) In order to aim its quick turnaround, initial pressings of the 1995 charity disc offered no tracklisting or list of contributors, neither of which was missed-- most artists were easily identifiable: Indeed, of those who contributed to the original Help!, only Kerrrang! fave Terrorvision and third-tier Britpop band Salad are now mostly forgotten-- and the latter was propped up on the comp by dueting with the Specials' Terry Hall. Had listeners been forced to guess who's who on the current Help disc, it would have been much more difficult to distinguish between a largely faceless group of meat-and-potatoes guitar pop acts and new wave revivalists. Sadly, the most telling thing about the record is its condemnation of the UK's indie-minded gatekeepers in the years since Britpop. The first Help! took place just a few weeks after the Blur-Oasis chart battle, a moment when Britpop's creativity was crashing but its popularity and the belief that its success was tied to England's national identity was ebbing. It felt like a time when normally tangential artists could command the spotlight, and to their great credit they did so in order to boost War Child. It was also around this time when Britpop quickly devolved into retro-obssessed conservatism where ambition was equated with chart success rather than artistry, and the best way to reclaim the glories of mid-Sixties British guitar rock was to lazily build MOR bridges to the past. Ten years later the UK indie circuit is so unadventurous and tepid that we have the editor-in-chief of the NME scrunching his nose up at Antony and the Johnsons' Mercury Prize win, calling an album of gorgeous cabaret-pop ""too weird"" for his audience. So step forward Keane, the Zutons, the Coral, Damien Rice, Elbow, Hard-Fi, Razorlight, Kaiser Chiefs, etc., and take your seat at the current Help! table, where, unsurprisingly, none of them punch above their weight. The biggest draw on the disc is a new Radiohead track. That song, ""I Want None of This"", is no ""Lucky"" but it's one of the disc's highlights-- Thom on a piano in his maudlin, ""You and Whose Army?"" mold, mixing funeral dirge with finger-waggling. Many others chose slower tempos as well, such as the usually nervy neo-wave bands Maxïmo Park, Hard-Fi, and Bloc Party, and the all-action Go! Team, with only the last two delivering quality tracks. Belle & Sebastian continue to toss curveballs: Their ""The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House"", with its elastic bass and off-kilter percussion, could have fit nicely on the Books EP. Pete Doherty's Babyshambles, the Magic Numbers, Sudanese-born hip-hop artist Emmanual Jal, and Coldplay all run in place. Antony is here, dueting with Boy George, on a mundane reading of ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"". Covers of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (Keane with Faultline) and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" (the Kasier Chiefs) were more puzzling choices. Both are breakup songs-- one about a young gay man leaving his sugar daddy; the other sees the jilted learning his fate through heresay and rumor-- and neither work. Keane's effort is largely innocuous, while the Chiefs' grasp at replicating a mix of ""Ghost Town""-style dub and dread and the Slits' own frenetic ""Grapevine"" cover falls flat. So here's the pride of UK indie, and the best tracks are from a cartoon band and a group from Mali. Damon Albarn-- one of three holdovers from the first set (along with Radiohead and the Manic Street Preachers)-- does a 180 from ""Eine Kleine Lift Musik"", the woozy music-hall ballad he and Blur offered 10 years ago. Here he slips into pan-global mode with the rather haunting, almost reflective ""Hong Kong"", which sounds more like his longtime band's Think Tank than a Gorillaz track. Tuareg band Tinariwen, an influence on Albarn, and their Tishoumaren rebel music nicely fits the theme of the record-- the band formed in a refugee camp in the 1980s-- and the drony track projects a blend of weariness and spaciousness, solitary anguish and a need for community. What's missing this time around? Non-guitar music, for the most part. Ten years ago, Massive Attack, Orbital, Chemical Brothers (as remixers), Portishead, Andrew Weatherall and James Hardway, the Stereo MCs, Neneh Cherry, and the KLF all appeared, most of them offering positive contributions. This record's lone electronic artist, Mylo, does little to support the need for more of the same-- and the shoehorning of Dizzee Rascal into the dismal Band-Aid 20 release shows the peril of tokenism-- but it's still disappointing and indicative of the current UK indie mentality that rhythm is largely absent from this global charity record. It's also a fundamental failure of the organizers, who've drawn a narrow pool of artists at the detriment of the record's ultimate goal-- raising as much money as possible for War Child. It's not difficult to imagine that a wider variety of artists or the inclusion of pop, r&b;, grime, and dance music would translate to a larger number of potential buyers. Unfortunately, the worthwhile project also risks becoming relatively lost amidst the outpouring of aid and money for Hurricane Katrina relief. On the face of it, the work of War Child-- providing assistance to children affected by war and conflict-- and hurricane relief are drastically different; one an ongoing, manmade problem and the other a natural disaster. In another sense, War Child does exactly what was not done for thousands of Katrina victims-- provide aid for those who can't help themselves. It's a deeply unfashionable idea in today's ""ownership society"" America, but just as Katrina horrifically demonstrated the failings of such policies, spotlighting the America that the architects of an ownership society seek to sweep under the rug, to abandon, to demonize even as they're being preyed upon within their own communities by those who use violence as an organizing tool and power grab, War Child seeks to do the same around the world.","Second Help!

Heartaches & Highways: The Very Best of Emmylou Harris,Emmylou Harris,by: Stephen M.

The 20 tracks on her new retrospective Heartaches & Highways all adhere to a similar metronomic setting, somewhere between a country ballad and a church hymn-- steady, patient, and reserved, not really slow but certainly not fast. ""I don't have that many up-tempo songs,"" she confesses to Robert K. Oermann in the liner notes. In a sense this plays to her strengths and allows her to draw out every note so that her ragged, dignified voice can wring as much pain from the syllables as possible. Kicking off Heartaches & Highways, ""Love Hurts"", her duet with Gram Parsons, bursts with exquisite heartbreak, so tended and curated that it sounds museum-worthy. Following that song is ""Boulder to Birmingham"", which Harris wrote for Parsons following his death in 1973. Those two songs are about as perfectly sad and weepy as you could ever hope for, and the circumstances of their recording give them an extra punch, although ""Boulder to Birmingham"" seems to be missing something essential, and after a few listens you realize it's Parsons' voice. The 18 songs that follow never quite reach these musical heights or emotional depths, but do we really expect them to? In the ensuing 30 years, Harris has gone out and come back into fashion, her jet-black hair has turned alluringly silver, and she has recorded more than 20 mostly solid albums and countless collaborations, most of which are chronicled on Heartaches & Highways. Her voice blends mesmerically with Roy Orbison's gentle warble on ""That Lovin' You Feelin' Again"", and Harris re-creates 1960s girl-group harmonies with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt on their gentle cover of Phil Spector's ""To Know Him Is to Love Him"". Her collaboration with producer Daniel Lanois on 1995's Wrecking Ball-- represented here by the Gillian Welch cover ""Orphan Girl""-- reinvigorated her career with its darker, less traditional sounds, but it also set the tone for every album since, which all seem to prize atmosphere as much as songs. Over three-and-a-half decades, Harris has exhibited an exceptional taste in covers. Those included on Heartaches & Highways are deep-catalog picks from established artists, avoiding obvious choices or previous hits. Harris recorded Townes Van Zandt's ""Pancho & Lefty"" before it was a hit for Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson and gives their more popular version a serious run for its money. In addition to providing impeccable material, these covers often allow her to step outside of her midtempo comfort zone: she retains the skipping rhythms of the Louvin Brothers' ""If I Could Only Win Your Love"" and even quickens her pace for Delbert McClinton's ""Two More Bottles of Wine"". Harris's gift for inspired covers culminates with the collection's only new track, a version of Randy Sharp's ""The Connection"" that teams Harris with original producer Brian Ahern and early collaborator Fayssoux Starling. It's yet another midtempo song, a downbeat number that might sound better on an album that wasn't entirely comprised of downbeat numbers. And that's the crucial flaw in Heartaches & Highways: It implies that Harris's talents were limited to a certain breed of song, and while these twenty tracks all prove dynamic showcases for her singular voice, they barely hint at her considerable range of abilities and interests.","New 20-track retrospective of ballads, hymns, and duets features appearances by Gram Parsons and Roy Orbison.

CRU,Seu Jorge,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb52ea9e61561daa71f4/1:1/w_160/27a7d12d.jpg,2005-09-08 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4361-cru/,Wrasse,"I found Rio native Seu Jorge's music like many of you did-- in a Wes Anderson movie. Like most folks watching The Life Aquatic, I was captivated and puzzled by his graceful, acoustic, Portuguese-language renditions of David Bowie covers such as ""Starman"" and ""Five Years"". Jorge also appeared in City of God, although that didn't have much to do with music unless there is some arcane connection between his role as Knockout and Diplo's Baile funk culture-mongering. Jorge himself was raised in the favelas so desperately portrayed in Fernando Meirelles' film, but there isn't any booty bass in his bossa nova. On CRU, Jorge's voice and pristine guitar work make the tangentials of his success postscript. This is not to say his second solo album is perfect. In fact, it has holes near the end and at times lacks a backbone. But his samba is precise and frisky, especially on ""Bem Querer"" where his a- once harsh and flitting voice dances. The spare, booming percussion doesn't just suggest hip-hop-- it is hip-hop. Jorge has his voice-- at once buttery, soulful, and fierce-- mixed up front on every track, like a rapper. Album closer ""Eu sou Favela"" (translation: ""I Am the Favela"") is akin to Young Jeezy's recent declaration ""I am the Trap"". Territorial-identification and submersion is a distinctly prideful act, one not lost on someone who has witnessed murder. This is not to say he spits bars. But he's doing something like it throughout. Jorge's cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Chatterton"" is music nerd fodder, but the song-- wrapped in a deep, ominous synth and rapid strumming-- is no French layabout. On it he gnarls his voice into a wretched growl and transmogrifies Gainsbourg's historical name-check into a funky séance, fit with shrilling witch moans at its languid conclusion. A press release compares Jorge's style to Nick Drake; that assessment isn't far off either. The accompaniment on many of the songs here is ethereal. Muted maracas shake, didgeridoos blow, and bird calls squawk. Only one song here is sung in English, a quietly rapturous cover of Elvis Presley's ""Don't"". It's a gorgeous reclamation project and prime girlfriend-mixtape material. Unless she understands Portuguese, in which case, the album's best song, the mellifluous opener ""Tive Razão"", should open anything with 2005 on the spine. As a Favela-saluting everyman, Jorge mostly avoids America-seducing, though. That's why not being able to understand the words on CRU is both maddening and rewarding.

And it's true that everything about their debut, Capture/Release, screams NOW, from the nervous post-Wire guitars familiar from Franz Ferdinand and Kaiser Chiefs, to the tattoos-under-starched-shirts lyrical purview, to the Paul Epworth production. Unfortunately, Capture/Release might be the victim of bad timing: It's going to sound pretty rote to American audiences who've been steeped in this stuff for the past couple years, and while it's doubtful that the Rakes are overtly ripping off any of the bands they resemble, it scans as a failure of imagination on the listener's end. Art Brut's mundane, declarative statements are funny as hell, balanced perfectly on the sincerity/irony axis, and Skinner's are richly detailed. The Rakes aren't as witty as Art Brut, and they lack Skinner's close scrutiny, but their lyrical slant-- revolving around the working trendy person's guilt and ennui-- is not without interest. ""Retreat"" sets the tone for the album by swinging wildly between earnestness and apathy. ""Everything is temporary these days,"" Alan Donohoe laments. But in a record that's all about jaded acquiesce, he immediately gives up: ""Might as well go out for the third night in a row."" After wondering whether he should donate his money to a charity or go on holiday, Donohoe succumbs to malaise: ""Walk home, come down, retreat to sleep/ Wake up, go out again, repeat."" The working man's blues even creep into the paranoid ""Terror!"": ""And my job in the city won't matter no more/ When the network is down and my flesh is all torn."" While a portrait of a generation's concerns, however superficial, does emerge, the triteness of these concerns and the clichés Donohoe often uses to limn them fall short of endearing. ""I had just woke up in someone else's bed/ She was overweight/ Who did I do last night?"" he charmingly wonders on ""The Guilt"". But if you find the lyrics resonant (maybe it helps to be a young working Brit with a ""22 Grand Job"") and you aren't sick of jittery eight-notes yet, Capture/Release is a well-mounted entry. ""Strasbourg"" introduces a searing two-tone lead, a fluid rhythmic drive, and Donohoe's winning sneer in perfect pop succession, while ""Retreat"" fulfills the off-kilter Talking Heads impulse with chomping guitars and muted harmonics. ""Open Book"" is a staccato shuffle with verse-busting ""oh-ohs"" and a suavely sexy vocal line; ""Binary Love"" gleams with squiggly guitars and hooky, romantic verses; the slight reverb and sparse, hollow percussion of ""Violet"" fit in the mandatory ""sorta reggae"" slot just fine. But by the time ""Work Work Work (Pub, Club, Sleep)"" rolls around, the message-- crass materialism breed existential angst-- starts to weigh down the medium, and one longs for a lighter touch.","Debut from another well-recieved, nervy UK post-Wire guitar pop band.

Vocalcity,Luomo,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda65e6ef959693230cf/1:1/w_160/d1053b17.jpeg,2005-09-08 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/,Force TracksForce Tracks,"New Year's Day, 2003. At a semi-luxury hotel a few kilometers from the coast, a sprawling complex of balconied buildings and a swimming pool nestled next to a stand of trees, a few hundred ravers in summer duds-- some in dirty Diesels, some in bikinis, and all eyes hidden behind enormous, smoke-colored shades-- pivot and sway while the last molecules of MDMA sweat their way out of their systems. On a stage facing the pool, a skinny young man with a blond mane swigs champagne from the bottle while he nudges absently at a computer mouse; his own massive eyeshield tosses off disco glints that mirror the flashes of light that go tearing up the firelines between bass and space in his music. It's every Balearic cliché at once, except that this isn't Ibiza, it's Reñaca, Chile; and the laptop jockey isn't Sasha van Oakenweed but a skinny Finn named Luomo, née Sasu Ripatti, best known until not long before as Vladislav Delay-- a former free-jazz drummer who made the leap to Chain Reaction-styled ""heroin house"" before being crowned prince of clicks + cuts. The event is notable for several reasons, among them the globalization of European leisure culture; but the real significance here concerns the ongoing conversion of tight-lipped minimalism into something self-consciously sexy and sophisticated and Ecstasy-friendly. It's the preface to an ongoing evolution that is only coming to fruition in 2005, when the Sasha van Oakenweeds of the world pepper their mixes with tracks from Kompakt and Traum, and Creamfields' beachside raves feature the likes of Ellen Allien and Blackstrobe alongside Deep Dish and Carl Cox. In many ways, all this began with Luomo's 2000 debut, Vocalcity, reissued this month on Ripatti's own Huume label. Vocalcity was unexpected, and not a little audacious: ""Luomo-- The Next Episode in House-- prod. by Vladislav Delay,"" proclaimed a sticker on the sleeve. The album was published by Force Tracks, one of an avalanche of sublabels from Frankfurt's Force Inc., an erstwhile ""proper"" techno imprint that had gone all theoretical as it aged, christening sublabels after Deleuze and Guattari tomes and fashioning grand philosophies around concepts like ""clicks + cuts."" (Full disclosure: I wrote the liner notes for Clicks + Cuts 2.) ""The Next Episode in House"" sounded like the kind of sweeping, appropriationist, Zeitgeist-stroking statement that Force would make-- but damned if it weren't true. If anything, it sounds even truer today. It's not that Luomo advanced the cause of house music in some way that his forebears (Chez Damier, Derrick May, and Maurizio, to pick three) didn't manage to. But there was nothing else that sounded like Vocalcity at the time, and there's been precious little that sounds like it since, including Luomo's slightly disappointing, ill-fated 2003 followup The Present Lover. Writing in The Wire back in 2001, I pegged Vocalcity as the tipping point (the clipping point?) in what I called microhouse-- a genre that seemed to take the essential template of house music and shrink its constituent parts (that shoomping beat, a cavernous sense of space, and an echo of soul music as processed through disco) down to byte-sized pieces, leaving a schematic of dotted lines swimming through oceans of dubwise absence. But listening now, it's clear that I got it exactly backwards, at least in Luomo's case. What stands out now, a half-decade later, isn't the smallness of Vocalcity's sounds but its fullness. Sure, Luomo has the requisite clicks and clanks; as ""Market"", the absolutely epic lead track, opens up, half the action is in the chattering of truncated hi-hats and a distant rattle that sounds like an army of mechanics spinning their ratchets. But house music has always had these kind of details; for comparison, just listen to E-Dancer (Kevin Saunderson)'s 1997 cut ""World of Deep"", the track I've come to believe most closely heralds what Luomo would later attempt. Beneath those enormous, cascading pads, the hi-hats and bells have been whittled down to needlepoint proportions. Luomo emphasized his details by framing them in white space, but what you hear now, after the demise of clicks + cuts, aren't the pinpricks but the enormous, inflated sounds of everything else-- bass, pads, and of course those vocals. True to its name, Vocalcity put breathy, yearning male and female vocals at the center of its pneumatic mix. Tracks like ""Market"", ""Class"", ""Synkro"", and ""Tessio""-- a full two-thirds of the six-track, triple LP-- expand like inner tubes as those voices come rushing in. Indeed, my favorite element of the album has always been the way that ""Market"" begins by teasing in the vocalist's breaths and sighs, one tiny gasp at a time, along with fragments of sung melody buried deep, deep, deep in the mix. Only at 4:48, nearly halfway through the 12-minute track, does she finally introduce the full vocal hook. And when the sad reprimand drops-- ""There's nothing in the world that you can do,"" repeated a full five times, then a quick breath, and finally the explosive charge buried in the slug, ""For me""-- Well, we could talk about formalism all day, but people, that right there is one of the most perfect moments in the world of pop music, albeit a full minute and 18 seconds after most pop songs have punched out the clock and gone home to sleep. That's the triumph of Vocalcity. Not reduction, but expansion. Vladislav Delay has always aimed for the long view. (If you think Luomo's tracks are long-- ""She-Center"", at 10 minutes, is the shortest thing on Vocalcity, and the rest average around 12 minutes apiece-- check out Vladislav Delay's 2000 album Entain, where the cuts run from 15 to 22 minutes long. 2001's Anima went even further, comprising a single, hourlong track that swirls in place like a dead tide.) If there's anything ""micro"" in Vocalcity, it's the way tiny little holes open up within the frizzing chords, as though you could see the pixels framing each fraying waveform. But that's all academic. Five years later, ""minimal"" techno has fattened itself up again. Most of today's rave hits don't sound anything like Luomo, but I don't think anything today would sound the way it does if Luomo hadn't seduced the tinkerers away from their mouse pads and back to the land of goosebumps and sex. What you hear most in Luomo today are the stomach-punching bass lines, the pistoning chords inherited straight from Chicago's finest, and those maddeningly ambiguous vocals, always hovering just out of reach. Perhaps the long exception is the male refrain in ""Synkro"", which could stand as the tautological epigraph to the album's simple brilliance: ""Because you move/ The way you move.""","Five years after it helped define microhouse and kick the clicks + cuts aesthetic to the curb, Luomo is reissuing his groundshifting house LP Vocalcity on his own Huume imprint.

Spät-Europa / In die Nacht / Litia,Asmus Tietchens,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86513d1975652139643/1:1/w_160/6f242e13.gif,2005-09-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11852-spat-europa-in-die-nacht-litia/,Sky,"German experimental electronic composer Asmus Tietchens isn't exactly the first person most people think of when they discuss synth pop. In fact, even among hardcore electronic music fans, he's more known for his longstanding dedication to academic electronic music in the spirit of Stockhausen and Pierre Henry, and in fact holds a position at the University of Hamburg. However, having also worked with Tangerine Dream's Peter Baumann, Conny Plank, Cluster, and Thomas Köner, he's had more than a trivial say in the development of electronic pop. His first record for the Sky Records (also home to LPs by Cluster & Eno and Neu!'s Michael Rother)-- 1981's Biotop-- sounded like the work of a composer obviously at home with discordant textures and off-kilter beats, yet had a patchwork, DIY charm belying his pedigree as a ""serious"" composer. Die Stadt is engaged in an ongoing series of Tietchens reissues, and the three records he made after Biotop are full of small pleasures and electro-vignettes, the likes of which should readily appeal to fans of old-school electronica and new school lo-fi experimentation. 1981's Spät-Europa (or Late Europe), like Biotop from earlier in the same year, sticks with short tunes as a matter of practice. Tietchens had planned to compose an album featuring nothing but two-minute songs, though without the benefit of a laptop or high-tech digital editing software, he settles for analog instrumentals ranging from 1:48 to just over two-and-a-half minutes. This kind of homemade efficiency is perfectly suited to his buoyant, if slightly out of focus instrumentals: ""Poanpo"" spirals upwards in waltz time, using mini-Moog electro-rays with a warped counterpoint; the title track, after a short, barely audible introduction of church bells and choral singing, pushes ahead at glacier pace, with its high-pitched, melancholy moan serving as a cold, lonely hymn. ""Ausverkauf"" picks up the pace, allowing some archaic drum machine to mimic Neu!'s Klaus Dinger while bizzaro-circus melodies fly by overheard. In fact, Spät-Europa would make a fine soundtrack to an S&M; fete taking place in the darkest corners of Berlin, replete with bruised mimes and aluminum-plated dancing boys. The cool pitter-patter of ""Passaukontrolle"" plays over credits to what is by turns a disturbing and almost precious scene. The following year's In die Nacht (or In the Night) lightens the length restriction, and seems a bit less claustrophic by comparison. ""Aus dem Tag"" (""From the Day"") sounds almost benevolent compared to the semi-twisted pieces on Spät-Europa, and long stretches of breezy synth lines coupled with faux-music box ambience lend the track a cartoonish charm. The lengthy title track is much darker, with cavernous echo and a minor-key bass ostinato lurching behind a minimal, elongated melody that gradually morphs into something more bouncy. The obviously synthesized tambourine adds to the modest industrial feel, though Tietchens version of synth pop is always a little on the queasy side of goth. CD bonus tracks like ""Würgstoffe"" and ""Niedermacher"" are less accommodating, seeming mystical and dark, and foreshadow the composer's headfirst dive into abstraction starting in the mid-1980s. 1983's Litia is an entirely different beast, at times closer to the quantized, Eno-fueled version of electronic music favored by contemporary synth pop think tanks like Kompakt, and elsewhere approaching the retro-futurism of Broadcast or Stereolab. ""Zeebrügge"" might even fit on a Pop Ambient compilation if you ignored the alien, pin-prickled sounds at the bridge, though the steady, down-tempo beat keeps things earthbound. (In fact, at the time, the Tietchens was worried his tunes were getting so robotic, he was compromising his own creativity.) Yet, on ""Abhuster Nebulizer"", he predicts the experimental techno of Cristian Vogel and Felix Kubin, using crisp hi-hat and the barest hint of melody to make something very sleek, if slightly demented. ""Vorsaison"" uses a beat kin to Wire's ""Three Girl Rhumba"", sprinkled with more of Tietchens' take on circus music, though not nearly so bizarre as on the previous records. If his earlier Sky LPs were seminal for IDM, Litia is a convenient antecedent for electro-house and poppier end of minimal techno. Although Litia is the most approachable of this trio of reissues, all of Tietchens' Sky material will be of interest to fans of vintage electronic pop. Immediately afterwards, beginning with 1984's Formen Letzter Hausmusik, originally issued on Steven Stapleton's (Nurse With Wound) United Dairies imprint-- and part of Die Stadt's series of reissues-- he abandoned synth pop for musique concrete and some pretty uncompromisingly experimental music. I consider these albums something of an oasis in Tietchens' canon of concise, no-frills electronic pop, and though he may not quite be a household name for most people, he was certainly dedicated to making the most of his foray into the field.","Three reissues from the academic German experimental electronic composer.

Leaders of the Free World,Elbow,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc28eb335119a49ecbca/1:1/w_160/4ae6ed04.jpg,2005-09-07 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2720-leaders-of-the-free-world/,V2,"Guy Garvey name-drops his mum on two of Leaders of the Free World's 11 tracks-- first time she makes an appearance is on the title track (""Your mum don't sleep!/ The friends you keep!/ I didn't raise a thief!""), and the second comes into play when ""The streets are full of Goths and Greeks"" and Garvey hasn't ""seen [his] mum for weeks."" Manchester-according-to-Elbow is the creepiest of locales-- take Asleep in the Back's ""Any Day Now"" and its broken record mantra: ""Any day now, how's about getting out of this place?""-- so yearnings to crawl back to mummy or hit the road or, well, both, are understandable. Trademark Elbow is the languorous, brooding sort typified in 2001's Asleep in the Back and 2004's Cast of Thousands, but the band's third LP, Leaders of the Free World, leaves dankly gorgeous torpor mostly behind. George W. Bush is at least partially to blame, if only for the title track, which references him near-explicitly: ""Passing the gun from father to feckless son/ We're climbing a landslide where only the good die young."" The song's primary gripe is fair enough: ""The leaders of the free world/ Are just little boys throwing stones/ And its easy to ignore 'til they're knocking on the door of your homes."" The idea that America's president is ""spoilt, nasty, selfish little shit for brains"" (says Garvey to the BBC) is nothing new, but Elbow's take is problematic: World affairs are easiest to tune out when said affairs don't directly concern themselves; by confessing so, Elbow inadvertently declare accusatory kinship to ""little boys throwing stones."" The rest of the album flounders apolitically, as well. It's dull, for one thing. Why, pray tell, did Elbow decide to start sounding less like Radiohead rip-offs and more like midlife-crisis Travis? Leaders still intimates ""Creep"" in places, but it also garners new Brit bloke alignments: Past comparisons to Coldplay were probably undeserved, but present ones make sense. These guys are flirting with the seductively pointy fingernails of adult contemporary's harmless-but-gooey clutches. Gone is the charming fog of Elbow-rock, replaced by cheery caveats against partying too hard (""Picky Bugger""). Brevity has never been their strong suit, but this is Elbow at their dullest shoe-cum-navel gazing. Complaints that tempos never changed on previous albums were valid circa Asleep in the Back, but irrelevant now: Speeding up hardly helps captivate. If the plan was to bait with catchier hooks, and exhume sentiment with slower, choir-backed ones, it flops ponderously. Fast song/slow song switch-offs seem contrived and go to show: Elbow do best when going with their (preferably gloomy) gut.","Elbow slides from engaging to naval-gazing on their third full-length.

Luke Haines Is Dead,Luke Haines,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1815e6ef95969323705/1:1/w_160/4832607d.jpg,2005-09-07 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4020-luke-haines-is-dead/,EMI,"The most interesting figures in any movement are often the ones who turn up on the fringes, and Britpop was no exception. In an era of tabloid spectacle and the often wanton pursuit of superstardom, the Auteurs were something unique: Their music had the melodic grace of the best Britpop, but was far less ostentatious, and their leader, Luke Haines, filled his songs with caustic sarcasm and brutality. In spite of a Mercury Prize nomination for their debut album, 1993's New Wave, the Auteurs always remained something of a cult act, their critical acclaim outpacing their sales. Haines sort of perversely embraced his outsider role, naming his Baader Meinhof side project for a 1980s European terrorist organization and elevating scorn for the record business literally to an art form with his Songwriting Genius of Luke Haines & the Auteurs album, in which he recast some of his most popular songs as almost unlistenably syrupy orchestral easy-listening tunes to fulfill a contractual obligation for a greatest hits compilation. Since the dissolution of the Auteurs, Haines has had greater success with his Black Box Recorder project, which includes John Moore and Sarah Nixey, but this new three-disc set doesn't go there, instead focusing on material developed with the Auteurs, Baader Meinhof, and under his own name. There is more than three hours of music here, and it goes almost without saying that anyone who's not already a devoted fan of the man has no business starting with this disc. There's a huge wealth of great tracks among these 63 cuts, as well as a lot of variety-- the material ranges from sweeping, heavily orchestrated pop to despondent ballads about class war to electro-tinged funk-pop and scorching rock-- but I'd recommend newcomers begin where Haines himself began, with New Wave. Devotees will find plenty of value here in the unreleased cuts, B-sides, and BBC sessions, though it's unfortunate that amongst the few (pretty lame) remixes that pop up that nothing from the Auteurs vs. Mu-ziq is included. Mu-ziq made no secret of his disdain for the material he was remixing, and it made for some interesting work (Haines takes a humorous shot at it and Mu-ziq himself in the liners, in which he also rates most of his own albums five stars out of five). Most album cuts are presented in some sort of alternate form, be it an alternate mix or a slightly different single version, though no one who would actually buy this is going to be completely taken by surprise. Working it down to two discs by excising the tracks fans already know by heart might have been advisable, but I'm sure Haines had his own internally logical reasons for going with a three-disc set. Judging by the nine BBC session recordings here, I'd say it might be worth releasing an entire album of just those, as almost every one trumps the original studio version-- particularly the live recording of Now I'm a Cowboy's ""New French Girlfriend"". The sessions brush up comfortably alongside nearly a whole album's worth of previously unreleased songs (a few marked ""unreleased"" are just slightly different versions of old album tracks, for instance a sped-up, less T. Rex-ish ""Bailed Out""). A few are throwaways, like ""Couple Dancing""-- little more than a couple minutes of a string section warming up-- but others such as the funky clavinet crawl of ""ESP Kids"" and the throbbing disco of ""Essex Boot Boys"" definitely deserved a public airing. If anything held back Haines' vision during the 90s, it was probably his own very limited singing voice, which very often constricts to a gravelly whisper. Having Sarah Nixey around to handle the vocals is probably the principle reason Black Box Recorder managed a bigger foothold in the popular consciousness. Indeed, over three full hours of listening to his voice can get a little old, but I don't get the impression that this is meant to be listened to in one go like that anyway. If anything, it's a gift for all the people who stuck with him even through the most frustratingly obtuse phases of his career, and even during passages where it feels like something of a mish-mash, it's a rewarding look at an undeniably great songwriter.","This 3xCD set compiles album tracks, radio sessions, B-sides, and other gems from the acerbic singer-songwriter's non-BBR recordings.

Place me in an immersion tank and surround my ass with some doom metal. Who wants to float in simulated space conditions when they can choose to hide from the sun and get suffocated by their own sense of abandonment? YOB aren't an escape. They're metaphysical doom. Sure, you should be scared of evil. It can tailor-make your destruction in a heartbeat. But struggling with your faith, mind, and reason for being placed on this Earth are slower and much more frightening. Which isn't to say they're waiting around for your muscles to atrophy between snare hits (Khanate) or the bass drone to give your bowels a break (Boris). You could do the reference game with them all day, name checking Sleep, Burning Witch, Neurosis, and High on Fire-- even Electric Wizard, Ufomammut, Isis, Melvins, and Black Sabbath wouldn't be out of line. But YOB's The Unreal Never Lived-- four songs-in-50 minutes-- still stands out on its own as epic downtrodden metal with what sounds like seasoned potsmokers throwing in their High Times for some new age religious tracts. Four songs of peristaltic chug would be nothing without at least a few vocals. Vocalist Mike Scheidt has the diversity to growl, bellow, whisper, yell, and hit some high notes like few other metal singers. Be warned, the high notes can get a little nutless in the Dio or Geddy Lee vain, but they probably only last for around a combined 30 seconds. And that's the only goofy thing about YOB...Oh wait, I just read the lyrics. ""Quantum Mystic"" with its ""His message to this world still resounds for all time/ The Unreal Never Lived and the real does not ever die beyond all birth and death/ The real is timeless/ Open the shutter of the mind and it will be flooded with light"" is probably about the Indian Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj who answered most of the questions of life with vague ""I am"" answers. ""Kosmos"" even tells me, ""Peace lives in the space where no one is there."" But remember my teachings, my music reviewing students, ""Metal is what it is, when it is what it always was."" Even with some goofy lyrics, YOB sound like doom, the kind that has you up at night wondering why we even bother holding jobs when we barely get paid enough to pay for our housing and vehicles or why we bother befriending people if they are just gonna turn on us. And those methodical bastards in YOB probably enjoy causing that pain.","Four-song, 50-minute album of peristaltic chug and doom-and-gloom metal.

Broken Ear Record,Black Dice,by: Dominique Leone,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2daea9e61561daa4b48/1:1/w_160/be22c46e.jpg,2005-09-07 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/752-broken-ear-record/,AstralwerksDFA,"This is music for hiking across an alkaloid wasteland, equipped with enough oxygen and dried food to last through several days trek through a nitrogen-saturated atmosphere. There is a metallic taste to the air, and the sun, even at high noon, obscured by layers of sooty gas and overstuffed rain clouds. Black Dice, even when trying to inject a little rhythmic propulsion into their mechanic-industrial commotion, come off brittle and oil-stained futuristic. To a degree, this is dirty music, though more in style than execution; competing pulses from synthesizers, drum machines and the odd, antiquated guitar (via loop or sample, of course) destroy what little firm ground on which there is to step, but the landscape described by the sound is sturdy, if in need of polish. In fact, it's hard to say whether or not the quasi-urbanized clang is actually futuristic, as when drums appear, they're decidedly ""tribal"". Nevertheless, it's an isolated wilderness put forth on Broken Ear Record: away from city noise, refinement and fellow travelers. Brooklyn trio Black Dice are the most interesting ""noise"" band I know. Never content to inhabit one sonic guise for long, their track record for navigating unexplored areas of static, delay, distortion and bizarre, heavenly bits of electronic data is almost unparalleled among would-be contemporaries. They've landed on the spikiest stylistic beachheads in modernist rock, from splatter noise-core, electronic ambience, quasi-electro acoustic improv (EAI), death disco and now to what I would clumsily characterize as post-apocalyptic jungle-core-- and isn't that a mouthful? Consequently, as easy as it is to marvel at their ambition, it's sometimes tough to really settle into one of their records. There's always something a little uncomfortable about Black Dice-- but then they wouldn't be as interesting otherwise. Broken Ear Record, reportedly the result of the band needing more rhythmic material to play live, is no exception: It's flighty, frustrating, and at times a little frigid, but intelligent and never lacking in momentum. The sounds used should seem familiar to fans of 2004's polarizing Creature Comforts, as many of its synth patches, guitar tones and delay effects are featured on Broken Ear Record. The muffled, horn-like call that opens ""Snarly Yow"" could easily have been found hidden inside one of Comforts' robotic tone poems, as could the scraped percussion or the bizarre vocal loop that adorns its outer edges. However, here, rather than revel in the chaos of a savage urban jungle, Black Dice quantize the beats and sprinkle kick drums strategically throughout the track. There are moments that pound, but most of the time, the piece is content to merely suggest pulse, using loops and even modest stretches with straightforward melody. Make no mistake, melody doesn't play quite the importance in this world it does even in, say, Boredoms/Vooredoms' music (BD's most obvious predecessors)-- but as with Broken Ear's efficient use of 4/4 drum stomp, a little goes a long way. ""Motorcycle"" uses the elements of melody and industrial rhythm to best advantage, at times sounding like a clamorous update on the Indestructible Beat of Soweto. High pitched human barks bounce up from a chorus of thud-drums, and a buoyant guitar line I swear was lifted from Graceland carries the tune into regions previously too naked-faced ""accessible"" for Black Dice. Yes, there are machine gun hits at the end, and no, the relative upfrontness of the melodies never lulls me into thinking I'm listening to pop music, but I'm hooked nonetheless. Likewise, the single ""Smiling Off"" features vocal harmonies (!) and another thudding percussion cadence (more rollicking than primal this time), though withholding the payoff for several minutes while bass drone, static and an erratic siren battle for dominance, flailing blindly in a dark room. ""Street Dude"" allows this kind of battle to reign supreme, as stereophonic synth blare and a drowning chirp overwhelm the short-lived click-track beat. There are no truly ""calm"" songs on Broken Ear Record, but there are occasions to catch your breath. ""Heavy Manners"" uses a looped, queasy guitar figure with muffled vocals similarly to Animal Collective in one of their acid-damaged moments. Even ""ABA"", at less than a minute, allows me to shake away the haze via anti-gravity synth dips and pops. Still, Black Dice have hardly compromised what sounds like a pure vision. Their insistence on change is the mark of a still vibrantly creative band, and while I could do with even more rhythmic focus, I can't argue their total dedication to Broken Ear's aesthetic. Jagged and ornery, but playful: this is music for treading dangerously.","Brooklyn trio follows the polarizing Creature Comforts with a record that's flighty, frustrating, and at times a little frigid, but intelligent and never lacking in momentum.

Devendra Banhart/ Jana Hunter,Devendra BanhartJana Hunter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb91eb335119a49eca7b/1:1/w_160/f386ced7.jpg,2005-09-07 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11659-devendra-banhart-jana-hunter/,,"So constant has been Devendra Banhart's florid, wayfaring presence-- both within and without the still flourishing neo-folk scene-- that it seems difficult to believe that it's been less than three years since his Oh Me Oh My... debut. He's made the most of these 30-odd (sometimes extremely odd) intervening months: In addition to maintaining his near-continuous schedule of solo touring and recording, he's made cameo appearances with acts ranging from Vetiver to Antony and the Johnsons, and has unreluctantly emerged as the de facto ambassador for the freak-folk nation. In this latter role, he has been a valued and tireless champion of all things acoustic and enchanted. 2004's Banhart-curated Arthur magazine compilation Golden Apples of the Sun remains one of the scene's most defining documents, plus he deserves at least partial credit for helping to coax 60s folk legend Vashti Bunyan out of retirement, and later this year he'll help launch a new label, Gnomensong. Gnomensong's first release is to be Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom, the first full-length solo collection from Texas-based singer-songwriter Jana Hunter, formerly of Matty & Mossy, whose ""Farm, CA"" was one of Golden Apples's dusky highlights. And now Banhart has provided Hunter's career yet another boost with the release of this vinyl-only split LP. The album contains five songs from Devendra and five from Hunter, none of which, according to Troubleman Unlimited, are ever to be issued on CD. So while Banhart completists had best step lively, this weird little record sparkles with enough tiny moments of peculiar, glowing beauty that it should carry honest appeal for the rest of us as well. For his part, Banhart's contributions here should be considered as more of a sidebar to 2004's Nino Rojo than as a teaser for his forthcoming Cripple Crow. Of his five songs, three are alternate versions of Rojo tracks, and one is a live, intensely hippified full-band medley of Oh Me Oh My's ""Little Monkey"" and R. Kelly's ""Step In the Name of Love"", a match that unfortunately sounds nowhere near as strange as it looks on paper. Throughout these songs, Banhart displays a deft touch as both a singer and guitarist, treating the tracks as living, breathing entities as he fluidly bends notes and syllables in subtle new directions. And though the redundancy of many of these tracks may keep them from seeming truly essential, the lively, infectious joy of his performances ensures that none ever qualifies as a pure throwaway. Much more revelatory is Hunter's side of the coin. Despite what titles like ""That Dragon Is My Husband"" might lead you to believe, her approach lacks much of the old-timey naturalism of such contemporaries as Joanna Newsom or Marissa Nadler. Instead Hunter utilizes a distinctly homegrown, lo-fi production style filled with grainy overdubbed vocals, guitar and handclaps that gives her songs a deceptively rich depth of field. ""True love is writ with a stick in the pavement,"" she sings on ""Black Haven"", a song that, as with her others here, owes as much to K Records' handknit, DIY aesthetic as to any cross-generational folk traditions. With none of these tracks extending much beyond two minutes in length, Hunter's portion of this album provides just the briefest tantalizing glimpses of her talents, her songs brimming with the same sort of unique promise one might've detected on Banhart's own early demos just a few short years ago.","Just ahead of Cripple Crow, the freak-folk ambassador teams with his latest protégé on this vinyl-only split LP.

East Grand Blues EP,The Greenhornes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c02613d197565213b9da/1:1/w_160/183e7a3b.jpg,2005-09-06 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3684-east-grand-blues-ep/,V2,"The garage rock trend has peaked and is in obvious decline, but many bands remain ever devoted to their '60s influences: They were playing this kind of revivalist rock long before the minimovement became popular, and they're not going to stop now just because the radioplay prospects are shrinking. The Cincinnati-based Greenhornes have been working this particular corner of rock history since 1999, when they released their rough-and-tumble debut, Gun for You. Since then, amid several line-up changes that whittled the quintet down to a streamlined trio, the band has released three albums of blistering pop-rock that's better than most of the groups that stole their thunder, and they have shown their surprising range as Loretta Lynn's backing band (which she christened the Do Whaters) on her stately comeback album, , produced by friend-of-the-band Jack White. Even though the moment has passed them by, the Greenhornes are sticking to their guns and insisting their influences are timeless. Their new EP, East Grand Blues, expands their repertoire considerably, thanks to producer and White collaborator Brendan Benson, who polishes and sophisticates the Greenhornes' sound. Whereas their previous material was blisteringly raw and rowdy, these five songs prove much cleaner and more studied, hinting at a slightly different approach and a radically different direction. Parts of the EP sound invigorated by the change and exhibit the trio's range, but this new tack has its drawbacks. East Grand Blues begins with its most lackluster tracks: ""I'm Going Away"" sets dreamy harmonies to a Roger McGuinn guitar theme but seems lifeless, and ""Shelter of Your Arms"" perks up only for Craig Fox's insistent ""Don't walk away!"" on the chorus. The Greenhornes sound subdued and, worse, dull, especially compared to their previous material. Fortunately, on the EP's third track, the band shows more of its cards, recapturing and fine-tuning the heady momentum and rarified nostalgia the band is known for. ""At Night"" sets a tense Kinks-y verse against a darkly psychedelic chorus that's drenched in paisley organ swirls, and yet for all Benson's pristine production, the song sounds completely off the cuff-- simple, yet spontaneous. Building on that foundation, ""Pattern Skies"" rides Craig Fox's Creation-inspired guitar riff and Jack Lawrence's percolating basslines. Wood-block percussion keeps time on the closer, ""Shine Like the Sun,"" as Fox sings one of the band's best melodies, a short series of ascending phrases that's beguiling in its straightforwardness. These songs point to a further refinement of the band's sound on albums to come, but it's hard not to think that East Grand Blues would come across much better in a different context-- say, three or four years ago. Despite their best efforts, the EP sound twice dated: reminiscent of a decade long past and recalling a revival that's a few years gone.","Produced by Jack White, this is the latest EP from Cincy's garage rock early adopters.

A Tribute to Lisa Bonet,Felt,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bebfabf31b7dc71561c5/1:1/w_160/c453f20e.jpg,2005-09-06 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3349-a-tribute-to-lisa-bonet/,Rhymesayers,"When mainstream rappers do stuff like this, they call it mixtapes: Low-circulation albums, just for the heads, just relaxing, talking shit and perfecting their craft, no pressure to be great or important. For some reason, indie guys don't usually make mixtapes even though they should. When Slug from Atmosphere and Murs from Def Jux/Living Legends feel like ditching emo-rap for soft-focus dude-talk, they have to go and put out a whole album under a different name. And really, that's fine; I'm just glad they're doing this stuff at all. Both of these guys are famous for making grand, ambitious statements about their love lives or casual racism, Heavy Issues. They aren't so much famous for being able to rap really well, but that doesn't mean they can't. Most of Lisa Bonet is just on some ignorant rap shit, sex jams and effortless common-sense (not Common Sense) battle-rap on top of squelchy, greasy fake G-funk from Atmosphere producer Ant. Here's Slug: ""Thug white girl, suburban black hippie chick/ Punk rock straight-edge, hip-hop pothead/ Invite em all over for a mosh pit in my bed."" And here's Murs: ""She don't have to grow up with the same type of hard-heads/ Think she a Blood cuz her boyfriend's car red."" Or more to the point, here's Murs again, delivering the closest thing the album has to a mission statement: ""It's front-yard politics/ We talk a lot of shit/ Who we wanna fight, which broads we wanna hit."" And so it goes on; the two rip mics over rippling 70s cop-show-theme bongos on ""Early Mornin' Tony"" and beat the Young Gunz at their own game on the clicky, sidelong pimp jam ""Breaker Down Like a Shotgun"". And when they do get heavy, like on the thick, stormy confession ""Marvin Gaye"" (Slug: ""Open apology for anyone who follows me/ Didn't realize I was a self-made power-freak""), it doesn't last. A track later, they're talking fun Swingers bullshit over cheesed-out 80s synths on ""Life Vegas"". Other than a couple of throwaway skits where they talk condescendingly to girls on the phone, Felt 2 is pretty great. There's a sense of relief, like they've been doing this chest-beating thing for too long and they're relieved to figure out that they still have some knucklehead in them. And so when they inevitable Anticon moment does come on the last two songs, when Slug and Murs finally plunge back into the confessional, it feels well-earned, like they can go back to this stuff secure in the knowledge that they're still great rappers. And, you know, they're really good at this emo-rap stuff, too.","Slug from Atmosphere and Murs from Def Jux/Living Legends ditch emo-rap for soft-focus dude-talk.

Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike,Gogol Bordello,by: Jess Harvell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf55abf31b7dc71562c7/1:1/w_160/1d875733.jpg,2005-09-06 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3495-gypsy-punks-underdog-world-strike/,SideOneDummy,"Last summer, I dug a copy of Gogol Bordello Vs. Tamir Muskat by J.U.F. out of the promo box. (Or was it J.U.F. by Gogol Bordello Vs. Tamir Muskat? These pomo remixing shenanigans are hell on attribution.) I was vaguely familiar with Gogol Boredello-- a kind of fire-spitting punk cabaret troupe with traditional gypsy elements (or so I thought) outta NYC-- but this was something else entirely. There were beats, for starters-- dancehall, hip-hop, jigs and reels, thumping drum machines-- and samples (or was it all being played live?) of guitars, horns, and accordions. The vocals were declaimed in a style somewhere between uppity Balkan cabbie and ragga toaster, heavy on the nasal. The lyrics were about Spanish car service drivers and ""supernatural and infantile"" little spies. In other words, it sounded pretty much like my Sunday morning walk to get the paper when I lived in Queens. I later found out Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hutz DJs regularly in NYC, and his playlists sound like a dream: Dancehall, klezmer, rai, jungle, old Polish jazz-- all played at warp speed for a stupid-drunk audience of revelers to spit beer on each other and hump legs. The J.U.F. record was itself a mash-up of Gogol's live band punk gymboree and the ""play the best bits"" genrefuck of Hutz' DJ sets. So I was a little apprehensive about hearing the real Gogol for the first time. Given my personal biases-- DJ culture over live band, etc.-- how could it live up to such a perfectly formed little nubbin of modern eclecticism kulture? Especially when it was-- gasp!-- produced by Steve Albini! You can't mike a drum machine for maximum live-room sound. But, you know, it's great. The first thing I thought was ""the Ex"" and the second thing I thought was ""this is pretty fucking unique, really."" Like the Ex, they trade in ""world rhythms"" occasionally but don't make a big deal out of it. And there's a bit of the same guitar tone and scrabbling, scratching playing style (on violin as well) in there too. But whereas the vocals in the Ex can be passionate but kind of stilted, Hutz is pure sleaze, a long tongue down your mama's ear. ""Think Globally, Fuck Locally"", a song title and a catchphrase, one so obviously ripe for mass dissemination that Hutz wears it down his shirtsleeves. It also has a drum-break purportedly played on a overturned fire bucket, but I gotta admit it's a pretty well-miked fire bucket. There's also some bestially played guitar and sawed-off fiddlin', strangled cascades of notes that goes well with the loosely tethered drumming. Like a ton of the best rock, Gogol sounds like it's often on the verge of total chaos. Which is not to say they don't groove; the tension of near-collapse makes them swing even harder. ""Trouble Friends"" plays slashing guitar against a heavy one-drop reggae groove, a dubbed-out perversion of the one-drop roots sound that's all over dancehall this year. ""60 Revolutions (Per Minute)"" rescues the accordion from kitsch, mostly by speeding everything up to polka-punk tempo and throwing a little Latin rap in because they can. ""Immigrant Punk"" pairs another reggae groove against Morricone guitar and Hutz frothing about being eyeballed by small-minded townies just because he looks like he fell down at a Jo-Ann Fabrics store. In many ways, the fact that they ooze the same kind of stinky, trash-soaked, Greek-pizza-joint-coffee-tastin, Canal Street-on-a-high-summer-afternoon aroma through just a band in a room is even more amazing than the cut-and-paste J.U.F. record. (If not quite as thrilling.) Gogol don't play funk, but they sure are funky. And no one, not even Greg Norton, has a better mustache in rock than Hutz.","Steve Albini-produced record captures the same modern eclecticism culture and sound as the punk cabaret band's DJ work.

Accordion Solo!,10 in the Swear Jar,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8aab1335d7bf169932b/1:1/w_160/d4647ca2.jpg,2005-09-06 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8301-accordion-solo/,Asian Man,"Because this record sports wacky titles and Asian Man Records' Tao of Pepsi logo, you might assume that Ten in the Swear Jar (or XITSJ, if you please) is a bitchin' ska-punk combo. The found audio that opens the disc seems to confirm this suspicion, folding every offensive gay stereotype into one lisping soliloquy. This is unfortunate, since, unless Asian Man is wise enough to release the album with a sticker reading ""featuring Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart,"" a large portion of its target audience might miss out. XITSJ's existence (around the turn of the millennium) was brief, but they managed to record enough material for this 22-track précis. Accordion Solo! collects the bulk of XITSJ's debut LP, My Very Private Map, the follow-up EP Inside the Computer Are All of My Feelings, the unreleased Eat Death Orphans!, and a handful of live tracks. In short, this is a must-have for Xiu Xiu fans-- while it's naturally less developed, it contains plenty of winning experimentation and choleric melody; more importantly, it's a digest, albeit a slightly inchoate one, of the techniques Stewart is perfecting with Xiu Xiu: Here's a portrait of the mannered provocateur as questing manqué. Xiu Xiu's silvery guitars and murmur-to-caterwaul vocals are predicted on ""Hot Karl""; the regal synth line on ""San Jose Fight Song"" sound like late-Dismemberment Plan but foreshadows the digital sculptures of recent Xiu Xiu; and La Foret's clattery dirges can easily be traced back to XITSJ tracks like ""Gauntlet of Thor the Destroyer"" and ""When You Write"". But the biggest hook for collectors will be the early versions of Xiu Xiu tracks: ""I Love the Valley"", which became a fan favorite when it appeared on Fabulous Muscles as ""I Luv the Valley OH!"", appears in studio and live versions. This starker rendering keeps the guitar line and the lyrics, but finds Stewart's voice clambering between emphatic and tremulous passages, and replaces the vigorous lead melody with loopy, sliding synths. Happily, it includes the terse scream that pinions the middle, and drops in a jackbooted synth line that strikes with goosebumpy force. There's also an almost industrial version of A Promise's ""Sad Pony Guerilla Girl"" (here called ""Sad Girl"") and a wistful take on Fag Patrol's ""Helsabot"". Usually, this is where the disclaimer goes-- ""only recommended to diehard fans."" But Accordion Solo! is the rare early-career document that works as a stand-alone record. One gets the sense that Stewart had yet to develop the confidence to be as melodramatic as he'd like (he even sings in a quite unaffected, lovely voice on several tracks), and Xiu Xiu detractors might find this preferable to the more realized recent work, while for neophytes, it will provide a valuable foothold on Stewart's daunting, alien terrain.","Twenty-two track LP collects the studio work of and selected live recordings from Jamie Stewart's pre-Xiu Xiu project.

Serena Maneesh,Serena-Maneesh,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab5fea9e61561daa5d4f/1:1/w_160/3ea97c4a.jpg,2005-09-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8972-serena-maneesh/,Honeymilk,"Cocoa puffs, meh. The better story is rock's 50-year failure to make plain its furious soundmaker, the electric guitar. Sound is vibration, pure tone is farce, distortion is social, inevitable. No surprise, my faves who've struggled with that pop vs. noise, structure vs. unstructure windigo-- Branca, Hendrix, Velvets, Can, Sonic Youth, JAMC, MBV, Fennesz-- count for some of modern music's all-time greatest failures. Here's another one. Norway's Serena Maneesh take the main stage at Oslo's Øya Music Festival dressed like gypsies. Band leader Emil Nikolaisen has a wispy moustache, Chick Corea-style, Jimi-worshipping. His half-sister on bass could ring for Nico, a cold, daunting figure from afar, no stage movements, noble and grand, somewhat melancholic. The other members I can't see. ""What a fucking mission this band's on,"" I think. ""What a terrible fucking band."" They tinker on stage with a hint of motorik for 20 minutes, then a stomp of it, no sign of stopping; people have no stomach for this diskaholic bullshit, and tuck out for chicken and beer and, I think, Roots Manuva. No cue, no looks, Nico snaps a bassline from the stew of guitar noise and disembodied voices, and suddenly Serena Maneesh are bars into the festival's first and only mindfuck-- the one I went several thousand miles hoping I might experience. Tucked deep within ""Sapphire Eyes High"" is the only melody that matters this fall, its chorus unintelligible because Nico's voice dissipates upon exit-- so too do the stringy jangle and generously amped kick. The breathy line goes for but 30 seconds, entirely too short, then dissolves back into the abstractions that birthed it. So much noise it takes to balance out so beautiful a moment. They get it, Serena Maneesh, their demeanor electric and alternating, built off antagonistic relationships. The band, like the instrument, are apt to prove noise and un-noise are of one cut. To that end, these aren't 11 songs so much as 12 blood-riling arguments. ""Un-Deux"" jumps forth and back from sunshine pop to pork-pulled guitar noise, a clean but 30-mile-wide gap between the two, more impassible with each repetition. Two minutes, they give up. ""Don't Come Down Here"" takes a ho-hum strum and hopes that the one fissure in the progression-- a sloppy passing chord that butts with what's before and after it-- will, with enough repetitions, spiderweb and eat away the pleasantness. Nope. ""Chorale Lick"" and ""Candlelighted"" meander half their lengths, soft-focus guitars and brute syncopated grooves with nonsense floating in and about, shrouding melodies too shimmering for bare sight. The album as a whole fights the twelfth, track sequence playing up each song's coaster-like turmoil. A subtle move, but it bleaches the whites, deepens the blacks-- rare chiaroscuro for rock's faint of art. Listen, those fuzzy guitar octaves that start the record could have led us anywhere-- so for-fun, so worry-free-- but instead we follow them into themselves, until this full-length debut implodes with 10 minutes of dizzying, even skronky frustration, then a shriek off the footbridge. Why are the stakes so high? Better question is, why not?","Cocoa puffs, meh. The better story is rock's 50-year failure to make plain its furious soundmaker, the electric guitar ...

Thus far, Before the Dawn Heals Us has served as the defining exhalation of his emo Tangerine Dream climaxes-- it was his first solo dispatch sans co-conspirator Nicolas Fromageau, who lent a gentler, less urban touch to the modest, midday beauty of 2003's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Now M83's time line curves back to its skeletal 2001 self-titled album, newly reissued by Mute. If anything, M83 is a good spot to give pause to later Loveless comparisons. Cynics term Gonzalez's shoegaze one-dimensional, but he's focused on stars and hearts, not his laces. The disembodied guitars of his later period do evoke Kevin Shields; M83's dream pop, though, is more redolent of mid-period MBV, especially Isn't Anything's ""Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside)"" minus the vocals, and here this sweaty-palm sensibility is clearest. Rich in static, gauzy meteor showers and analog synth, the earthier palette may appeal to those who thought Before the Dawn too gigantic. Yet the sap's still here. In fact, when read in order and punctuated accordingly, M83's 14 track titles narrate the briefest boy-girl interaction: ""Last Saturday night at the party, Kelly, sitting facing that violet tree, staring at me. I'm getting closer. She stands up, caresses slowly my face. 'I'm happy,' she said."" Once this simple code's cracked, the music works as soundtrack to the buried tableau. Contributing to their cinematic frame, Gonzalez and Fromageau use a fair share of movie dialogue, and other speakers take turns imparting ghostly (or robotic) lines between drum machines and Sirkian swells. Parts of M83 fail to make an impression. A few snippety pieces are merely ear-candy transition, but fleshier works-- the swooning ""Night"" and upbeat ""Slowly""-- dote on dreamy glitch-pop. Odd as it may seem, ""Sitting""-- complete with dorky ""let's go"" sample-- is reminiscent of the Faint doing an instrumental AM radio version of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", and it's here I began missing the band's eventual focus on upfront live drums. Album closer ""I'm Happy, She Said"" points clearest to M83's future, opening on organ and glockenspiel before sputtering into Northern Lights percussion. Virtual hi-hat kicks one channel, a sputtering low-end jams the other. Enter minor chords, rising/falling cloudburst, extended pauses, minute emotional accretion. It sounds like how it feels to live inside a triumphal music box. Then there's a long pause, and a bonus bit. Then another. Ad infinitum. Needy contextualization aside, M83 provides a modest backward glance, a chance to see where certain seeds were planted, but pretty as it is at times, I keep wishing it would jolt from basic black-and-white to unwieldy technicolor.","Mute reissues the gauzy, earthy 2001 debut LP from the French neo-shoegazers.

Hard Times Are in Fashion,Koufax,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf8abf31b7dc7155bf6/1:1/w_160/de4e4ac7.jpg,2005-09-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4522-hard-times-are-in-fashion/,Doghouse,"Originally the project of Robert Suchan, Koufax now also boast the former Get-Up Kids' rhythm section, brothers Ryan and Robert Pope, as full-time members. The band claims to mix 70s rock with modern indie and pop, and cite ELO, Supertramp, and Steely Dan as their biggest influences. After hearing Hard Times are in Fashion, I'll grant them this: They have pianos. Opener ""Why Bother At All"" adds an extraneous barrel-boogie piano line to it's jerky new-wave rhythm. ""Back on Forth"" follows, a joyless mid-tempo track where Suchan chokes back lyrics like ""We can go back and forth on this one/ Always in denial/ About a president evidently cheating/ Through that awful smile"", sounding not only smug, but clumsy. So here's my suggestion: Listen to Hard Times Are in Fashion in reverse. If you want to hear the record Koufax claim to be making, you'll hear it most in closing track ""Colour Us Canadian"", and much more in the album's second half than in its opening songs. ""Canadian"" opens on a sassy piano strut with only a few squaks of single-note guitar, and somehow pulls off the sweeping faux-string keyboards in the chorus without sounding cliched. Suchan's words hint towards Americans lying about their background when traveling abroad to avoid criticism and just try to fit in (""We never bothered to learn anyone else's language...We heard their jokes, and we wanted in""). 70s pop-prog it isn't, but it has one foot firmly in the unhip past and shows personal, relatable insight in its lyrics. The galloping drums on the penultimate track, ""Her Laughter"", are far more kinetic than Hard Times' opener, and ""A Sad Man's Face"" is another stubbornly catchy piano-driven number. ""Steven James"" crams two or three of the album's best hooks into one song, and Suchan hits upon a charm here that overcomes his range (either cooing or yelping, and mostly the latter). The following batch of songs-- the woozy march of ""Trouble will Find You"" or the strum-happy ""Five Years of Madness""-- are fine, inoffensive songs, but are stingier with the swagger or melody. ""Get Us Sober"" switches rhythms and instruments so many times, it seems adrift in it's middling tempo. ""Blind Faith"", however, is a well-paced, confident ballad with surprising restraint, given the youthful exuberance on the rest of Hard Times. Its lyrics dip back into shallow political perspective (""The mothers want and need to know/why and where their sons must go""), but the performance is strong enough to let it slide. ""Isabelle""... well, ""Isabelle"" would make a great closer. Forget those two closing (er, opening) tracks, albums are too long these days anyways. Let that familiar pedal steel guitar finish a record that appropriates the spirit, if not the craft, of some oft-ignored giants.","Frontman Richard Suchan recruits former Get-Up Kids for what is now a full-time band.

Keep on the Sunny Side: June Carter Cash-- Her Life in Music,June Carter Cash,by: Stephen M.

June began singing with the Carter Family at age 9, when the precocious child was harmonizing on the family signature song, ""Keep on the Sunny Side"", and taking a solo with ""Oh Susannah"" (which she pronounces with an extra syllable-- ""oh Susie Anna""). The first disc in this two-disc set focuses on her early career, with songs performed by the Carter Family and the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle alongside solo tracks and duets. As much as it tracks the various lineups that played barn-dances around Appalachia during the 1930s and 1940s, this disc traces June's growing confidence as a singer and comedienne. That confidence is evident on tracks like ""I Guess I Told You Off"" and ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", with Homer & Jethro, and grows through later songs like ""Strange Woman"" and ""Without a Love to Call My Own"". Admittedly, many of these songs are mere trifles-- short entertainments full of virtuoso picking from her mother and sisters and lots of cornpone humor from June. This is no criticism: These songs are apt showcases for June's gracious wit and robust vocals, and their primary purpose was to rouse all-ages audiences, which makes them part country music, part vaudeville. Heard outside their original live context, these songs lose something essential but still sound complex and amusing, so we can only imagine the impact they had on their original listeners. June's third husband joins the Carter Family on the first disc's final track, a full version of ""Keep on the Sunny Side"", although Johnny's presence is hinted at on the previous track, ""Ring of Fire"", performed by the Carter Family. Gone are the mariachi horns and the gravity of Johnny's vocals; in this earlier version, a simple drum taps out a two-step rhythm and a chorale of voices testifies to the overwhelming risks of love like a church choir singing a hymn to God-- thankful, yet awed. According to the second disk of Keep On the Sunny Side, June and Johnny's inevitable collaboration didn't initially pay off. ""Jackson"" still sounds like a barnstormer, but its complex view of a cooling marriage offsets the sentimentality of their duets on Tim Hardin's worst song, ""If I Were a Carpenter"", and Kris Kristofferson's ""The Loving Gift""-- both of which suggest that a woman's ultimate act of love is procreation. Johnny also pops up in the jokey ""Slewfoot"", which, coming so soon after their duets, seems to be exploiting their very public relationship. But really, it's just another vaudeville song like ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", only this time performed in the studio instead of on the stage. That distinction is important. Despite its overbearing production, the studio material on the second disk isn't necessarily inferior to her earlier live songs, but it does afford her far fewer opportunities to showcase her outsize personality. Often she inhabits characters-- like the reformed harlot in ""The Shadow of a Lady"" or the woeful gunman in ""East Virginia Blues""-- but never with the liveliness and commitment with which she played Aunt Polly or Little Junie. June needed an audience, her autoharp, and a few agile pickers and fiddlers. But she had her moments in the studio, such as the duet with her husband on ""Far Banks of the River Jordan"", which proves eerily prophetic. And the final three tracks, taken from the last few years of her life, reveal a gritty authority in her aged voice. Keep On the Sunny Side ends with yet another version of the title track, recorded in 2001. At 73 June sings those lyrics with the same determined pluck as she did at 9, revealing an artist whose hopefulness proved as solid and indefatigable as her voice.","Two-disc set follows Cash's career from her work with the Carter Family and the Carter Sisters in the 1930s and '40s through her solo tracks and duets.

Shake Some Action,Flamin' Groovies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be84c0084474cd0c2ed6/1:1/w_160/90fb01c1.gif,2005-09-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3286-shake-some-action/,SireSire,"The Flamin' Groovies were a band out of time. Formed in 1965, they played lean, hard-driving boogie and had a sharp-cut, stylish image in a San Francisco scene that was more about free love, secondhand clothes, and 28-minute modal jams. That raucous, explosive version of the band lasted until 1972, when original vocalist Roy Loney left and guitarist Cyril Jordan took the reins, moving them to Britain. There, they hooked up with roots rocker Dave Edmunds, who produced a session for them that pointed toward a distinctly different path, one deeply indebted to the British Invasion sounds that everyone else had moved on from. Amongst their Stones-influenced cuts lay two of the most exquisite power-pop tracks of the 70s, ""You Tore Me Down"" and ""Shake Some Action"", which gave its title to the album the band made in 1976 after a lengthy recording hiatus. Shake Some Action was in every sense both a comeback and a re-invention, and it's been rightly championed by collectors and critics extolling its effortless pop perfection. If it had been released in 1966, it could have been a smash and a popular landmark, but a decade later, the Spector-loving sound and Beatle-loving songcraft (they even covered ""Misery"") sank like a stone in the marketplace. It would be one thing if the record merely aped an era the band had spent playing other music, but the Groovies had the songs and nuanced understanding of the music needed to elevate themselves above pastiche. ""Shake Some Action"" itself is a minor masterpiece of jangling, harmony-soaked guitar pop, an instantly memorable song that piles wave upon wave of hooks on a solid backbeat, all wrapped up in big, wet reverb. It's a classic in every way except one: Almost nobody's heard it. A shame, because it's just the tip of the iceberg on an album stuffed with great tunes. There are six covers amongst the 14 tracks, following the blueprint of the original British Invasion records, and with the exception of ""Sometimes"" and ""Misery"", the band uses these as their license to revisit their more raucous rootsötheir take on ""St. Louis Blues"" is especially good, though they're not as convincing on Chuck Berry's ""Don't You Lie to Me""-- their version just doesn't have the angry bite it needs to succeed. The band's other originals, mostly penned by Jordan and fellow singer/guitarist Chris Wilson, range from the majestic ballad ""I Saw Her""-- a slow, spooky, even operatic track stuffed with the band's best harmonies and some truly knockout lead guitar-- to the speedy rocker ""Please Please Girl"" (one guess whose early singles it sounds like). ""Teenage Confidential"" is another magisterial ballad, though it harkens even further back, with the ring of 50s tear-jerkers and teen idol pop. ""You Tore Me Down"" and ""I Can't Hide"" are sweeping ear candy with to-die-for melodies and accomplished solos. One thing that's striking, considering when the album was released, is its efficiency and brevity. In an era where five songs in 45 minutes wasn't uncommon, they jammed 14 into a 36-minute runtime, meaning that the album is a concentrated sugar bomb. This has lead to some revisionist positioning of the band as forebears of the punk explosion, but it's a specious claim at best, even if the Ramones did open for them on a tour of Europe. The Groovies were simply cut from a completely different cloth. It's about time this album got a proper reissue treatment in the band's home country, and the DBK Works people have done a great job putting together an informative package, though don't come expecting any bonus material, because there is none-- in fact, it's thought that the extra tapes from the album sessions were destroyed. Remastering helps immensely, too, clearing up the sound a great deal over previous CD issues of the albumömy old copy was an Australian import that sounded like garbage. Remastering can't actually change the production of the record, though, and if there's any complaint to be had with Shake Some Action, it's that Edmunds' work at the boards is sometimes too hazyöhe was recording them like a harder rock band than they were at that point, and truthfully, a slicker sound would have helped. The flawed production, however, does not dim the quality of the album. Shake Some Action is, quite simply, one of the best guitar pop albums ever made, and its lack of popular notoriety is more a symptom of its timing than anything else (it's tough not to think that the band's name made things a little harder, too). Hopefully, having a high-quality version of it readily available will help more people to hear it. The Groovies made only one more good album (Flamin' Groovies Now!), before embarking on a confusing series of relocations and reunions, but Shake Some Action stands as their crowning achievement.","LP of classic Spector-loving sound and Beatles-loving songcraft is deservedly re-released.

No Direction Home: The Soundtrack: The Bootleg Series Vol. 7,Bob Dylan,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c351eb335119a49ed6a7/1:1/w_160/cfd534ae.jpg,2005-09-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2501-no-direction-home-the-soundtrack-the-bootleg-series-vol-7/,Columbia,"In his 2004 memoir Chronicles, Bob Dylan writes of his time in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s: ""Down in the Village, nothing seemed wrong. Life was not complex. Everybody was looking for openings. Some would get 'em and they'd be gone and others never did. Mine was coming, but just not yet."" No Direction Home traces Dylan's career from the summer of 1961 (when Dylan first moved to New York) through the 1966 release of Blonde on Blonde, and doubles as the soundtrack to the Martin Scorsese documentary of the same name, which will be aired on PBS later this month. Unlike the previous three installments of the Bootleg Series, which captured complete live performances, No Direction Home is a collection of demos, alternate takes, and live recordings, ranging from a barely audible ""When I Got Trouble"", recorded in 1959 by one of Dylan's high school classmates (making it, in all probability, the first original song Dylan ever laid to tape, all strummy guitar and dim, somersaulting blues-vocals) to the raucous, full-band explosion of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (the infamous ""Judas!"" version, which also appeared on the fourth volume of the Bootleg Series, Live 1966). The songs are laid out chronologically, designed to let listeners see exactly how far Bob Dylan came in six years. 2005 has seen a new glut of Dylan insight, and Chronicles, No Direction Home, and Live at the Gaslight 1962 (a companion piece to No Direction Home, presently available only at your local Starbucks, and sadly worth the stench of burned milk and spilled espresso) are impossibly telling when swallowed together: the end result is a comprehensive glimpse into Dylan-at-21, an oddly detailed examination of a perpetually misunderstood artist. ""This Land Is Your Land"", recorded in 1961 at New York's Carnegie Chapter Hall (little sister to the famed concert space) is an earnest homage to Dylan's beloved muse Woody Guthrie, growled with endearing conviction. ""This Land"" is followed by a wobbly-voiced ""Song to Woody"" (""I'm singing you this song, but I can't sing enough/ 'Cause there's not many men who've done the things that you've done""); Dylan's unfettered admiration for Guthrie's work is perfectly (and prominently) posed, captured six years before Dylan perched himself on Guthrie's deathbed. Both feature Dylan's early caw and watchful strums, his veneration for Guthrie's politics and practices heartbreakingly rendered. Dylan has always been an especially convincing protest singer, and given the post-Katrina events of the last week, his heartfelt rendition of ""This Land is Your Land"" is almost too much to take: it may be every Kindergarten class' premier singalong, but ""This Land"" is still one of the most elegant and subversive folk songs ever written. Guthrie's anthem was scribbled in terse response to Irving Berlin's comparably one-sided ""God Bless America,"" and the song's telling fourth verse (typically censored in service of patriotism) seems just as apt now as it did in 1940: ""One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple/ By the Relief Office I saw my people/ As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering/ If God Blessed America for me."" Appropriately, ""Song to Woody"" features Dylan's response: ""It's sick and it's hungry/ It's tired and it's torn/ It looks like it's dying and its hardly been born/ But hey Woody Guthrie, I know that you know."" Guthrie and Dylan's distress is palpable, thick: Nudge your dial, put CNN on mute, and sob yourself to sleep. (Don't stop when you get to ""Masters of War"", or, worst of all, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall""). An early demo of ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" (sometimes circulated as a part of the Witmark Demos) sees Dylan cawing with atypical prettiness, his guitar nimble and soft. Recorded in Lou Levy's office at Columbia (""I opened my guitar case, took the guitar out and began fingering the strings. Lou had put a microphone on the desk in front of me and plugged the cord into one of the tape recorders, all the while chomping on a big, exotic stogie,"" Dylan writes), ""Don't Think Twice"" justifies the purchase price of No Direction Home all on its own: Levy had Dylan recording original songs, which would eventually be transposed into sheet music and offered around to other artists, Brill Building-style. Accordingly, Dylan seems less concerned with perpetuating his own mythology than with capturing the grim soul of the song, and we're rewarded with three and a half minutes of pure, un-smirking, alarmingly honest Dylan (read: three minutes more than usual). Disc Two features some outstandingly weird studio outtakes, including Take 9 of Highway 61 Revisited's ""Tombstone Blues"", complete with loping fuzztone bass, backing vocals, noodling by guitarist Mike Bloomfield of the Butterfield Band, and Dylan's own giggles. Largely electric, Disc Two also offers a source-tape recording of Dylan's infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance of ""Maggie's Farm"", where he plugged-in, brazenly defaming the acoustic-only preservationists present, most of whom had comprised much of his fanbase (supposedly, Pete Seeger was hovering nervous backstage, muttering to himself and threatening to cut the power lines.) The Newport Folk Festival had long admitted a thorny relationship with amplifiers, even when the music demanded magnification-- festival organizers often stuck howling blues musicians with tiny, whispering stacks, smugly denying their right to wail. Even though Dylan had released the largely electric Bringing It All Back Home earlier that year, ""Maggie's Farm"" was ultimately received with a mixture of limp, knee-jerk applause and wildly dissatisfied boos-- and folk music changed. No Direction Home is fairly essential listening for Dylan enthusiasts and an interesting history lesson for everyone else. Not only is American politics skewered and forked apart, but one songwriter's artistic evolution is laid out bare. As ever, Dylan reminds us that there is plenty left to learn.","Seventh volume in the Bootleg Series collects demos, alternate takes, and live recordings, and doubles as the soundtrack to a forthcoming Martin Scorsese documentary.

Veneer,José González,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c023abf31b7dc71563fc/1:1/w_160/e0ba6965.jpg,2005-09-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3682-veneer/,MuteImperialMuteImperial,"It's taken two years for the debut album by singer/songwriter José González (Swedish, obv.) to reach these shores, and it's easy to see what nudged it here. González's sparse recordings showcase hushed, double-tracked vocals, haunted imagery, and a clearly gifted classical guitarist. His gripping acoustic cover of countryfolk the Knife's electro-pop ""Heartbeats"" was even a minor hit in his homeland. An ethereal, sometimes-aloof troubadour, González will sing you to sleep and then dash off under cover of night, leaving only cold-sweat nightmares and an unopened bottle of sweet vermouth. Yup, two years, and on Veneer, González suggests he'd kinda like to stick around for a few more. Permanence is a pressing concern: With bongos and a hint of bossa nova, ""Remain"" emphasizes perseverance, while the scant lyrics of handclap-enhanced ""Lovestain"" complain of the marks you can't just shout out of you heart, maaan. The arrangements are full of Nick Drake-style open tunings (""Stay in the Shade"", in particular, can't escape the shadow of that introvert-folk patron saint) and only a forlorn trumpet on closer ""Broken Arrow"" disrupting the guit/vox/maybe-tasteful-percussion train to Starbucks-comp paydirt. As with like-minded songstress Emiliana Torrini, González is at his best when he forces a personality onto his faceless raw materials. The distinctive finger-picking on ""Crosses"", the best original song on the disc, rises like the spires of a Gothic cathedral, giving form to lyrics about a redemptive light in the darkness (any religious inferences, meanwhile, are left entirely to the listener). By comparison, sotto voce opener ""Slow Moves"" tries a little too hard to sound like its quiet-is-the-new-loud forebears, with a meta-chorus too wispy to hold tight 'til morning: ""My moves are slow/ But soon they'll know"". González's aforementioned ""Heartbeats"" cover is nearly as spine-tingling as the original, if not its frenetic Rex the Dog remix. Echoing M. Ward's ""Let's Dance"", Iron & Wine's ""Such Great Heights"", and Frente!'s ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", González strips the electro-pop down to an acoustic lullaby, laying bare a powerful melody and deceptively evocative lyrics about love, regret and nostalgia. González has also covered Kylie Minogue's ""Hand on Your Heart"", and the gulf that remains between these must-hears and his self-composed material is significant. González knows a great song when he hears it, and he plays a mean guitar, but in 2003 he was still more raw than the overseas buzz suggested; Veneer is nice, but it may just scratch the surface.","Swedish singer/songwriter is making a name for himself with his Nick Drake-like classical guitar and vocals, and an acoustic cover of the Knife's electro-pop gem ""Heartbeats"".

Fabric23,Ivan Smagghe,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bf9d034d5c69bf35f8/1:1/w_160/7e1b400f.gif,2005-09-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7830-fabric23/,Fabric,"Ivan the Terrible is almost too perfect a poster boy for the current state of electrowhatever, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard and general air of swarthy French sleaziness. As one half of Black Strobe, he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a DJ he's defined his strain of electrohouse (better names on a postcard, as always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog eyes?) Fabric23 doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true shop-blurb style. As my boy Phil noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone is worshipping the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are dragging their knuckles down. Ivan does know a bassline when he hears it, usually in short blurts of boom that occasionally reach out to slap you awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing a coastal town in mid-July. Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit) is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!"" is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. Michael Mayer's ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm surprised he went with the clicking melodies of DJ Koze's ""The Geklöppel Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"". Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of Konrad Black's ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the bulk of the mix. Fabric23 is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not all the time, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black holes of good taste and excessive abstraction. Unfortunately, it's a weird kind of rock purism Smagghe leans on, not all that different from the excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's. Is one anthem too much to ask Ivan? Or am I missing the point?","Black Strobe ace brings cock rock to the dancefloor.

Drawn Dead,Hair Police,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15d13d197565213bbbd/1:1/w_160/18ada2b1.gif,2005-09-01 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3985-drawn-dead/,Hanson,"Drawn Dead is one of a pair of full-length Hair Police albums that arrived virtually simultaneously earlier this year-- the other being the supremely discomfiting Constantly Terrified on Troubleman Unlimited. And though each of these releases offers a unique and valuable entry to the prolific Kentucky/Michigan trio's ever-suppurating noise, for my ticket Drawn Dead is the slightly more compelling of the two. It's almost inarguably Hair Police's most doggedly single-minded release to date, as its four untitled tracks combine to essentially form one continuous ashen flow, an unearthly current that represents the group's most self-assured departure yet from the more punk-centric splatter of earlier releases like 2002's Blow Out Your Blood. Recorded live with no overdubs, Drawn Dead pitilessly captures a doomed sonic wreckage that Hair Police have succinctly described as ""the sound of a burning human body."" Though performed by the trio's regular line-up of Mike Connelly (Wolf Eyes), Trevor Tremaine, and Robert Beatty, the instrumental line-up here is unorthodox even by the group's nebulous standards. Without a true percussive in sight, drummer Tremaine joins Connelly on guitar and occasional vocals, while Beatty manipulates the proceedings electronically in real-time. But the description of their process or set-up alone does little to prepare the listener for the album's patiently devised ambient crawl, since few of these generated drones and scrapes originate from easily pinpointed sources. Instead, in a manner reminiscent of Merzbow's grainiest abstractions, the group's various thrums here frequently coalesce into a single unified black-lit beam that sweeps scythe-like across the countryside, mowing everything in its trajectory down at the ankles. Viewed from a safe distance, the surfaces of Drawn Dead can appear almost lifelessly monolithic and static, but upon closer investigation one can see that these tracks actually teem with movement and action. Over the course of the album's first two tracks, mud-caked walls of feedback and crackling distortion build, then collapse, then build again, while unsettling echoes, pauses, and stereo-panning techniques ensure perpetual listener disorientation. And just as you're beginning to get a feel for this murky new habitat, the 11-minute third track enters, raining shrieks of industrial detritus and disembodied spectral cries over the sickly, low-lying amplifier growls, before the brief finale sets everything spinning off in the undertow of its dark tide. It's an impressive performance in its own right, but when taken in conjunction with Constantly Terrified it signals that Hair Police are open for engagement with any mutated extremity of noise that crosses their collective snares, making their future possible directions seem virtually limitless.","The better of the two engaging albums released this year by the noise band.

Stars of CCTV,Hard-Fi,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1785e6ef959693236f8/1:1/w_160/fefcc9df.jpg,2005-09-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4011-stars-of-cctv/,Atlantic,"In his caustic riposte regarding A Certain Ratio, Pitchfork staffer Jess Harvell astutely suggested that reissue culture is like archaeology-- no matter how artifact-rich an excavation site might seem, there comes a time when nothing remains but dirt and some rocks. This analogy can easily apply to music of the moment, but instead of ""archaelogical dig,"" think ""gold rush"" or ""dot-com boom."" Prospecting magnate discoveres heretofore untapped resource and makes a nice chunk of change from exploiting said resource, and suddenly everyone and their pet therapist is out there with a sifting pan and a domain name, trying to get a piece of the pie. In case you just joined us: A chic bandwagon to hop on board right now is this family-sized ""whatever the hell you want to call the deluge of alternative post-punky new-wave"" jalopy. If you're like me, you'll gladly go back for seconds more often than not. If you're like Jess, you'll suckerpunch the chef and piss in the fish tank. And regardless of quality, the signal-to-noise ratio is going to favor the static. For every Killer success or act of Bravery, there are numerous acts that go straight from Boardwalk (or Baltic Avenue) to the dollar bin, left waiting for their reclamation at the hands of next generation's LTM. And, like Jess said, sometimes these folks end up on the margins because they were marginal in the first place. So, yeah, Hard-Fi: class-conscious lads from the UK with the right records in their collection do it themselves, get the kids and press to sing and dance along, then get a sugar daddy to help them do it on a grand scale despite the dodgy band name. And, hey, now they can add ""Mercury Prize nominee"" to their CV. One of the first sounds on the album is the toot from a melodica drenched in echo; now you know why I bothered with the introduction. Despite some interesting accoutrements (tasteful trumpets yay, bombastic strings meh) and some game attempts at eclecticism (acoustic pluck wicked, piano ballad oh geez), Stars of CCTV is of a part with the varied guitar-driven stuff that their fellow Mercury nominees-- Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs, etc.,-- have offered folks this past year. Their ""Take Me Out"" is called ""Hard to Beat"", which shows that, between shots of Entertainment! and London Calling, Daft Punk has in fact been played at their house. This example notwithstanding, Hard-Fi's attempts to pitch woo to hot girls in love aren't as successful as their paeans to working for the weekend. To wit: ""Living For the Weekend"", a sonic twin to ""Hard to Beat"", though its disco magic points more towards Donna Summer than to French guys in Battlestar Galactica helmets. Hard-Fi fight for their right to party (""Unnecessary Trouble""), they struggle to make ends meet (""Cash Machine""), and they yearn to get the hell outta Dodge (""Tied Up Too Tight""). And, occasionally, they wonder about going to war and being under constant scrutiny and ending up in prison. It's this sense of the personal politic that separates Hard-Fi from the rest of the nu-wave pack. Clearly, the Clash received a few more spins than the Go4. Instead of offering hi-falutin' conceptual treatises, Hard-Fi infuses their message with a grounded sense of place that's not just tied to London. The search for culprits in the wake of the London subway bombings lends a bittersweet taste to the twerpy sarcasm in the album's title track (""We're the stars of CCTV/ Making movies out on the street"")-- this sentiment could just as easily apply to any number of invasive acts carried out under the aegis of the Patriot Act. The marginalized West London kids in ""Tied Up Too Tight"" could be the kids from down the block or one town over. And when HM Young Offender Institution & Remand Centre Feltham sings out, it sounds like the long-predicted riot could begin at any place, at any time. In other words: If you find this in the dollar bin next year, consider yourself very lucky.","Re-assembled and vastly improved take on the UK neo-wave band's indie debut.

Howl,Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2eeea9e61561daa4b7c/1:1/w_160/4695c5ff.jpg,2005-09-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/773-howl/,RCA,"In 2004, months after the release of their sophomore record Take Them On, On Your Own, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club was unceremoniously dropped by longtime label Virgin; around the same time, founding drummer Nick Jago slinked away from the group, purportedly incapable of handling the rigor of a major label publicity push (or of showing up to gigs on time). Since its inception, BRMC has seemed oddly well-primed for anticlimactic dissolution, but rather than slumping away from the stage, leather jackets retired to mothball-stocked closets, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has opted to regroup and pilfer a new musical spectrum, this time tackling classic American blues, country, and gospel. The trio has traded in their pedals and sneers for slides and acoustics. Guitarist/vocalist Robert Turner has reverted back to his given name, Robert Levon Been (originally changed to distance Been from his father, Michael Been of 1980s rockers the Call). Vago is back, smiling peacefully. Dunked in the Mississippi, BRMC are reborn. There may be something awkwardly rote about BRMC's sudden interest in capturing gothic country goo (""Fault Line"" features an extended harmonica solo; T-Bone Burnett cops multiple gratis in the liner notes), but Howl is still considerably more compelling than the bellowing, Jesus and Mary Chain retreads the band formerly relied on. All the Oasis posturing and NME-drool puddles made it easy to forget that BRMC were actually born in blue-sky California, and their new album title, which groaningly salutes periodic San Francisco-resident Allen Ginsberg, gently reminds listeners of the band's scraggly American roots-- which is appropriate, given all the rising-south thievery BRMC is indulging here for the very first time. The snag is, heartless posturing is still heartless posturing, no matter how sharp the change of scenery: at its best, Howl twists slide guitar and acoustic strums into vaguely convincing neo-Band jams, and at its worst, it sounds like cartoon-Americana (shockingly, unplugging your guitar and cawing about Jesus doesn't make you country.) Still, it's that tension-- between classic BRMC bluster and squeaky Delta organics-- that makes Howl an unusually interesting record. Howl is predominantly acoustic, but so sopped with fuzz and echo that it actually manages to sound much bigger than it is. BRMC have hinted at Jack White-ian fetishes before, but Howl is still a remarkable departure for the band, and their trademark druggy dirges are noticeably absent here. ""Devil's Waitin'"" (sort of embarrassingly) mines Johnny Cash's lyrical stash, all Jesus and prison, proclamations about life and the Devil growled over careful acoustic strums and tiny wisps of pedal steel. The song's closing coyote Howls-- bayed gently, with cactus-stuck, old west conviction-- give way to a three-man hum-along, and finally slip into a gospel vocal swell (even the echoes seem to scream ""We're in church!"") Lead single ""Ain't No Easy Way"" is jammed with raucous steel guitar riffs and harmonica canoodling, all country-rock stomp and barn dance fervor. BRMC's natural penchant for the loud and bombastic work well here; surprisingly, ""Ain't No Easy Way"" is a perfectly convincing throwdown, oddly free of awkward contrivances. Much of ""Gospel Song"" is whispered, slipping in and out of thick full-band buzz, plodding on and on but never actually landing anywhere particularly interesting; opener ""Shuffle Your Feet"" starts with an a capella ""Time won't save our souls!"" whine, before slipping into a handclapping, honky-tonk rhythm. There might be a tiny hint of desperation fueling much of Howl, but ultimately the record is an oddly earnest experiment for BRMC, and once they learn to drop the weird, obligatory signifiers, their new direction may actually prove more fruitful than their last: Cramming together brash rock snottiness with meek country hollers is hardly uncharted territory (not that it matters), but BRMC's particular mash-up still makes for a strangely intriguing party.","One-time JAMC tribute act follows its disappointing second LP with a more Americana-influenced and assured release.

Most of their pun-filled song titles are mouse-related-- either dealing with cheese, traps, or the rodents themselves. If it weren't for the disturbing barrage of noise on ASSPhIXXXEATATESHUN, the whole thing might come off as either oddly cute, blandly gimmicky, or as some sort of PETA protest. But the only things the White Mice seem to be protesting are good taste, traditional song structure, and anything remotely resembling a melody. The noise-metal miscreants use drums, bass, and an oscillator to create a gloriously god-awful racket. Most of the songs clock in at around two minutes and follow the grindcore style of relentlessly bludgeoning the listener over the head with brutal drums and distorted-beyond-recognition instruments. The vocals, which are buried in the mix, seem to consist primarily of howls and wails, at times so seamlessly blending with the squealing feedback that it's difficult to tell there's a human behind them. The songs that come closest to having a structure are the longer ones, comparatively speaking. ""Limburger Baby"" spends an echoing minute building up a spacey, sci-fi atmosphere before busting wide open into a full-on assault. ""Mouse Trap"" begins with swirling oscillator tones leading into a jerky rhythm that plays out for the bulk of the song. The title can even been heard over and over beneath the horror of alarm-clock buzz and booming bass guitar. Similarly, ""Slo Poison"" suits its name, creeping through three-and-a-half minutes of sludge as if it's slowly shutting down your nervous system. While everything on the disc could certainly qualify as noise, there are several tracks that wear that label more obviously than others. Opener ""Foreskin Rug"" utilizes sliced-and-diced rushes of buzz-saw tones on top of slo-mo rumble. ""Dieorhearama"" picks up this theme nine songs later and adds the swoosh of back-masked drums and squealing feedback on top. The disc's final track is ""Microjackass"", which spans almost 50 minutes (over twice the length of the other 10 tracks combined). Over its first four minutes the song builds in speed and intensity before fading to static; by minute five, silence has set in. It's not until 43 minutes later that we get the final burst: a quick blast of a repeating drum and bass beat, ringing oscillator tones, and a telephone operator delivering a voice-mail message. While it's been a common gag since the early 90s to include a bonus track at the tail end of a CD, forcing the listener to wear out the fast-forward button accessing the track, it seems here that the silence is a part of the song. The White Mice want you to think you've escaped harm, and at the last conceivable moment, the trap snaps down on your neck.","Latest from Load's masked, bloodied, mouse-fixated group.

Some tracks here forget their melodies but valiantly gadget their way through: Strip a Sufjan song of everything but its chirpy horns, woody blocks, and xylo phones, and you might have a ""Muesli"". (You are encouraged to read this last sentence in a Jeff Foxworthy voice.) And perhaps you forgot about the existence of the band Tortoise; ""(She's in) Dry Dock Now"" has not only the courage to glitch-pluck its strings, but the prescience to prefuse the ones and twos-- a Tortoise 73 cover before the Tortoise 73 original post-drops? I was double-fisting sandwiches in the VIP at the time, but I think I heard dudes play this song at Intonation. When the Shock does muster a strong melody, he makes a synth-pop jam out of it, and those are Maritime's better moments. There's this band with Hollywood-branch Amoeba Records employees, I think they're called the Ray Makers-- anyway, for you L.A. cats still bummed about my Weezer tracks review from six fucking months ago, that reference point is my atonement. ""Six Foolish Fisherman"" fakes the funk, but ""Luck Shield"" is ""Mr. Magic"" in neon, with Wurlitzer-like flutters on the head and a killer quiet bells flip. Sorry though, Pink's is an ugly man's Nathan's. There's a love song, too-- ""Mistaken Tourist""-- and it's anxious to fill my IDM love song quota (0.75 love songs). But the soft squelch lead and pulled strings and cutesy bells come off a bit too well-intentioned, especially coming from an act whose very namesake was, shall we say, Veneris monumentum nefandae.","4AD IDM group make like folktronica meets a fictional Tortoise 73.

Black Blues (Acoustic) / (Electric),Keiji Haino,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17eeb335119a49ed57d/1:1/w_160/89a24a5a.gif,2005-08-31 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4018-black-blues-acoustic-electric/,DSA,"If you've caught Keiji Haino live, you've likely seen the old master build a sturdy wall of sound and look pretty fucking amazing while doing it. The 50-something Japanese musician's a legend in the noise/improv scene, and though his hair's taken on gray streaks, he seems otherwise ageless in his trademark black leather and black sunglasses. Often pigeonholed as a shadowy guitar screamer, Haino claims to have mastered over 80 noisemakers including digital theremin, air synth, hurdy-gurdy, wave drum, all sorts of percussion, and various indigenous instruments. His inclusive aesthetic blows between minimalism, folk, medievalism, and sublime drone; he also leads his own cover band, Aihiyo, and the psych-rock power duo Fushitsusha. Comfortable alone or with an avant posse, he's collaborated with Ruins, Faust, Boris, Charles Gayle, Merzbow, Jim O'Rourke, and Derek Bailey, among others. On his most recent pair of enigmatic recordings, Haino keeps to himself, showcasing his vocal prowess alongside often surprisingly clean, mostly processed guitar. Focusing on African-American blues, Black Blues is a pair of albums, though they aren't packaged together. It's unclear why Haino didn't opt for a double disc, but fans will want to hear both. The tracklists are identical and the only difference in the packaging are reversed/mirrored covers. Musically, one's quiet (""acoustic""), the other loud (""electric""). If you need help in the store, print out the following and bring it with you: On the ""acoustic"" version Haino's looking to the left and on the ""electric"" version he's looking to the right. Keeping them apart's fine (the confusion's kinda great), but it's also worthwhile experiencing the loud and soft in interaction, observing how intentionality can morph and then re-shred even a recognizable standard like Blind Lemon Jefferson's ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". Whether enjoyed together or singularly, the albums make great use of silence and space (the electric in a more jarring, less pin drop manner). On the ""acoustic"" collection, Haino's spacious playing brings to mind Loren Connors (a past collaborator) and New Zealander Roy Montgomery. It can get very quiet: Parts of 13-minute ""Black Eyes"" are so immensely whispered, the stereo needs to be pinned as high as possible to catch the ambience. Vocally, Haino's a psychedelic solitaire exhaling black and white. In ""The Town in Black Fog"" he whispers evocatively into your ear, a guitar strumming in the distance. Some tracks aren't as secretive: Everything's upfront on ""I Don't Want to Know"", a ballad with chords that drift across into each other no matter how carefully they're spaced. Haino's voice is often evocative, even pretty. The tour de force is the previously mentioned ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". (As on a few of the tracks, the guitar doesn't sound especially ""acoustic."") His voice registers as near falsetto while he lethargically strums; when Haino brings it down a notch, it's amazing to witness one of our noisiest guitarists turns out moth-wing ethereality. When he ""plugs in"" for set two, an angry demon emerges in a different part of the graveyard. Seconds into ""Black Petal""'s opening chords there are already stab wounds; eventually Haino unleashes absolutely anguished screams. The electro ""Black Eyes""'s three minutes briefer than its acoustic-minded sister; Haino knows how to play loud softly, so its guitars are layered and sustained but subtle. He approaches Mecca Normal slashing on the catchy ""I Don't Want To Know"", which is as rock as it gets. And the best? Again, it's ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". This take explodes with an anguished vocal aneurysm and deliberate, reverberating guitar waves. It delivers a fitting purification rite before a high-pitched swath of feedback punk slaps the finale. To say Black Blues are mysterious records is an understatement. That they aren't for everyone is redundant. The vicious loudness delivers a few wonders of texture, raw rasp, and might be recognized first in the crowd due to its forceful attitude. But, really, it's the delicate acoustic movement-- subtle, enormous, secretive, inaudible-- that best channels and transmogrifies classic blues into exorcism.","The Japanese guitar legend offers both an acoustic and electric version of his latest set of songs.

Supernature,Goldfrapp,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf60eb335119a49ed1f5/1:1/w_160/9c4026a8.jpg,2005-08-31 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3506-supernature/,Mute,"I should probably like this more than I actually do. Who doesn't want to get behind Alison Goldfrapp and company? She's nothing if not on the ball, having transformed herself from elegant mid-90s Orbital cooer to elegant late-90s spook to an equally timely role-- something like a cross between Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, between Annie and Siouxsie Sioux, between Rachel Stevens and Beth Gibbons, the evil-twin model of the shimmery dancefloor princess-bot. And Supernature kicks off with that flag flying high, on ""Ooh La La"": some hard schaffel, some hand-clapping glam-rock stomp, some dangerously icy taunting, and enough Germanic electro-house action to make you want to drop it like it's cold, ruthlessly efficient, and strangely angular. Why do I have a sick suspicion that this is how awesome Peaches thinks she sounds? So I do half-go for it, from that first rush of ice to the veins to the dots of old-model cabaret spook that crop up later, and from there through the buzz and pulse of the inbetween. Witchy English vibes, analog synth surgery, superhuman icy-vulnerable vocals, and production that sounds alternately like high-polish chrome and a sucking black hole: What more do I usually ask for? Well, something, obviously, because somewhere along the line I lose it. Maybe it's the part where Alison wants to ""ride on a white horse,"" though I suppose there's both a half-decent hero/heroin joke and a T. Rex reference in there. Maybe it's the part where I remember that I have Gary Numan and Siouxsie albums I still haven't listened to it enough. Or maybe it's just the peculiar plaint of the electro dance-pop full-length: the sound of those mid-tempo album-completing tracks. They're effortlessly organized, full of so much dense trebly shimmer and helium swooning and sighing that you actually zone out and stop hearing them, right up until you realize your ears hurt a little from taking it all in. They're loads of effort poured into a product that winds up sounding like nothing in particular, immaculate synth arrangements not quite making up for the fact that the song will neither bang and swell nor relax into a dreamy lull. If Alison were Kylie, she could at least spice things up by switching modes-- sunny here, earnest here, then back to machine-tooled intimidation. Alison, being Alison, has to stay all witchy all the time. And there's the non-shocker: This is sure to sound better in the variegated sweep of a good DJ mix-- something that's not, given the present currency of ""electro-house,"" so difficult to come across. The bangers here will sound fab on the pop ends of said mixes, ""Ooh La La"" owning all. The tracks that lapse back into Goldfrapp's old Felt Mountain electronic-chanteuse mold will sound fine in your apartment. (""U Never Know"" and ""Let it Take You"" make a gorgeous break from the ultra-dense buzz, getting progressively softer, silkier, and more minimal.) But plenty of these tracks keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop. Which makes this pretty much what you'd expect: the prime-time flagship of glammy electroid dancefloor pop, curiously expensive-sounding and accessible to all, but strangely stripped of the functionalism of the dance record and the full thrills of pop. Sometimes that lands it in the sweet spot. Just as often, though, it seems to have forgotten what in the world it was meant to offer in the first place.","Cabaret spook, glam-rock stomp, and Germanic electro-house from should-be star Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory.

The Unseen,Quasimoto,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20b13d1975652138797/1:1/w_160/2be3b3c5.jpg,2005-08-31 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6613-the-unseen/,Stones Throw,"When The Unseen was released in 2000 as the solo debut from Lootpack MC/producer Madlib, no one could have known that it would be just the first album in an arm's-length discography that would cover everything from live jazz to Doom and Dilla collaborations, mostly to gushing critical acclaim. At the time, it was simply a quirky leftfield hip-hop record by a guy who burned grass like a wildfire and lived in Peanut Butter Wolf's basement-- like literally lived in the basement studio known as the Bomb Shelter. No one knew that Madlib preferred the solitude of the studio to pretty much anything else and that records flowed from his mind and sampler at a dizzying pace. Now, thanks to endless profiles and album reviews, we know, and it makes The Unseen even more interesting. What once seemed a crafty producer's gimmick now sounds more like the imaginary friend of a shy dude who needed someone to talk to in the studio while he chain-smoked blunts. Reefer Madness? Probably, but wildly entertaining, as well, imagining Madlib sitting in a basement making songs all day everyday and getting so bored with himself that he finds a way to put a pig-nosed yellow hippo on record. And most of what he says under that persona is crazy shit, outlandish, hilarious fiction. Exactly what everyone stands around thinking about when he's got a helium balloon pinched in his fingers is what comes out of Lord Quas' mouth. We all know profanity is crass, violence a nuisance, and misogyny quite boring, but dude, his voice sounds funny when he says it. Whether it's the grandiose self-shout-outs, ludicrous threats, or adolescent come-ons, Quas is Webster with pimp juice while Madlib leans on the wall, mumbling affirmations and encouragement, and if you want to justify the content to your stuffy friends just tell them the pitch-shifted vocals are Madlib's commentary on the mental immaturity and irresponsibility of typical hip-hop subject matter. Of course, the main attraction of any Madlib record is his production, and The Unseen holds up particularly well because Madlib hasn't changed this particular strain of his beatmaking all that much. Instead of tinkering with his style, he creates a new one. When he wanted to do some live jazz, he did Yesterday's New Quintet. Street bangers went to the Jaylib album. Pop remixes, reggae mixtapes, instrumental 12""s, nothing stays on paper with Madlib. So anyone who slobbered over Madvillainy or The Further Adventures of Lord Quas won't be disappointed by the now five-year-old production, nor should they skip Lootpack's Soundpieces or MED's Push Comes to Shove. If anything, The Unseen is a better ""album"" than Further Adventures because the compositions are more fleshed-out, more cohesive and, well, more. Madlib has a short attention span, but he kept most of the songs to almost three minutes here without much junk. The jazz and soul samples are as obscure and well-selected as ever, with Madlib's particular style of chopping a drum sample keeping the beat from becoming a bore. The skits and interludes play to the mood, and the seamless transitions, which usually include a bonus beat or two, echo the give 'em more of DJ Premier of Gang Starr. I can't say for sure why The Unseen is being re-released, other than Madlib didn't a have another record ready this month. It's a nice treat for the Serato kids to have the full instrumentals on one CD, which is included. And if there's anything to be learned from George Lucas, it's that trusting the public to remember how awesome you are is a fool's paradise. Legacies are constructed, and with the new Quasimoto album still on the New Release wall, it doesn't hurt Madlib or Stones Throw to jog some memories. I'm sure Quas would say, ""Buy my shit, or I'll cut your head off and smoke green out your socketholes,"" or something to that effect.","Stones Throw expands and reissues Madlib's 2000 solo bow.

Invisible Ones,Orenda Fink,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bebdabf31b7dc71561c2/1:1/w_160/29fa99c4.jpg,2005-08-30 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3348-invisible-ones/,Saddle Creek,"With Maria Taylor's 11:11 serving as de facto Azure Ray, anything Orenda Fink churns out could only be bonus, right? Considering the consistency of the group's canon, it seems at worst you're getting double the fix. Fortunately, the duo's split follows the Lennon-McCartney model, though with microcosmic stakes. While Taylor sticks to easy-to-swallow dream pop, Fink embraces spirituality and mysticism along with more challenging songwriting. The intrepid Invisible Ones exposes Azure Ray as less than the sum of its parts, though Fink's Björk-sized ambitions constantly grapple with her colorless adult-alt tendencies. Harpsichord-laden opener ""Leave It All"" proves Fink capable of orchestration beyond guitars and processed strings. The song's languorous pace doesn't guarantee the packaged happy ending so familiar in Saddle Creek circles, not to mention Fink's spiritual gravitas: ""The god to whom I prayed/ Played a trick on me good/ Now I see his face, it's just as well/ I leave it all."" Fink parlays similar moral and spiritual conflict into several gripping ballads, tapping Flannery O'Connor Cliff's Notes and Haitian traditional music she encountered on a recent trip there. A Haitian choir accompanies Fink on the haunting ""Les Invisibles"", delivering the necessary ooh's and harmonizing for the Stygian chorus: ""We raise our hands and pray/ Les Invisibles/ We hold our heads in shame."" The song's musical twin, closing track ""Animal"", features tribal rhythms and call-and-response vocals between Fink and the choir, though she overshoots the poignancy of the trite, repeated line ""Who are you?"" Unlike these ornate compositions, Fink's sparser ballads offer a starker and more realized perspective of the album's heavy leitmotif. Fink prudently lays down playful yet somber piano melodies, hedging her own apocalyptic countenance in the process. Glum narrative ""Invisible Ones Guard the Gate"", for example, gets away with lines like ""Prophets, pimps, angels, whores/ There ain't no devil, there ain't no lord"" because of its strangely jaunty piano line and blasé relationship with the dejected accompanying instruments. Sadly, subtle tidbits like this are about the closest Fink comes to liveliness. ""Bloodline"" is a one-and-done rocker that's too dolled up and self-aware as a single to really grab anyone. The gauche string arrangement on ""Blind Asylum"" hints at a sense of humor, but can only do so much in two minutes to counteract an album's worth of doom. However, Fink's sepulchral fixation isn't inherently damning. Sufjan Stevens, for one, has proved a topic like original sin can actually propel one's music to unprecedented levels. Unlike Stevens, though, Fink hints at optimism solely through her lyrics, with little redemption musically. If you're striving to restore faith in a world of ""prophets, pimps, angels"" and ""whores,"" you gotta do better than Sarah McLachlan melodies and a rented Haitian choir.","Azure Ray co-leader makes her Saddle Creek debut as a solo artist.

Bushido Karaoke,Mayday,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ed69fc7814a47cd773/1:1/w_160/ab4d0dd0.jpg,2005-08-30 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5163-bushido-karaoke/,Saddle Creek,"Most of what we've heard from Mayday has been lugubrious indie-Americana-- not terrible, but sluggish and monochromatic to the point of anonymity. Their Saddle Creek debut at least had voluminous Mogis production to breathe in some reluctant life, sounding like chopped and screwed Bright Eyes, but its Bar/None follow-up, I Know Your Troubles Been Long, had no such saving grace. Wisely, Mayday have returned to Saddle Creek for their third and finest LP, Bushido Karaoke, and mixing duties are split between A.J. Mogis and the equally deft Andy LeMaster. But the album's overall success can't be hung upon the recording alone. Trading in his former syrupy drizzle for a more varied, gothic take on American mythology, Stevens' songwriting has become much livelier and grittier; at its best, it channels the theatrical noir of Nick Cave. The piano-rock shuffle ""Pelf Help"" is the first indication that Stevens has been immersing in the classic Sun Records catalog, although its crunchy guitars align it more with American Music Club. Stevens has attained better command of his limited vocal range, inflecting richly within it instead of pushing against it: ""We had more fun when we were poor."" Romanticizing poverty is questionable, but no one likes a parvenu, and there's resonance in lines like ""You may look dashing now/ But I remember when you were beautiful."" ""Booze & Pills"" is another straightforward '50s rocker, swinging instead of shuffling; an addiction ballad with jaunty, nauseated brass. And standout track ""Standing in Line at the Gates of Hell"" is pure Starvations melodrama, bitter and desperately seething, with its funerary chords and howled vocals. A vivid seediness rushes through it, climaxing with the declaration: ""I'm the new barkeep at the Tavern of Lost Souls!"" File under purgatory, Sisyphus, overstated fun. The record is fleshed out by songs more in the ""old Mayday"" style-- see the honky tonk twang of ""Continental Grift"", the ontological ruminations of ""Hidden Leaves"", and ""Rock and Roll Can't Save Your Life"", which is musically slight yet lyrically deft (""But it just might save tonight"")-- and a variety of covers and tributes. INXS's ""Old World New World"" is recast as a sort of panoramic bluegrass (maybe Stevens is going to try out for Rockstar?), and Gilliam Welch's ""I'm Not Afraid to Die"" as up-tempo rockabilly. ""Burned my Hands"" is a woozy, forgettable slow-burner borrowed from Neva Dinova's Jake Bellows, and ""Dave D. Blues (How to Make it Sting Like a Career)"" trades Stevens' measured lines for Dondero's more rambling style. Mayday always sounded comfortable tilling their well-worn ruts, maybe too comfortable. On Bushido Karaoke, they've discovered a way out-- passion, humor, and a touch of deviltry.","After recording with Bar/None, the gothic Americana band returns to Saddle Creek for its third album.

Daikaiju,Daikaiju,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbe5e6ef95969322ca7/1:1/w_160/0938b048.jpg,2005-08-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2622-daikaiju/,Reptile,"Somewhere along the line, surf music ceased to have anything to do with actual surfing and migrated to kitsch. Dick Dale had ""Pipeline"", the Surfaris had ""Wipe-Out!"", and Man...or Astroman? had...""You Can't Get Good Riblets in Space"". But although shuddering tremolo bars fit the image of a guy in floral print trunks, the music is mostly instrumental and as such essentially abstract, so you can make it mean anything you want it to. Even early surf rockers like the Ventures and the Tornados realized this and began to incorporate the astronautical, lounge, and kitsch elements that color most efforts in the genre these days. So the term ""surf"" as it relates to music today basically just refers to music with lots of reverb and crazy guitar playing, which is fine-- you can acknowledge the roots without trying to turn them into branches. I can say pretty categorically that Croatia's Bambi Molesters are the best surf band in the world today, but given Man...or Astroman?'s long silence, Daikaiju certainly have a claim to the #2 spot. Much like fellow modern surf-rockers Los Straightjackets, the men of Daikaiju keep their identities secret, each represented by a mask in the band's press releases, which also feature a lot of fake Japanese-to-English translations like ""Kabuki men deliver most high rocket impact!"" Students of Godzilla, Mothra, and Gamera know that Daikaiju is Japanese for ""giant monster,"" and the Huntsville, Ala., quartet are obviously enamored with the most conspicuous aspects of Japanese popular culture, though they refrain from sticking soundclips from Mechagodzilla sequels all over their albums the way so many other surf groups recently have. They instead opt to let the music speak for itself, and when it does, it's impressive, to say the least. Though their sound is closer to Man...or Astroman? than anything else (it's of course possible that there are members of that band hiding out in their ranks) there's a certain degree of prog muscle behind all that reverbed shredding. Surf is one of those funny genres where a fan basically knows what to expect and enjoyment comes from hearing it done really well, and Daikaiju delivers on that score, but there is one monumental surprise lurking in this mix in the form of album closer ""Farewell to Monster Island"". At almost nine minutes long it's nearly four times longer than the average surf instrumental and in place of the manic snare and ride cymbal of a surf beat, the band rides a skanking dub riddim, marrying two genres that in retrospect were born to love each other. The e-bowed interlude is something to hear, but even more impressive is the simple fact that the guitarists hiding behind these masks have a jazz-like sense of how to phrase a solo. The song is the kind of jam that bands just don't do any more, and it sort of makes me wish more would. So in the end, Daikaiju is an impressive full-length debut for a band that's clearly got more up its sleeve than a few Trashmen 45s and tablature print-outs for ""Rabble Rouser"". The thing with the masks and stage names like Secret Asian Man and Brain Conflict is frankly little more than a distracting sideshow to the main event, which is of course the band's massive wave of prime surf. Grab your board.","Huntsville, Ala., quartet play a modern, raucous take on surf rock.

The Last Beautiful Day,New Buffalo,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b986eb335119a49ec7d2/1:1/w_160/83f5673b.jpg,2005-08-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5919-the-last-beautiful-day/,Arts & CraftsArts & Crafts,"When I heard New Buffalo was signed to Arts & Crafts, I sharpened my repertoire of trusty Canadian jokes, drooling at the opportunity to once again tackle the Great Indie Wilderness Up North with my razor wit. But alas, it was all for naught, as it turns out New Buffalo hails from another British Commonwealth, the one that used to be a prison island. So while my hockey, snow, and fox-trapping jibes are put back into storage, I am caught unprepared to make childish, snide comments about Australia. Despite their different origins, New Buffalo doesn't sound out of place among the maple-leaf-heavy stable of Arts & Crafts. Like much of the label's populace, New Buffalo sounds like a franchise of the Broken Social Scene conglomerate, and, given the three dozen or so people in that flagship outfit, for all I know main protagonist Sally Seltmann has contributed to their communal noise. Even if she hasn't, the songs on The Last Beautiful Day have the same sort of dreamy-indie qualities Broken Social Scene has built their empire upon, an aesthetic that sounds like a glossary of the last 20 years of indie rock. Seltmann concentrates largely on the mellow side of this history, as much of the album puts me in mind of BSS' starry, ephemeral ""Anthem for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"". There's also a bit of a Cat Power thing happening here, with Seltmann excelling at the same sly, breathy vocal style as Miss Stage Fright herself. But there's considerably more optimism here than Chan Marshall would ever allow herself, as well as more complex arrangements than is usually found adorning a singer-songwriter's keyboard campfire. Both of these differences can be heard to good measure on ""Recovery,"" which undercuts the sunshiney twelve-step lyrics with jittery click-rhythms and sudden horn stabs. Many of the best tracks on The Last Beautiful Day sound like Seltmann is getting bleedover from the IDM band in the studio next door, culminating in the Air-ishly psychedelic ""No Party"". This of course makes Lazy Critic Angle #1 (just above ""she's on Arts & Crafts!"") ""Sounds like an Estrogenized Postal Service!,"" but it's a not bad comparison-- just like TPS, New Buffalo's beat-tourism can lift otherwise pedestrian material (""I've Got You and You've Got Me"") yet sometimes sounds cosmetic and extraneous (""It'll Be Alright""). Most of these computer-aided experiments are frontloaded; as the album goes on, the arrangements become sparser, Seltmann's sometimes-shrill voice is higher in the mix, and many of the unique elements that marked the first half are abandoned. Fortunately, there's a last-minute save with ""On Sunday"", an eerie track built entirely from jazz samples, right down to preserving the dusty-groove crackles, that wouldn't sound that out of place on a Jan Jelinek project. So apart from the occasional relapse into singer-songwriter solo-arrangement temptation, Seltmann proves herself a forward-thinking indie-folkster, not one to shy away from technology. With a little more development, New Buffalo might even develop a sound strong enough to dispel the Candadian, Northwest Michigander, Australian stereotypes.","Postal Service-like, Arts & Crafts-debut from Melbourne singer/songwriter Sally Seltmann.

Silent Alarm Remixed,Bloc Party,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46713d1975652138cda/1:1/w_160/b5ca4245.jpg,2005-08-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1131-silent-alarm-remixed/,WichitaVice,"It's just what it sounds like: A track-by-track remix of Bloc Party's awfully solid debut, as executed by a selection of reasonably big names and reasonably reliable artists. On the other hand, it's not at all what it sounds like: It's actually really good. Surprisingly good, and surprisingly often-- good enough that I spent half of my first listen wondering if I was really going to wind up giving it a better rating than the original. Weird, right? Maybe I shouldn't act so shocked. It's just that something's gone wrong with the rhetoric around the word ""dance"" lately. Suddenly it's considered perfectly normal to say any given uptempo guitar band from north of the English Channel is some kind of ""dance"" group, something that just isn't true according to anything but mid-sixties standards. (""Hey look, it's popular dance combo the Dave Clarke Five!"") Bloc Party may have a pretty good rhythm section, but that doesn't exactly make them Masters at Work, does it? But wouldn't you expect the fashion of the day to dictate that their occasional hustles get remixed and extended out into a series of faux bangers, something to throw on when the club's mysteriously overrun with indie kids and you need a cheap way to get them on the floor? And here's the trick: The best of these remixes don't even dream of that. The best of these remixes use beats as not much more than a grid around which to reorganize the raw sounds of the original tracks-- a frame around which to tweak the sound of Bloc Party into something a little more fractured and abstract. It's Sheriff Whitey's mix of ""Helicopter"" that seals the deal. Instead of the sound of Bloc Party lushed up and given groove, we get the sound of some alternate-world Bloc Party, one that's more interested in rocking spare and spindly, like Wire, than their usual habits of scripting professional-sounding twists and turns. When I reviewed Silent Alarm, I said that being a good ol' unchallenging rock band was this group's biggest strength; for the length of this mix, it sounds like they've traded in a little of the ""ol'"" and the ""unchallenging."" For a few stretches of tracks, it's a best-case scenario: all of the hot performances and satisfying hooks without the slight aftertaste of plain-old-band boredom. So it's really only a lull in the middle that keeps it from topping the original, and even that gets redeemed fairly quickly. A surprisingly-limp Erol Alkan mix gets followed up by what might be the best thing here: Dave P. and Adam Sparkles making a sunny 80s number out of ""This Modern Love"", complete with handclaps and some synths at the end that leave the whole thing feeling like the Cure jamming out on ""Just Like Heaven"". (Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs leaves ""Compliments"" sounding like a whole other Cure, actually.) It's the same trick again-- it sounds like something some bizarro version of the group might actually play, if they'd just chill out for a second and stop trying to be so damned grand. Others try to isolate just that grandness. Ladytron push the vocals from ""Like Eating Glass"" way back into the ether, behind a tense, unchanging thrum, for an effect that's like walking out of your apartment and thinking you can hear Bloc Party playing a festival six blocks over. (Black Strobe's typically grim-as-hell floor-crushing mix of this song might have been more exciting, but we have a theme to work here.) M83, a group whose formula is as easy to predict (and as hard to fake) as Boards of Canada's, wrap the vocals from ""The Pioneers"" around a long sweep of synths and strings. ""Luno"" gets drawn furthest from the original aesthetic, thanks to Death from Above 1979 laying in a big buzzy heap of their own hard-rock scuzz. Closest to the expected rock-gone-dance template is DFA associate Phones' old remix of ""Banquet"", which works just like it's supposed to (i.e., wouldn't mix so strangely with ""You Spin Me Round""); closest to the pop-gone-remix template is Four Tet's chimes-to-drones take on ""So Here We Are"", more M83 than M83, and smack in that Superpitcher-remixes-Postal-Service sweet spot. Surprise: It's all a good fit with the sound of the original. It's Bloc Party's old-fashioned ""every track a single"" aesthetic that makes this project possible; it's their hyper-ambitious ""Technicolour"" recording and ultra-precise performances that give the remixers so much sharp material to work with. After a few months with the original, you could start to feel like Kele Okerere was trying a little too hard to fill his vocals with non-stop passion, but here it's a boon-- grab any snippet of singing and it's ready to isolate, ready to wail. So the band makes a rock-solid professional-sounding pop/rock record, and here come some folks with their computers to make it a bit more formally interesting as well: not a bad deal at all, right?","Bloc Party's debut is deconstructed by Four Tet, M83, DFA79, Ladytron, Erol Alkan, Mogwai, and Phones, among others.

Early 21st Century Blues,Cowboy Junkies,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68b9d034d5c69bf3572/1:1/w_160/f0590736.jpg,2005-08-29 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1642-early-21st-century-blues/,Latent,"Cowboy Junkies formed 20 years ago; this is their 10th proper album, in addition to a number of live recordings and odds-and-ends collections. They amassed this much material without a break, steadily releasing records and touring since the still-great The Trinity Sessions put them on the map in 1988. The band also retains a solid base of fans devoted to its distinctive countrified folk-pop. Early 21st Century Blues-- released on the band's own label-- is a concept album, the subject matter of which you can probably guess from the peace sign painting on the cover. At the start of the year the band members met to discuss ideas for songs that addressed current political issues-- war, violence, greed, and so on. Over a few days they recorded nine covers and two Michael Timmons originals. Cowboy Junkies have always been skilled at absorbing the songs of others into their aesthetic, and for the most part this album flows like a collection of originals written to a theme. This is the record's biggest plus, the way Cowboy Junkies still evoke a convincing mood of deliberate contemplation. The flawless diction of singer Margo Timmins keeps the lyrics in the foreground, each line clear and plain as the spare, subtle musical backing. The band's long stream of Bruce Springsteen covers continues with ""Brothers Under the Bridge"" and ""You're Missing"", both of which sound great in this environment. At their best, they can help you find new things in old songs. Turns out Bob Dylan's ""License to Kill"" from Infidels actually has a gorgeous melody wrapped around the cryptic and evocative lyrics. Still, although there will always be certain comfort in Margo Timmins' voice, her limitations are frustrating. She can certainly deliver a song and make you hear the craft that went into its creation, but she never really inhabits one. She's never done abandon and has always preferred being a conduit for a songwriter to imparting her own personality. So the more familiar the song is, or the more the arrangement and production is pushed to the background, the less interesting the track becomes. Contrast Cowboy Junkies' plodding take here on George Harrison's ""Isn't It a Pity"" with Galaxie 500's untethered cover from On Fire. When we hear U2's ""One"" we can appreciate the song's mighty chords but never feel that sense of elevation. And then there's the cover of ""I Don't Want to Be a Solider"", which augments John Lennon's verses with fresh new rhymes from guest rapper Rebel. It's not as bad as ""guest rap on a Cowboy Junkies album"" would lead you to believe, but it's a misstep from a band that's done a surprisingly good job avoiding them.","Veteran folk-pop band's latest studio album is an anti-war record that features nine covers and two Michael Timmons originals.

Freedom and Weep,Waco Brothers,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b313d19756521398e8/1:1/w_160/851cb265.jpg,2005-08-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8553-freedom-and-weep/,Bloodshot,"As the grim smirk of its title implies, Freedom and Weep finds Jon Langford and the Waco Brothers-- now rather unbelievably 10 years and seven albums into the game-- in a cranky, dispirited frame of mind. Though outwardly the group's foursquare, whiskey-soaked country-rock remains as wry and ornery as ever, on many of these tracks a distinctive air of bitter, spiteful resignation has crept in, leaving the album with a depressive, hungover pallor around its gills. And while by this point one could never question the Brothers' zealous devotion to their cause, nor their unimpeachable talents as a riotous live act, one can't help but wish that their righteous anger more frequently translated itself into similarly fiery, unrestrained abandon in the recording studio. For their first album since 2002's New Deal, the Waco Bros. have scaled back on their twang slightly-- and on the vestiges of actual punk almost completely-- and have now cozily settled into a tempered Crazy Horse/Skynyrd mid-range classicism. Early in the group's career the Wacos were often perceived as merely another of Jon Langford's numerous side projects away from the Mekons-- and rather a play-acting novelty at that. But they've long since matured into a true, fully democratic band, and here Langford splits microphone time with guitarist Deano as well as mandolinist Tracy Dear. Performances are stout if generally uneventful throughout, and often it's the tasteful pedal steel contributions of Mark Durante (formerly of Revolting Cocks and KMFDM) and the relentless pummel of drummer Steve Goulding (who's played with everyone from Graham Parker and Elvis Costello to Archer Prewitt) that rescue these tracks from their most hidebound roadhouse tendencies. ""What if our history means nothing at all?"" worries Deano on the opening blue-collar lament ""Nothing At All"", a Son Voltish scorcher that immediately (if unsurprisingly) reestablishes the Wacos' alignment with the woebegotton, put-upon underdog. This can't-win-for-losing stance leads the band quite naturally to the election night blues of ""The Rest of the World"", (""Champagne's still on ice/ Might as well down it tonight/ It ain't going to last four more years/ Nor are your rights,"") as well as to Langford's exquisitely vindictive Bush diatribe ""Chosen One"". On the well-titled ""Drinkin' & Cheatin' and Death"", Langford returns another of his favorite barn-sized targets-- commercial Nashville country. Over the album's best woozy hook he drops the newsflash ""Country radio lost its balls/ And started selling fantasy/ No drinking, no killing and the only divorce is from reality,"" tidily bringing up-to-date those listeners who've been comatose or otherwise out-of-pocket for the past couple decades. Elsewhere, the Brothers direct barbs at reality TV (""Fantasy""), crass materialism (""Lincoln Town Car""), and Intelligent Design (""Missing Link"") with varying degrees of wit and subtlety, but unfortunately the band's staunch musical conservatism ensures that none of these tracks ever ventures far from the predictable. Freedom and Weep culminates with the raucous, misery-loves-company anthem ""Join the Club"", an appropriately cheerless finale for what's arguably the Waco Brothers' most accomplished but least fun album to date.","Seventh album from Jon Langford's country-rock band has less twang than its predecessors and almost no trace of punk.

London Stone,The Bevis Frond,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29813d19756521388e7/1:1/w_160/1156dd1e.jpg,2005-08-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/686-london-stone/,WoronzowWoronzow,"Nick Saloman was once a second-hand record dealer. Over a prodigious musical career (nearly 20 albums so far), the long-haired Englishman known as the Bevis Frond has likewise dealt in dusted-off, literate psychedelia, even earning a spot on Rhino's Children of Nuggets box. Recording mostly solo on vintage equipment, Saloman alternates between squealing hippie jams, fuzzed-out indie-pop and stately, pastoral folk. His voice is wounded, elegant and scrupulously unaffected. London Stone, the latest Rubric reissue in Saloman's series of turn-of-the-90s lo-fi neopsych primers, was intended as the follow-up to 1991 magnum opus New River Head, but the band's U.S. label chief took a pass, leaving the album without distribution here-- until now. As any veteran vinyl hunter knows, the story should end with London Stone (plus bonus traxx!) triumphantly taking its place as the Frond's lost masterpiece. After an unaccompanied, traditional fiddle piece by guest Barry Dransfield, the record certainly gets off to an impressive start with ""Coming Round"". The album's best and poppiest tune builds into dueling jesusfuck guitar solos, both played by Saloman 'course, and sees this Mascis-like dinosaur admitting, ""I come from a different age."" ""That Same Morning"" can stand proudly beside to contemporaries like Teenage Fanclub with its jingle-jangle acoustic guitars. Live favorite ""Well Out of It"" knocks out teeth with chunky grunge riffage; ""Still Trying"" is an uptempo Farfisa-ish organ stomper that easily bests most of the recent garage-rock revivalists. ""Lord of Nothing"" sticks out pleasantly enough as a slightly twee British folk song in the mold of Richard Thompson. A few tracks too often, however, Saloman winds up adding too little to the gems in his evidently formidable LP collection. In the liner notes, he admits to waxing ""Hendrixiano"" on ""Living Soul"", which blisters and bluesters somewhere between ""Purple Haze"" and ""Crosstown Traffic"", but that doesn't make it memorable. Title track ""London Stone"" opens with the many-times familiar, distortion-laden chords of ""All Along the Watchtower"", then closes with another Dransfield fiddle solo-- which will come as an unwanted dorm-room flashback for anyone who went collegiate during the Dave Matthews regime. But don't ask me to explain why ""A Most Singular Hole"" (""There's a hole in my life and I fill it up with doubt"") is better than a well-shroomed jam band with the right pedals; it's not. It speaks well for Saloman that even in 2005, when many of his original selling points have supposedly become uncool-- authenticity, virtuosity, faith in the redemptive power of rock and/or roll-- that so many of his songs still thrill in their own right. The bonus tracks, too, are always at least passable, from an illuminating demo version of ""Coming Round"" to an arguably superior version of the album's ""And Now She's Gone"", plus unreleased tunes (of which acoustic, haunting ""Scavenger"" is the most worthwhile). Completists who own the original will want to seek out the reissued London Stone for these. Alas, good luck finding it on vinyl.","The latest Rubric reissue in Nick Saloman's series of turn-of-the-90s lo-fi neopsych primers.

Road to Rouen,Supergrass,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e013d197565213906a/1:1/w_160/2dc73180.jpg,2005-08-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7627-road-to-rouen/,EMI,"Nothing makes you feel older than a band whose career you've followed almost from the start releasing a greatest hits album, but that's what Supergrass did last year. Bands that get old tend to get all ""mature,"" and the last thing a band like Supergrass needs is maturity-- their best songs thrive on youthful energy and a naive appropriation of influences you didn't know could be mixed together. So I was hoping for a mid-life crisis on Road to Rouen, the band's fifth album. The terrible pun in the title is a good start, but they're still mellowing, settling into their success and putting their swagger in a less visible place. They're good enough songwriters that they can survive slowing down a bit, but there's no question that this is Supergrass' least-exciting album yet. Granted Road to Rouen does have a fistful of killer moments during its brief under-40 runtime. You get the swamp-rocking title track and its companion ""Kick in the Teeth"", which together make up the album's late-energy burst. ""Road to Rouen"" is stuffed with nasty descending riffs and volume pedal swells to back up Gaz Coombes' blue-eyed soul croon. On an album that resides mostly in slower tempos, it becomes clear just what a great singer Coombes is: He has a rich, nuanced voice that sounds great shouting or navigating a delicate melodic phrase. ""St. Petersburg"" is something of an underwhelming lead single, a mid-tempo shuffle on which everything from the piano to the vocal is merely workmanly; the most interesting thing in the song is its stretchy string arrangement, which twists and pulls like taffy. It doesn't seem like something that would make the Supergrass Is 20 compilation in 2014. More likely candidates include album opener ""Tales of Endurance (parts 4, 5 & 6)"", a song that plays a lot like something from the band's self-titled third album, with a lengthy intro of acoustic strumming, piano. and echoing slide guitar. Trumpets and strings break in to announce the groove and the band slinks through a darkly funky verse, finally exploding after a second orchestral interlude into a big, stomping chorus with shades of ""What Went Wrong (In Your Head?)"". Unfortunately, Supergrass doesn't really ever harness any of the momentum they create on individual songs to make a truly great LP, throwing away the peak they reach on the epic, six-and-a-half-minute power ballad ""Roxy"" on a meaningless, jokey interlude called ""Coffee in the Pot"". There's a lot to love here, and Supergrass is still a killer band when they get in their groove, but there's definitely a noticeable lack of the hunger that once dripped from their music, no sneer to bring it all crashing home. Road to Rouen will get its spins in my house, but I'm crossing my fingers for the mid-life crisis next time out.","Fifth album from the former junior Britpoppers sees them continuing to settle into middle age.

Plans,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8dec0084474cd0c0f1b/1:1/w_160/c9d788bd.jpg,2005-08-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2233-plans/,Atlantic,"Death Cab for Cutie once released an EP called Stability, the irony being that it was one of their few releases that branches away from their core sound. That's fine, to a point. Their stately, melodic indie pop gives them a big enough palette with which to paint albums that don't lose their flavor on the bedpost overnight, but it also means that their records can feel interchangeable. On Plans, the band's fifth album, Death Cab made the jump from the friendly confines of Barsuk Records to the storied halls of Atlantic, a move that makes a lot of sense. The band is ready for the large, diverse audience a major can provide, and they make the transition seamlessly, in large part due to the underrated production of guitarist Chris Walla, who has a way of making even the weirder flourishes (and the band tries a few to mixed success here) feel totally natural. Despite Walla's consistently cozy production, Ben Gibbard's lyrics continue to move from critiques of middle-class life to tackling Big Themes, here the relationship between death and love. On ""What Sarah Said"" he claims, ""Love is watching someone die."" On ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"" it's the title sentiment, and on ""Soul Meets Body"" he says, ""If the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too."" ""I Will Follow You..."" is the album's quiet centerpiece, just Gibbard on acoustic guitar, his fragile, almost falsetto tenor, simple delivery, and unexpected turns of phrase turning an well-worn lyrical road, the fear of losing a lover, into something affecting. The way he personalizes the afterlife and draws in childhood Catholic school experiences is impressive, to say the least. All this and it's sequenced directly after the album's most musically ambitious track, ""Different Names for the Same Thing"", an overly melodramatic track that heads off on a ponderous, M83-aping electronic odyssey. The band's other, better experiment is lead single ""Soul Meets Body"", a sleek pop track that excels except for when the drums drop dead, the textures get all smooshy, and Gibbard goes up the scale to sing the title-- it's such a weird blunder that it's hard to tell at first if it derails the song or just nudges it a bit. Several listens in, the song works on the strength of its catchy ""ba da ba da ba ba"" passages and the incredible verse melody, but that one little passage is awkward, like the song has something stuck in its teeth. Death Cab opens the album strongly with ""Marching Bands of Manhattan"", a song that feels like it's constantly in the process of taking off, with pensive drumming and big, sweeping vocals singing about sorrow seeping into your heart as if through a pin-hole. For its peaks, the album also has its share of valleys, like ""Summer Skin"", notable mostly for its nifty bassline, and ""Your Heart Is an Empty Room"", a song that never breaks out of its musical holding pattern. The band suffers from the infliction: Death Cab still sounds basically the same as ever in the post-""O.C."" world. In a way, it's comforting to know what you're getting: Four or five songs you'll treasure, four or five you'll tolerate, and a pretty good band sticking to their guns. In another sense, it would be nice if a band reaching for a larger audience had a sound that matched that sense of ambition.","After four Barsuk albums of often stately, melodic indie pop, Death Cab for Cutie become the first of the ""O.C.""-boosted indie bands to make the leap to the majors.

The Moon Is a Dead World,Gospel,by: Austin Gaines,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c022eb335119a49ed340/1:1/w_160/6754d5f1.jpg,2005-08-28 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3681-the-moon-is-a-dead-world/,Level Plane,"Let's face it: Prog has never been cool. Your first guitar teacher, the one with the Yes shirt, was not cool. The kid I knew who worshipped Neil Peart, and had a license plate that read ""DRUMGUY"" was not cool. And no matter how much you may love Genesis, that won't erase the fact that Peter Gabriel eventually left Phil Collins in charge. On the other hand, Gospel are cool. Cool enough to get approval from the white-studded belt, sideways trucker hat, back pocket bandana crowd, and the unadorned (and girlfriendless) music geek crowd. What makes Gospel so cool? It could be the patchwork of functional King Crimson via Converge riffs, sprayed out drum work that's reminiscent of Damon Che of Don Caballero fame at his drunkest, and Dazzling Killmen-esque guttural yells. Then again, it could just be that the band sprawls out on a nice medium ground between math-rock and technical hardcore/metal. It's not a crowded genre as the years have shown that heavy bands with prog influences end up becoming black metal, Dream Theater, Ruins, or a brutal prog era Weasel Walter project. It's a good thing Gospel have an entertaining drummer: His corrugated beats are the highest item in the mix. We're actually allowed some prominently displayed keyboard work as well, which is abnormal for a non dancepunk album that's fit to be sold at Hot Topic. But how do you get the kids with scene hair to listen to mutant prog? Just make all the tracks hover around the five-minute mark. Cautious? Of course. But the nine-minute ""A Golden Dawn"" proves why this works-- it's by far the poorest song on The Moon. It fails to shimmer and ends up sounding like an outtake from a Trail of Dead practice. Gospel use the tools of the trade to fix the problems attention deficit listeners (hardcore kids) had with prog. The spiraling arms of the guitar lines and the splotchy drums of ""Yr Electric Surge is Sweet"" bridge the gap between the rage of hardcore and the extensive rehearsal of prog. ""And Redemption Fills the Emptiest of Hearts"" evens manages to inject a perverted version of the most standard of hardcore gimmicks, the breakdown. Sure, they disguise it a little, but not enough to displease the ears of Norma Jean kids, and then they move straight into King Crimson-inspired keyboard and synthed guitar interplay. They even go so far as to make Tool palatable to the underground with the Middle Eastern guitar lines and echoing soundscaped instrumentation of ""Opium"". (I was digging Gospel until they made me reference Tool and lose what little cred I had as a music reviewer.) Tricking the kids would be shameless if I didn't wallow in Gospel's message. Granted, they're displaying their influences a mite too visibly. Gospel strip down their influences to compensate for many of their favorite band's substituting polish for violent energy. Maybe Gospel are cool because they are smart enough to meld prog with today's updated hardcore. But knowing today's hardcore scene, maybe Gospel are just cool because Kurt Ballou of Converge recorded their album and Converge make some of the hippest hoodies on the market.","Prog-esque band finds a middle ground between math-rock and technical hardcore/metal.

Year of Meteors,Laura Veirs,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9949d034d5c69bf3c96/1:1/w_160/3d8c6a48.jpg,2005-08-28 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8525-year-of-meteors/,Nonesuch,"It's no criticism to say that Laura Veirs's new album, Year of Meteors, will sound familiar to listeners, newcomers and old fans alike. Her voice recalls Liz Phair without the accusations, and like Patti Smith, she comes off like a poet first and a singer second, although with a much more MFA-friendly style and without the rock-priestess performance. Her songs indulge flights of verbal fancy, like Ben Gibbard but less unctuous. And Veirs is routinely compared to Suzanne Vega for the dryness of her delivery and to Beth Orton for the way she melds folk rock with dance sonics. There is, however, the vague sense on Year of Meteors that she is trying to distinguish herself from these comparisons and even from her previous album, last year's Carbon Glaciers, a breakthrough in Europe and a cult favorite in America. Leaving behind that release's barebones sound, Veirs recorded Year of Meteors with her touring band, the Tortured Souls, which includes bassist Karl Blau, keyboard player Steve Moore, and percussionist/producer Tucker Martine. The result is a fuller sound that, for better or worse, is less like the work of a solitary musician and more like a collaborative effort. These essentially spare songs have been dressed up with full-band arrangements and treatments that employ glittery electronic effects intended both to offset the organic acoustics and to set Veirs apart from every other female with a guitar. Often these additions work well within the songs: the band propels ""Secret Someones"" and ""Rialto"" with pop-song momentum, and Eyvind Kang's strings on ""Fire Snakes"" and ""Parisian Dream"" perfectly compliment Veirs's dreamy lyrics. But often, as on ""Galaxies"" and ""Through the Glow"", these treatments sound entirely superfluous, diluting the potent simplicity of Veirs's understated performance. Besides, Veirs needs no further distinction: despite the justifiable comparisons with artists past and present, she has developed a musical style that is maybe not groundbreaking, but is at least highly personal and distinctively expressive. Lyrically, her songs make abstractions concrete and conjure eerie images and strange associations, some of which belie her background as a geology student. The standout ""Spelunking"" develops an elaborate metaphor that connects subterranean exploration with romantic commitment: ""If I took you, darling/ to the caverns of my heart/ would you light the lamp, dear?"" she asks, before describing the denizens of the darkness-- ""fish without eyes, bats with their heads/hanging down towards the ground."" Veirs confronts everyday subjects with the same imaginativeness and eye for detail: on ""Secret Someones"" she addresses the loneliness of touring: ""O a smile would melt me to an asphalt strip,"" she sings before asking in the bridge, ""tell me, did you make it to the show?"" Lyrics reproduced outside of their songs can often sound flat or pretentious, and the words above desperately need Veirs's intonations to achieve their full effect; merely typing them or reading them won't do. For all the decorousness of her music and songs, it's her voice-- usually charmingly flat, precisely overenunciating, and gently assertive-- that conveys the deepest sense of wonder and truly sells these songs. Veirs really doesn't need much in the way of accompaniment: the primary components of her music are voice and guitar. If Year of Meteors feels a little too busy and overworked, so what? Veirs is maybe the gazillionth iteration of the quiet voice and plucked guitar, but she serves as a potent reminder how variable and compelling that combination can be.","Sufjan Stevens' touring mate indulges in flights of verbal fancy on her latest folk-pop LP.

Bright Ideas,Portastatic,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f7c0084474cd0bfcd4/1:1/w_160/db9517e4.jpg,2005-08-28 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6420-bright-ideas/,Merge,"In one sense, Mac McCaughan's repetitions are a key to his longevity. Structurally, he makes excellent use of run-on sentences for exclamatory emphasis; doubled lines (or more often quadrupled hiccups) propel his best songs. The oldie ""My Noise"" jumps with a row of fluctuating ""It""'s: ""It rides beside me/ It has no choice/ It's my life/ It is my voice/ It is stupid/ It is my noise."" This sort of stutter pops up time and again in McCaughan's back catalogue, and judging from Bright Ideas, the sixth Portastatic full-length in 13 years, he wisely avoids a Mouldian aim at mid-career eclecticism, and continues the practice. The title track's opening lines hinge on their reps: McCaughan adopts an airy Elliott Smith, stuck awhile in clusters of ""I thought""'s so multitudinous they'd take up too much space for me to quote. Here, as is often the Portastatic case, the point isn't rock catharsis. Superchunk remains that predominant space for songs that make you bounce on your bed, with Portastatic more about introspection. ""Bright Ideas"" fits that low-key template perfectly, the protagonist resting his head on a pillow rather than using it as a soft weapon at a high-spirited slumber party. McCaughan shakes things up a bit (but just a bit) the rest of the way. In indie rock years, McCaughan's approximately 100. Between Merge, which he operates with Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance and various high and low-profile musical projects the North Carolina icon's rarely out of sight. How does a centurion maintain musical vitality? One approach is to get Conor Oberst to pen your overstated press release. The more valiant option: experiment tastefully and within your limitations. Doing just that on Bright Ideas, McCaughan plays Portastatic for the first time with a full band. Sure, past offerings have included guest spots by Sleater-Kinney's Janet Weiss and Tony Crow of Lambchop, but this is McCaughan's most realized rock affair. As one would expect with the fuller instrumentation, Bright Ideas is McCaughan's most Superchunk-friendly Portastatic collection. Though with Portastatic dispatches arriving at more regular intervals than rockers from those slack motherfuckers, the difference feels more like semantics than anything else. Unexpectedly, the album features a flurry of decently energized fist-pumpers-- ""Through With People"", ""The Soft Rewind"", and standout ""White Waves"". Each is enjoyable in its way. When McCaughan grows too chill (""Truckstop Cassettes""), tiptoes into country (""Little Fern""), or lulls a la mid-tempo Neil Diamond/Crooked Fingers (much of ""I Wanna Know Girls"" ), he drops his raw nasal register, losing what makes his work compelling. Bright Ideas is more pleasant than kick-ass or inspired. But for an album this deep into his career, at a time when he could start growing aesthetically antsy, McCaughan sticks to a blueprint that works best: He shifts things enough to let us know he's still breathing, avoiding the desperate genre-jumping that often afflicts musicians of a certain age.","Superchunk leader and Merge co-owner Mac McCaughan unveils the sixth album from his introspective side project.

I'd Like to See You Again / Live 1980,A Certain Ratio,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c713d19756521386ec/1:1/w_160/4ab43020.jpg,2005-08-28 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11657-id-like-to-see-you-again-live-1980/,Factory Benelux,"It's been weird to see people try to puff up A Certain Ratio in the last few years, to make them more than they ever were during their lifetime. On the one hand, it's just a side effect of post-punk necrophilia; at some point, on or around August 2003, any remaining good (just good!) post-punk bands had finally been exhumed, renovated, rehabilitated, whatever. That's two years now of chasing up the lesser lights, dodgy one-shots, side-projects and general jerk-offery. C'mon-- those Brazilian p-punk comps are bad Cure demos with a tropical frosting. Yes, I know the Early comp came out in March 2002. Let's just say ACR was ahead of the crap curve. The facts remain: Simon Topping still sounds like Ian Curtis Cliff's Notes. The purported funkiness will still not be backing up any asses. Their name is just more lamentable Factory Nazi-chic. And there's very little ACR did that someone (Joy Division, the Cure, Liquid Liquid, Funkadelic, your mom) didn't do better. This is not to say they didn't have their charms. The double EP that contained ""Do The Du"", ""The Fox"", their (overrated but still pretty funny) cover of ""Shack Up"", and ""Flight"" is good fun if you enjoy mooning with the blinds closed to twitchy approximations of forward momentum. (And hey, sometimes, who doesn't?) But when they started fucking with jazz, Latin, electro, disco-- check, pleez. This is not some sort of inverse pop-snobbery talking. This is a purely functionalist argument. By 1982, the disco tradition was just that: a tradition, one where all-night, non-stop dancing was the rule of law. Plenty of other cultures had been fucking with this for years, and it showed up in things like northern soul. Even when they tried to bodyrock, ACR were still hampered by their stiffness and leftover gloom. (Let's not even get into the inherent racism in the fallback ""but they had a black guy drumming for them!"" argument. Rhythm != drumming.) I'd Like To See You Again was a swiftly recorded follow up to Sextet (the only ACR release of note after the early singles and half of The Graveyard and the Ballroom and even that's pushing its essentialness). Martha Tilson's proto-trip-hop vocals on Sextet were at least pleasing to the ear, if still essentially ballast, but here they're gone. So the band goes for longer grooves, more instrumental passages, and fewer vocals. I'd call it smart if the music were better. ""Touch"" acknowledges the new pop that ruled '82, but refuses to deal with it head on. ""Showcase"" has slap bass (slap bass). They throw party whistles and P-Funk backup chants on ""Saturn"", and fair play, they're at least trying to have fun. But Martin Moscrop's trumpet, once the source of an amusing kind of fake electric-Miles fog (one thing they had that JD didn't), just sounds anodyne here. If you listen closely you can hear the beige Howard Jones records they would soon be making. A year later, of course, New Order released one of the biggest 12"" singles in history, tore up NYC clubs like the Funhouse, and permanently shook the Joy Division out of their hair. They even got to retain a slight creatures-of-the-night aftertaste that ACR were desperately distancing themselves from. All in all, ACR must have been pretty pissed off. Live 1980 was from a show recorded after their fateful trip to the U.S., where they recorded their debut album, To Each, with Martin Hannett (which means it sounds exactly how you think it sounds) and had their wigs flipped by the hustle and bustle of early 80s NYC. And it shows, with a sound that has the tension between their sketchy raincoat beginnings and the good foot already breaking down. They're already straining to breath some of that American air, to suck up that mythical fonk, to banish the sooty taint of their homelands. Which pretty well killed them as a band. To make matters worse they avoid their hits in favor of album tracks, and then decide to do realt-time extended remixes, with lotsa percussion. The reissue includes two bonus tracks. If that excites you, check your pulse. All this is not to say I didn't enjoy parts, sometimes even large parts, of both records. But I can't imagine ever listening to them again. The problem with reissue culture, like real archaeology, is that eventually you're just hitting dirt. Sometimes an arrowhead is just a rock, you know? We all have finite time on this planet; do you want to listen to fake Funkadelic or the real thing? Ready your angry emails and dismissive blog posts if you must, but just think about it the next time your survey your gigs of mp3s, stacks of CD-R's, or mounds of .99 vinyl. How are you using your time?","Factory also-rans continue to get the reissue treatment.

Late Registration,Kanye West,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa8db1335d7bf16996b1/1:1/w_160/fab12909.jpg,2005-08-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8768-late-registration/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"""Can I talk my shit again?"" Contrary to popular opinion, hubris does have a righteous appeal. Those who claim Kanye West's antics hinder his work are missing the point. His self-importance is obvious, but the arrogance that comes pre-packaged with his insecurity is what makes West the most interesting hip-hop figure of the past five years. That's the reason he landed on ""Oprah"" and the cover of Time Magazine last week, rather than 50 Cent or Nelly or Slug. It's not sales; it's souls. That said, at the end of the day, it's his ear, a golden instrument, and his adventurous collaborative spirit that have made him the most fully formed artist of his genre. The sprawling Late Registration is the year's most accomplished rap album, and in turn, he's done something that his heroes-- the Pharcyde and Nas, and father figure Jay-Z-- couldn't do: deliver on a promise the second time around. With the help of co-producer Jon Brion, West has taken his jumbled personae, buoyant enthusiasm, and vision for the grandiose, and transformed his chattering, seemingly unrealistic ideas into an expansive, imperfect masterpiece. Without Brion, this album probably sounds a lot like its predecessor, The College Dropout-- full of tough horns, jacked soul, and flashes of brilliance. What the former Fiona Apple maestro brings to the proceedings, aside from a conductor's wand and a smile, is the ability to inflate and infuse West's ideas with even more life. A case in point is ""Hey Mama"", a track that leaked more than a year ago. The song is traditionally purty, dominated by handclaps and a flittering sample of Donal Leace's ""Today Won't Come Again""; basically a trad-Kanye production. The Brion redux inserts a moaning vocoder, tin pan alley drums, a xylophone solo, and cascading synth coda, all without mucking up the heart in the middle. Flashes like this surround the sometimes urbane, often cheeky West with a new resonance. Where would ""Crack Music"", a blustery martial stomp, be without its soaring choir and biblically extended outro? Probably somewhere on the Game's album. Could Kanye have single-handedly fused the showboating old school boom bap of ""We Major"" with its build-it-up and watch it all fall down production without Brion or co-producer Waryn Campbell? Not likely. By opening the studio to admired colleagues, he's allowed himself room to think even bigger than the multi-tracked ""Jesus Walks"". On the mic, West sounds sharper and more battle-tested, though he'll never have the effortless insouciance of Jigga or teeth-gritting religiosity of Nas. To his credit and detriment he continues to surround himself with superior MCs like Common (on the sober ""My Way Home""), impressive newcomer Lupe Fiasco (Just Blaze's life-affirming ""Touch the Sky""), and the ineffable Cam'Ron, who continues his magical run with savant-like witticisms on ""Gone"". Even Houston's Paul Wall manages to fit ""illuminate,"" ""insinuate,"" and ""caterpillar"" into 16 bizarre bars on the woozy ""Drive Slow"". All this to go along with curious shouts from two conflicted giants, Jay and Nas, who hang like specters over the album. Unlike the ""great"" hip-hop releases of yore, the productions here are so insistent that even a charismatic voice like West's can become an afterthought. Only ""Roses"" delivers the endearing sentimentality of ""Jesus Walks"" or ""Family Business"". ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)"" offers some admirable if dubious political grandstanding, but as with every colossal undertaking, you gotta pay the cost to be the boss. The album's worst track, ""Bring Me Down"", overwhelms with silly orchestral pomp, courtesy of Brion. It also presumes that anyone still cares about Brandy, who sounds like she's recording her voice through a Cuisinart. ""Celebration"", too, is a busy, empty exercise in, well, celebrating. Barring those two tracks, and a few innocuous if unnecessary skits about a fraternity for the financially impaired called Broke Phi Broke, the rest is aces. ""Addiction"" is unsophisticated in concept but inspired in delivery. ""Gold Digger"" is also simple but not subtle, tearing into the realm of the obvious with a Ray Charles-aping Jamie Foxx and recycled drums, but succeeding with humor and reverence. Opener ""Heard 'Em Say"" might be the most bandied about joint here, thanks to the presence of Maroon 5's Adam Levine, but guess what? He sounds great. Off-key and blue-eyed selling his soul, but like nearly every risk here, the syrupy pop works. ""We all self-conscious"" has not taken on a new meaning post-Dropout. Conjecture about West revolutionizing the sound of modern hip-hop is mostly a fallacy. Not much has changed, though a few Brion hacks might appear to offer someone like Cassidy an oboe loop or two. In general, what makes West's sound and personality so vital is that it is completely singular. The maddening contradiction, the goofball ridiculousness, and the furious fist-raising still comprise an original voice. Though you'll notice I hesitate to use the phrase ""everyman"" to describe West. Not every man could have written a headphones album that'll rattle your trunk. ","The producer-rapper follows his Pazz and Jop-winning debut The College Dropout with a collaboration with Jon Brion; together they transform West's chattering, seemingly unrealistic ideas into an expansive, imperfect masterpiece.

Holiday Machine EP,Bottom of the Hudson,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a430c0084474cd0c0431/1:1/w_160/af153e90.gif,2005-08-25 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1077-holiday-machine-ep/,Absolutely Kosher,"Bottom of the Hudson is mostly the work of one man, Eli Simon, with assistance from regular collaborators. Previous BOTH albums were collections of bedroom demos and older material; their first EP for Absolutely Kosher, Holiday Machine stays loyal to the 8-track. It's less diverse than The Omaha Record, and if you were a fan of 90s indie rock, it's probably nothing you haven't heard before-- some of Guided By Voices' scrappy production, a dash of Pavement's ennui, and some Archers of Loaf-brand scruff. The album opens with its title track-- deep, detached vocals floating above swaying rhythms and chugging guitars, It's a pleasant stroll down ""120 Minutes"" lane, but things pick up with the second track, ""Riot Act"". Jangly guitars hold court over strummed power chords, pulled along by the double-tracked vocals of Simon on a simple, reaching melody. These songs are deceptively basic with a hint of melancholy. Guided By Voices seems an apt comparison, with ""One of Us"" aiming for the same target as subdued GBV gems like ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" or ""I Am a Scientist."" I'm not saying it's just as affecting, but BOTH wrench surprising gravity out of its few slow chords and simple hook, ""But you're not/ One of us."" The way Simon phrases it, cut between the ""not"" and ""one"" and sung in flat tone that doesn't pine or sneer, makes getting ostracized sound like inevitable fact, as commonplace as a high school gym line in order of ascending height. The remaining tracks hew even closer to Alien Lanes-era GBV, particularly the roughshod electric drum beat under the jangle of ""Conjecture Measure"", or the thin power chords, strange accents, and non sequitur lyrics of the effortlessly catchy ""Candyman"". The melodies aren't as instantly memorable as ""Riot Act"" or ""One of Us"", but there's not a hint of filler, and more than half of the tracks have me hitting repeat before this brief EP ends. Tracing over the lines of classic slacker bands is an easy way to sound unaffected, yet I don't hear any ulterior motives in their nostalgia, just simple, self-assured songs from a band that never grew out of the 90s. Put it this way: Talent isn't flashing how much better you do something, it's making what you do better look easy.","Scrappy production meets indie ennui on the latest release from Eli Simon and co.

In the Remote Woods EP,Foreign Born,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bebceb335119a49ed0e1/1:1/w_160/a2577c6c.jpg,2005-08-25 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3347-in-the-remote-woods-ep/,StarTime,"Difficult to pigeonhole yet instantly recognizable, Los Angeles-based Foreign Born vexes indie taxonomists like hardcore porn does Supreme Court justices, leaving critics to play the Potter Stewart ""I know it when I see it"" card rather than enumerate the requisites. In the Remote Woods is too fidgety for shoegazer, too upbeat for dour post-punk, and too varied for indie pop. Nevertheless, Foreign Born evoke all the familiar touchstones, stitching together Slowdive and the Stone Roses with newer benchmarks the Walkmen and Arcade Fire while carving their own niche alongside those artists. Armed with bassist/producer and singer/composer tandem Lewis Pesacov and Matt Popieluch, these guys shrewdly cram every inch of the EP with lush keyboards and strings, complementing Popieluch's taut, reverb-soaked melodies. Yet Garrett Ray's aggressive drumming and driving tempos prevent this from being Souvlaki, not to mention Popieluch's penchant for Bono-like theatrics. Opening track ""The Entryway"" shows off the group's repertoire, beginning with a gritty goth bassline flanked by spotless synths and ringing guitar. From the first uttered lyrics, Popieluch steadily crescendos, nearly blowing out his vocal chords before a guitar solo brings the song home. The EP's middle tracks follow the precedent set by ex-Star Time behemoths the Walkmen. Standout ""It Grew on You"" cops the Walkmen's searing guitar strumming and cataclysmic drum fills while Popieluch haphazardly slurs his lyrics a la Hamilton Leithauser. He's no clone though, just Leithauser's spirit bottled up inside a deeper, smoother croon. Dragging its feet on listless chords, ""Exactly on the Verge"", though lacking in quirky, carnival playfulness, would fit nicely among Bows + Arrows nostalgic ballads, ending dolefully on the phrase ""I was never so, so young."" By the end of the record, the group runs low on ideas, and songs grow splotchy as a result. ""Exactly on the Verge"" both moves and drains as it structurally pales in comparison to its more complicated proceeding tracks. Closer ""Remote Woods"" starts with a primitive, fist-pumping riff pilfered from ""I Will Follow"", but a mediocre verse leads only to a deflated chorus, and the repeated intro riff serves solely to resuscitate the song midway through. At final count though, Foreign Born's tallies three shining nuggets and two intriguing yet fatigued tracks taken out of the oven too soon. It's a sterling debut from a well-bred band only one caffeine fix away from a solid, potent full-length.","L.A. band stitches together elements of shoegaze, indie pop, and post-punk.

Artificial Intelligence / Artificial Intelligence II,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a850ea9e61561daa57bd/1:1/w_160/584a2983.jpg,2005-08-25 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/,WarpWarp,"Compilations like Warp's Artificial Intelligence don't come around often enough. Everything about it was gutsy. Warp had started three years earlier as a dance-oriented label that grew out of a DJ shop. Its founders had fallen in love with Detroit techno and set about releasing music that would further that tradition. But they noticed that in addition to dancing at clubs and raves, people were using electronic music in another way. The iconic cover illustration said it all: A robot, reclining in his living room, quite possibly stoned, with Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd LPs strewn about his floor. They envisioned a post-rave head session, a time for a contemplative and cerebral journey into music's future. A bit hippie, isn't it? Warp didn't care. And they didn't just suggest these things with a title and images; they laid it all out explicitly on the record's cover. ""Artificial Intelligence is electronic listening music for long journeys, quiet nights and club drowsy dawns"" and ""Artificial Intelligence is the first in a series of 'listening albums' from Warp."" These statements now sound like they would be affixed to some sort of Ultimate Chill compilation sold at a coffee shop circa 1999, but this wasn't polite, head-nodding downtempo. Most of Artificial Intelligence was just a click or two away from the music that would have filled a dance floor. Tempos were a little slower and textures were more labored over but the LP was built on techno's sturdy foundation. The idea was to retreat to a place removed from the utilitarian demands of the dance floor to engage in electronic music R&D.; Everything about the package was presented as a paradigm shift, all the way down to the disarmingly earnest answers to standard questions (""Why did you contribute to A.I.""?) supplied by the artists on the inside sleeve. In sum, Warp said ""Here is something new and original, and you are going to be hearing a lot more if it,"" and then delivered on the promise. A genre was born, but Warp's ""Electronic Listening Music"" term never caught on. Instead, we got the much-reviled ""Intelligent Dance Music,"" named after the popular e-mail list of the same name. With Warp going out on a limb to place itself at the forefront of ""progressive"" electronic music, revisiting both newly reissued volumes of Artificial Intelligence more than a decade later is in some ways problematic. You want to hear tracks as music first, but you can't help but listen to it as a historical document. I can say that nearly all of Volume I still sounds great. Richard D. James kicks things off as the Dice Man on ""Polygon Window"", and while his synths sound slightly crude by today's standards, the datedness is ultimately appealing, the weight of history adding substance in the same way as, say, heavy reverb does to countrypolitan. Autechre here is ridged and steeped in early futurist hip-hop; they contribute two great tracks including the astounding ""The Egg"", with its heavily chopped and rhythmically precise vocals. Naturally Dr. Alex Patterson brings the most archetypal ambient with the gauzy, sound-effects heavy ""Loving You Live"". I never particularly cared about Speedy J but the Dutch producer lightens the mood effectively with the bubbly and popish ""De-Orbit"" and then closes with the drifting ""Fill 3"". Relatively speaking, the second volume doesn't hold up nearly as well. Oddly, while it has more variety it also seems more generic. By 1994 there were a lot of people making ""electronic listening music"" and this doesn't feel like a particularly special assemblage of what was out there. Canned breaks ruin Link's ""Arcadian"", while a recurring sample of a woman intoning ""Feel...strange..."" throughout Mark Franklin's ""Release to the System"", unlike the Richard D. James synth textures mentioned earlier, loses meaning when plucked from its rave-era context. Tracks by Richard Kirk and Higher Intelligence Agency are pleasant and engaging techno but not particularly memorable. The peak again comes from Autechre, whose ""Chatter"" finds them fusing half-speed Cybotron-style electro with languid acid textures, the soundtrack for breakdancing ecstasy in slow motion. In the liner notes to the first volume, the Autechre boys then just 19 and 21, respond to the question ""Electronic Music. Where next?"" with an unintentionally prophetic answer. ""When people run dry copying each other, a deeper more creative music will occur where ideas and originality will play a central role."" By now they are all too aware that the well of mimicry is essentially bottomless and there may not be as many original ideas as we once thought. Listening to the first Artificial Intelligence compilation is a reminder of how nice it must have been back in 1992 to dream such a thing.","Reissues of Warp's genre-defining compilation and its 1994 sequel.

Pixel Revolt,John Vanderslice,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9185e6ef9596932135c/1:1/w_160/7ed74d66.jpg,2005-08-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8405-pixel-revolt/,Barsuk,"Don't call it a concept, but on Pixel Revolt, there are four songs directly pertaining to September 11th and what followed. ""Plymouth Rock"" tells the story about a soldier's first and possibly last sortie in Iraq, with the swooning and swirling music an impartial backdrop to this scene. ""Exodus Damage"" talks about a militiaman seeing the second plane hit, the narrator resigned to a fate beyond his control as a Radiohead-sanctioned mellotron chorus and various Middle Eastern drums circle around a repeated mocking call for ""dance dance revolution."" ""Trance Manual"" has an embedded journalist in Afghanistan seeking solace in the arms of a prostitute, and features the delicate chiming of church bells. ""Radiant With Terror"" tweaks a Robert Lowell poem about Cold War fears (""Fall 1961"") to address more clear and present dangers, and sets this paranoia to a tune that's a kissing cousin to Smashing Pumpkin's ""Disarm"". And then there are the other songs on the album. Songs about losing a girlfriend's rabbit, a detective tracking another detective in a murder investigation, a groupie infatuated with a pop star, and behavior-modifying pharmaceuticals. Superficially, there seems to be no connection between this crop of songs and the more politically aware ones. The boyfriend losing the rabbit and the wounded soldier seemingly have nothing in common, until the boyfriend of ""Angela"" uses the rabbit's escape as an excuse to talk about getting the hell out of Burbank-- ""What do we have here anyway?/ The abandoned warehouse scene.../ Synthesized, bullshit art dreams"". The detective in ""Continuation"" is caught in the same feedback loop as the gun-show goer in ""Exodus Damage"". And just as the journalist is looking to escape the noise and chaos of the war, the pop fan's looking for an oasis from the noise and chaos of his life. The verses of ""Peacocks in the Video Rain"" are cluttered with everyday debris and disjointed thoughts, but they give way to a simple four-word chorus, four words that are implied by the speaker in ""Trance Manual""-- ""I love you, too."" Like Vanderslice's last album, Pixel Revolt features a store's worth of cool noise makers, used primarily by the singer and long-time collaborator Scott Solter. Meticulous arrangements abound, with the strings done by cellist Erik Friedlander, but everything is in it's right place. To the credit of Vanderslice and Solter, the orchestral clown-car smorgasborgs to be had in ""Trance Manual"" and ""Exodus Damage"" sound just as unfussy as sparse tracks like ""Dead Pacific Slate"" and ""Farewell Transmission"". Some might wish this gift for fastidious arrangements would carry over to the lyrics, which feature a bevy of look-it-up references and descriptions that might stymie attempts at easy listening. It doesn't hurt to do a little research or, like, pay attention to lyrics worth a damn. (According to the liner notes, ""the lyrics of Pixel Revolt have been edited, expanded, and otherwise improved upon by John Darnielle"", so now you know the rest of the story.) Appropriately, the one song that falls flat on this album-- ""CRC 7173, Affectionately""-- is as straight-forward as one could hope, both on the word and music tip. It's also boring as hell (think: really bad Maroon 5), and ends the album on a sour note. Better, in my mind, to end with the solemn epiphany of ""Dead Slate Pacific""-- ""the only thing standing between/ Me and that long rope over a carpenter's beam/ Was you""-- and its gorgeous instrumental coda, ""The Golden Gate"". On an excellent album full of stories about running away and seeking safe haven, it would have been nice to end knowing someone found where they belong and, hopefully, made it through to the other side.","Meticulously arranged album is split between songs about 9/11 and those about subjects like losing a girlfriend's rabbit and detectives.

The Essential,Iron Maiden,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b45e6ef95969320250/1:1/w_160/f76c9930.jpg,2005-08-25 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4166-the-essential/,Sanctuary,"Iron Maiden's importance in the history of rock music can hardly be overstated. The band formed at a time when heavy rock music was becoming old and passé, yet despite little radio play and a refusal to bow to music business demands, they managed to sell out stadiums the world over. Bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris had a clear vision of what he wanted his band to be from the beginning: His dedication to complex songwriting, rousing, hook-laden choruses, and a powerful stage show put the band head and shoulders above their New Wave of British Heavy Metal counterparts. In fact, now, almost 30 years later, the only other band from that scene who remains relatively well-known is Def Leppard, and they sound radically different today than when they started. Perusing the Maiden discography reveals as many live and ""greatest hits"" packages as studio records. In 1996, the band released what was expected to be the definitive Maiden hits package: Best of the Beast. Since then, however, we've seen The Best of Iron Maiden, Ed Hunter, Eddie's Head, Edward the Great, and now, finally, The Essential. And this isn't even counting the live albums. So why, then, do we need another greatest hits package? I'll leave that one to the accountants. It's a discussion that belongs in the same realm as longtime fans arguing over how they could have possibly left off ""Children of the Damned"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", or ""Can I Play with Madness"". But this isn't a for-fans package; instead, The Essential is an two-disc primer on a band that has released 13 studio albums, recorded upwards of 150 songs, and spent the last 25 years defining a genre. The tracks here are arranged in reverse-chronological order, a curious choice, but ultimately a good one, forcing attention on newer tracks that may otherwise have been lost. The disc opens with ""Paschendale"" from 2003's underrated Dance of Death. An epic, classic-style Maiden track, clocking in at over eight minutes, ""Paschendale"" shows anyone who isn't familiar with the band's newer catalogue that little has changed over the years. Singer Bruce Dickinson's pipes are as crisp as ever, and the Steve Harris/Nicko McBrain rhythm section is still bombastic and powerful. From Brave New World, the disc that marked Dickinson's triumphant return to the band, we get ""The Wicker Man"" and the title track. Comeback single ""The Wicker Man"" dispelled worries that the band couldn't recapture the ferocity of its earlier work. ""Brave New World"" starts with mellow, echoed guitar and synth strings, while Dickinson croons over top, but goes on to feature out-of-nowhere time changes, winding solos, and dual- and three-guitar harmonies. From the mid-90s we get two tracks apiece from Virtual XI and The X Factor. Both albums featured vocalist Blaze Bayley-- an accomplished if not exactly original vocalist temporarily replaced Dickinson. The band could've easily found a clone and carried on, and it's to their credit that they avoided that trap, but it's hard to get over the missing Dickinson. Bayley's vocals are somewhere between Dickinson's and original mic-man Paul Di'anno. He's gruff, but he's got range, able to hold a note with the best of them. Unfortunately the songs just never seem capture the spirit of the band. Fear of the Dark (1990) and No Prayer for the Dying (1992) had some strong moments but far too much filler, and both suffered from going-through-the-motions syndrome. The four tracks featured here from those discs are just about all the casual fan needs. All four are strong, especially ""Be Quick or Be Dead"", one of the angriest songs in the band's history. And even though ""Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter"" has long been lampooned for its silliness, it's worth revisiting as a reminder that these guys aren't nearly as serious as their moody music would indicate. From 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, we get ""The Clairvoyant"" and ""The Evil that Men Do."" This was Maiden at both their biggest and their most commercially accessible. The concept album featured tons of hooks and prominently featured synthesizers, and these two tracks showcase those traits magnificently, with ""The Clairvoyant"" containing this set's most triumphant melody. Continuing backwards through their career, we arrive at Somewhere in Time, Maiden's first album to feature keyboards. ""Wasted Years"", where Dickinson worries that the his golden years are slipping by while he's trapped in a tour bus, begins with one of the most recognizable guitar leads in heavy metal. ""Heaven Can Wait"" is just as anthemic, forgoing the band's often gloomy imagery for an upbeat, positive message. The band's first three albums to feature Bruce Dickinson were released in quick succession: Barely a year separated Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind. The band spent a large chunk of 1983 and 1984 on the road, then fired back with Powerslave. All three are powerhouses, and they are laced with many of the band's most well-known songs. By Powerslave, the line-up had finally solidified, and, and the benefits of this tightness were apparent. ""2 Minutes to Midnight"", ""Aces High"", ""Flight of Icarus"", ""The Trooper"", ""Number of the Beast"", and ""Run to the Hills"" are live staples to this day. This is Maiden at its strongest, its most confident, and its most adventurous. From the band's earliest period we get ""Wrathchild"" and ""Killers"" from Killers and ""Phantom of the Opera"" from their self-titled debut. Paul Di'anno's raspy voice is a pretty stark contrast to Dickinson's, but these songs, and the albums they come from, show a younger band still trying to find its sound. ""Wrathchild"" and ""Killers"" both feature an infusion of punk attitude, and ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a an amateur attempt at prog-rock, featuring tons of time changes, odd vocal harmonies, and an instrumental breakdown in full of tinkling guitar and high-end bass. The collection closes with two live tracks: ""Running Free"" from 1985's Live After Death and ""Iron Maiden"" from the forthcoming Death on the Road. The two tracks do well to bridge the old Iron Maiden with the new. The two songs were originally recorded over 25 years ago, and hearing these versions, themselves 20 years apart, back to back gives strong evidence that these guys are just as powerful today as when they first crawled their way out of East London almost three decades ago.","2xCD primer to the kings of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.

Holes in the Valley,Nations by the River,by: Stephen M.

Their debut, Holes in the Valley, conjures visions of some lost pocket of '60s social idealism, a wigwam village where men cultivate immense beards and women nurse infants in slings and everyone gathers around the campfire for early-evening sing-alongs. This is, of course, both a compliment and a criticism. The band is obviously aiming for a throwback sound (which makes the chorus ""These are the times we live in"" seem particularly disingenuous), and the flower-power-era folk on Holes in the Valley alternates between kum-ba-ya intimacy of ""Heart Attack Romance"" and jangly pop like ""We Dance Everyday"", all with a sporadically brooding mood and dark lyrics that address complicated, but not necessarily free, love. Despite reports that Luke Steele is a control freak with his day-job band the Sleepy Jackson, the communal aspect of Nations by the River's sound creeps into the band's make-up: Steele, Gelbison's Edo Kahn and Dove Kahn, and Old Man River's Ohad Rein all share the songwriting responsibilities and alternate vocal duties, and it's not unimaginable-- hell, it's more than likely-- that they even share the less desirable tasks, like driving the tour van or playing bass. However, like any utopian experiment, Holes in the Valley gets very dull very quickly. Their devotion to re-creating a particular sound gives the album an air of deadly self-seriousness and precludes any real experimentation or fun. What else is a side-project good for if not that? A few flashes of ingenuity interrupt the otherwise mundane songs. For the album's most remarkable moment, ""The Prettiest Girl"" starts off like every other song on the album-- gentle acoustic strums, sensitive vocals-- but then what sounds like a summer-stock chorale sings a lengthy showtune segmentÉ in Hebrew. ""Heroin"" at least tries for moody atmosphere, although any song by that title that's not a Velvet Underground cover is pretty much doomed. Steele adds some weirdness in places, his prickly voice sounding even more otherworldly in this earthy context: ""Kids World"" is sleepy Sleepy Jackson, but ""Boys"" features his eerie falsetto leading into a hypnotic chorus. Nevertheless, Holes in the Valley is full of holes itself: song ideas that sound like they're still incubating. The opener ""I Don't Want You"" ends abruptly after only one verse and chorus. Most of the songs are built on repetition of simple passages, and a few, like ""Cracking Up"", hum their melodies where lyrics are conspicuously absent. The effect is to suggest something impromptu and fleeting, temporary instead of stable. Apparently, all things must pass.

Nice and Nicely Done,The Spinto Band,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6be9d034d5c69bf35f4/1:1/w_160/1928ddfb.jpg,2005-08-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7829-nice-and-nicely-done/,Bar/None,"You'll probably never read about a Wilmington, Del., ""scene."" No Philly-style ""Next Borough"" New York Times puff pieces, either. Why, I'll bet you didn't even realize that the home of many major credit-card issuers is the birthplace of Tom Verlaine and to-the-bone bad-ass George Thorogood. On aptly named Bar/None debut Nice and Nicely Done, local sextet the Spinto Band takes advantage of its hometown's invisible indie profile to sprawl all across the map of twitchy, 64-crayon guitar-pop. To start, the Spinto Band's two lead singers traverse enough styles for a week's worth of positive Pitchfork notices. Nick Krill does the wobbly David Byrne warble about as well as deservedly lauded Clap Your Hands Say ""It Boy"" Alec Ounsworth. See harpsichord-splashed breakup song ""Did I Tell You"" and Turtles-quoting synth-pop come-on ""Spy Vs. Spy"". But Krill can also do dead-on Brighten the Corners-era Steve-O Malkmus (""Late"", which brightly details the everyday dangers of rushing home for a favorite show: ""It's slippery by the pool""). Meanwhile, fellow songwriter Thomas Hughes covers the sotto-voce sensitive-guy territory. His kazoo-enhanced ""Brown Boxes"" zooms in on a move-out/breakup: packing a pointless Hummel figurine while half-wishing for box-cutters sharp enough to ""end it all"". As throughout the album, a buoyant chorus saves the day. Indeed, the group's college-age members rarely fail to build on their obvious indie influences with swooning California melodies and quirky instrumentation. Of particular note is Krill's ""Oh Mandy"", a ringing anthem of unrequited love, lush with mandolins and theremin. It namedrops the WB-- hey, ""Dawson's Creek"" was filmed in Wilmington...N.C.-- but is probably perfect for ""The O.C."" (that's meant as a compliment, guys). Another standout is ""Trust Vs. Mistrust"", which rides glockenspiel and a catchy ""ah-ooh, ah-ooh"" hook into another Pavement-esque verse about young, well-mannered lust. Four-on-the-floor ""Crack the Whip"" lashes the make-up alternapop zeitgeist, whippin' the Killers at their own neu-dance-wave game before ascending to a gates-of-heaven Beach Boys chorus like this was the Biblical, non-DFA Rapture. Yeah, so the occasionally adolescent lyrics admit the Spinto Band's youth and the last couple of tracks trail off a bit, but the group's spirit of pop adventurism suggests it's worthy of early comparisons to gifted labelmate Architecture in Helsinki. Extra kudos are in order for goofy bonus track ""Japan Is an Island"": Amid Atari bleeping, Wilmington's finest will take you to a land where ""Cornelius is a pop star,"" but they won't take American Express. Actually, they probably will.","Deleware sextet creates twitchy, 64-crayon guitar-pop.

Pine Cone Temples,Thuja,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a9ea9e61561daa562c/1:1/w_160/a1ef3636.gif,2005-08-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8053-pine-cone-temples/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"As the flagship act of the prolific Jewelled Antler Collective, San Francisco-based quartet Thuja's recorded output-- four official albums and at least as many homemade CD-Rs released since 2000-- should be considered generous by any reasonable measure. Little were we to realize, then, that the group has in fact been holding out on us, as evidenced by their substantial new double-album Pine Cone Temples. Assembled from previously unreleased tracks recorded between 1999-2004, this collection again finds Thuja returning to their always captivating (if increasingly familiar) studies in pure environmental immersion and improvised, keenly observant micro-folk. Performed, as always, by Jewelled Antler linchpins Loren Chasse (also of the Blithe Sons & Id Battery, among others), Steven R. Smith (solo, Hala Strana), Rob Reger (Franciscan Hobbies), and Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards, Blithe Sons, etc.), Pine Cone Temples differs from its predecessors most notably in terms of scope. Where earlier albums like Ghost Plants and Suns consisted predominantly of shorter pieces of widely varying tones and textures, here Thuja works almost exclusively on larger scale compositions, with most of these eight untitled tracks extending beyond the 10-minute mark as the group patiently allow their meticulous, spontaneous music to spread vine-like beneath the forest canopies, quietly chewing vast expanses of scenery with their soft mandibles. As with their previous works, Thuja have recorded these pieces in a variety of natural settings, using strategically placed contact mics to help integrate the tiniest audible details of their ambient surroundings into the group's gentle commotion. Theirs is a uniquely intuitive, egoless species of improvisation, as the musicians seem to be competing not for the listener's attention, but to see who can most thoroughly camouflage himself in the underbrush. Though the quartet implements such conventional ingredients as guitar, piano, and hammered or bowed strings, the album contains few unaltered or immediately recognizable sounds, particularly since each musician seems determined to disguise his instrument as a conch shell or an acorn. The first disc of Pine Cone Temples opens with the brief, jarring sound of a needle scratching across vinyl, before Thuja unhurriedly settle into their first extended creation, an effervescent mosaic of rustling percussion, deep earthy drones, and twinkling lights. From then on, the events spread over the course of these two discs seldom achieve anything beyond the volume of a fallen branch crashing to earth, as the group variously content themselves with gradually building swells of transistor rubble, amp feedback, and imprecisely Eastern-sounding acoustic strings. A notable exception occurs late in the second disc's epic 26-minute finale, a piece that climbs from its tranquil intro of what sounds like a campfire dispassionately consuming manzanita to an apex of electrified noise as starkly dissonant as anything the group have ever cut. With its ambitious dimensions and the uncertain chronology of its compiled recordings, Pine Cone Temples seems an especially diffuse addition to Thuja's discography, one whose primary appeal will be to those already familiar with the group's organic methods and contours, while newcomers are wisely directed to start with the more easily-digested likes of Ghost Plants. And as with any cross-sectional collection like this, one can't help but wonder if Thuja isn't sitting on a virtually bottomless pile of such recordings, full of tapes that could equal or better anything included here.","Latest from the flagship act of the prolific Jewelled Antler Collective.

Geography Cones,Get Him Eat Him,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c021c0084474cd0c3144/1:1/w_160/6a248671.jpg,2005-08-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3680-geography-cones/,Absolutely Kosher,"If you've followed Matt LeMay's reviews on Pitchfork, you know that he likes the indie rock. Now the indie rock's liking him back: Absolutely Kosher's seen fit to release his band Get Him Eat Him's full-length debut. Tuneful, guitar-driven rock? Check. Earnest, reedy vocals? Check. Sloppy playing and slacker vibes? Ch- actually, no, uncheck. Get Him Eat Him largely forgoes the happy (or apathetic) accident and the facile discordant smear, trafficking in deeply layered guitar lines you need a map to follow, processed vocals, and intricately sculpted melodies. Like all good indie rock, it vortexes a bundle of touchstones into a nervous, jittery coil-- you can hear proggy Built to Spillisms jostling against the hyper jangle of the Wrens, and a virtuosic Ted Leo shouting ""power-pop!"" to a snotty Elvis Costello's ""new wave!"" The geography cone is a snail armed with a fatal nerve toxin (thanks, Google!) that the National Institute of General Medical Sciences equates with ""eating a lethal dose of badly prepared Japanese puffer fish while a cobra is biting you."" Get Him Eat Him was shrewd in taking its name for their album-- these songs are sheer nervy overload, biting and stinging from every direction. ""The Celebration"" opens abruptly in mid guitar rumble, as if the eager band had been playing it for eons, just waiting for someone to roll tape. ""One Word"" is a standout, with a gliding lead and swift counterpoint staggering into an anthemic, off-kilter swagger, the music swinging in and out of phase with the catchy vocal line and its ""haircuts and halos."" The harmonizer effect LeMay often uses on his vocals sweetens up the squealing, staccato ""Pardon My French"", and imbues the already-overdriven ""Bad Thoughts"" with even more evil robot power. The pageantry is so non-stop that the plosive, almost IDM-ish serenity of ""Interlude"" is doubly pleasing, as are the pastoral jangles, frictionless bass balloons, and lyrical keyboards of ""Early Scarlet Globes"". In fact, I'd like to hear more from Get Him Eat Him in this more pensive, less busy range. Jay Pellici's recording amplifies every spasm of pent-up energy roiling in these songs, and the young band's enthusiasm (LeMay is the oldest at, what, 21? 22?) is palpable, electric. A flurry of ideas and passions so hotly burning that they have to be captured right now vie for space, occasionally weighing the record down, but usually flogging it toward whatever blurry finish line college kids are chasing these days. I don't know; I'm aging out of the demographic. Smells like fumbling sex and drunken dance parties to me, the burnt-ozone aroma of youthful urgency at odds with the preternaturally deft, confident musicianship.","Conflict of interest alert!

Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light,Bell Orchestre,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49613d1975652138d41/1:1/w_160/df4c9557.jpg,2005-08-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1174-recording-a-tape-the-colour-of-the-light/,Rough Trade,"Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light is everything instrumental post-rock should be and nothing it shouldn't: it sounds live but hardly loud and is brimming with sound but uncrowded. Renouncing formulaic bombast, Bell Orchestre dazzles by finesse, not force. Call it blank slate music-- oceans of negative space awaiting colonization-by-imagination. Bell Orchestre, led by the Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry, sparks memories of critically maligned early-decade instrumentalists Ghosts & Vodka and Telegraph Melts-- bands derided, in part, for their lack of distortion. Bell Orchestre is more frictional than the former, less NPR-arty than the latter, but its general drift is similar. From the stertorous, semi-electronic horn swells of prelude ""Recording a Tunnel (the Horns Play Underneath the Canal)"", the album worms into focus. Less like rain than a slowly gathering fog, ""Les Lumieres Pt. 1"" builds from a murmur to a klaxon. To follow its development is to watch bacteria conquer a petri dish: New threads twist off somewhat chaotically from the brass nucleus-- an awakening string trill here, a gingerly bell flourish there. On ""Les Lumieres Pt. 2"" the ecosystem hits full flower. Sultry, echoing horns chafe against skittish strings and fast, charging beats, a textural contrast reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. (The bands, as Recording demonstrates, also share a penchant for ungainly titling.) But Bell Orchestre are on a much happier tip. Where Godspeed ride an abandoned train through a miserable wasteland, Bell Orchestre gallops across rich, rustic landscapes. Like Lumen or Explosions in the Sky, it's all a bit fantastical, but the band goes easy on the symbolistic dalliances. Bell Orchestre is all about freeing our neural pathways, not directing them. And hey, here's an idea: concision. Five of Recording's 11 tracks undershoot four minutes. Despite a couple of longer, jammier pieces the album is a still a breezy listen. That's because, unlike lost siblings Do Make Say Think, Bell Orchestre largely avoids ambient pussyfooting. Voluminosity and slenderness rarely cohabitate in instrumental post-rock, but here both are integral. Nuggets ""Recording a Tunnel"" and the chilly ""The Bells Play the Band"", which imagines Boards of Canada piped through ham radio, would become boundless gorges of nothingness in the hands of many similar bands; Bell Orchestre wisely consigns its most shapeless passages to short stopgaps and segues. Meanwhile, instrumentally verbose songs like ""Throw It on a Fire"" are kept asteer by bedrock percussion. Recording is designed to underwhelm. It rewards repeat listens and nurtures those lulled by its intoxicating spumes. Whether the album achieves its titular synesthesia is debatable, but Bell Orchestre tap into a wide, mesmerizing range of the spectrum.","Arcade Fire side project does instrumental post-rock the right way: brimming with sound but uncrowded and dazzling with finesse rather than force.

The Loving Sound of Static,Mobius Band,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36269fc7814a47cd62c/1:1/w_160/ca23bbe4.jpg,2005-08-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5343-the-loving-sound-of-static/,Ghostly,"Most bands would be better served by ditching the whole 45-minute album thing and focusing on a steady stream of concise 20-minute EPs. Furthermore, considering their miniscule front-to-back odds, all double albums should be steamrolled at once. Think about it: When the Olympics sweep through every couple years, everyone gets amped for the 100-meter sprint while longer foot races inevitably devolve into mind-numbing NASCAR-like tedium-fests. Though there may be some kind of impotent hand-me-down stigma associated with such shorter musical statements-- ""It's good...but, I mean, it's only an EP""-- it's about time those disgusting discriminations changed. The Mobius Band, for one, would benefit from such a less-is-more mentality. Following four increasingly focused EPs that saw the band go from quaint instrumental post-rock to this year's blip-rocking hybrid City vs Country, the Brooklyn-based trio disappoints here by retracing the alienated posture of their previous release while rarely reaching its respectable heights. Predictably, the first thing to wear is frontman Ben Sterling's monotone musings. Whether his pulse simply sustains at an abnormally low level or he's putting us on with his reedy, Ben Stein-type delivery (sans dead-pan wit, game-show acumen, and conservative agenda), the affectless style is limiting. The vocals become even more troublesome when coupled with some of the record's offensively inane lyrics-- hipster-histrionics can only get you so far, guys. On City vs Country, the band's words were harmlessly and somewhat mysteriously vague, but here the content dips into rote Bushy bitching on modern-day corruption with ""Twilight"" (""I will teach my children to lie/ They will know what's wrong will be right""), rote indie vs. mainstream bitching on ""Radio Coup"" (""Publicists tell you what to think/ They do a good job""-- of course, the Mobius Band are hardly flack free), and inexcusable-- and rote-- repetitiveness on ""Philadelphia"" (""Ain't it funny how times can change/ Arrangements re-arrange""). The trio's words are remnicent of enduring heartthrob-misfit Jordan Catalano's uncanny appeal-- they're more believably brooding and tortured when expressed in detatched generalities rather than forced specifics. And instead of glossing over such uninspired wordplay with their dynamic newfound studio polish (Interpol associate Peter Katis helped produce the album), the mistakes are highlighted by an overdose of tepid electro-zzzz ballads. Revamped oldie ""Taxicab"" lasts nearly six minutes and is punctuated by a relatively raucous finale, but the bulk of the song is about as riveting as its drawn-out hook: ""Taxicab, taxicab, middle of winter."" Another patience-tester is ""Philadelphia"", which is drowned in an atmospheric listlessness that only accentuates the obvious undercooking. Static isn't a total between-stations affair. On the strength of an enticing synth line, ""Doo Wop"" is the closest this band may ever get to quirky, hip-shaking. The half-man, half-machine blues of ""You're Wrong"" recalls Radiohead's ""I Might Be Wrong"" as it gives us a glimpse of what the Mobius Band's high expectations could have wrought with more structural massaging. And the perfectionist production is exquisite and exhausting in its attention to detail and nimble attempts at combining typical guitar jangle with zippy, bionic beats. There's a decent EP buried within the album's 10 songs but, as a whole, Static doesn't have the stamina to uphold its over-extended play.","Following four increasingly impressive EPs, the Brooklyn-based trio retraces the alienated posture of their previous release.

Between EP,Vetiver,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9989d034d5c69bf3c9c/1:1/w_160/be6c8c34.jpg,2005-08-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8529-between-ep/,Dicristina,"Vetiver was chosen to lead off Devendra Banhart's Golden Apples of the Sun compilation, the modern folk equivalent of landing a single on Top of the Pops. But its song, ""Angel's Share"", was summarily blown from ken by Joanna Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons""-- by many accounts the national anthem of freak-folk. On the LP front, the quartet came up short, too: Its eponymous debut trumped products from Cocorosie, White Magic, and Josephine Foster, but lost publicity to critical darlings Espers and Iron & Wine. Having Banhart on guitar wasn't the boon you'd expect either: Judging by reactions to late-year solo bid Nino Rojo, the gangly dynamo couldn't escape the shadow of his own Rejoicing in the Hands, much less curry favor for Andy Cabic and co. A year later, the freak-folk radicals are trying a softened stance. Six Organs' School of the Flower, a spindly psych jamboree, may cling with both hands to weird '04, but forthcoming releases from Banhart and Animal Collective come lathered and rinsed. Between finds Vetiver, once conservative by comparison, in perfect consonance with the gang-- and the band hardly had to change a thing. Brevity is Between's greatest asset: With no standout tracks, the five-song EP is best swallowed whole for a quick, mild sedative. Cabic's elegiac vox are also a strong selling point; they sound pressed on to the mix, flushed with a ferric patina. But Cabic needs an assertive hook to step up to meet him. Instead, his backup-- mainly an acoustic guitar and quiet percussion-- pitter-patters along, serviceable but indifferent. Fat with reverbed guitars and wafting fiddle, ""Belles"" has by far the richest instrumental backdrop. Don't expect variegation, but it sure is pleasant. ""Been So Long"" dips into Wonder Years schmaltz and comes up with the album's sweetest vocal hook, while ""Save Me a Place"" is all starry campfire strum. ""Busted (Brokedown Version)"" takes it a step further, imagining the curdling marshmallow on a stick. It's almost atavistic-- those warped, sylvan coos sound so 2004. So here Vetiver releases this satisfactory summer holdover while freak-folk takes a well-deserved snooze. When it awakes, it's Banhart, AC, and Cocorosie with new albums, on which hang more-or-less Sisyphean expectations. Maybe that'll clear the air for Vetiver's next LP, and it'll be Andy Cabic's turn to shine.","Second-tier freak-folkers issue five-song EP.

Menos el Oso,Minus the Bear,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c559eb335119a49ed9b2/1:1/w_160/bff01869.jpg,2005-08-23 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5326-menos-el-oso/,Suicide Squeeze,"In music, potential can be a slippery concept. Less tenable in a Seattle retro-rock quartet than, say, a 6'4"" prep school pitcher with a great fastball, potential causes both critics and fans to recklessly affix phrases ""shows promise"" and ""nice raw instincts"" to lackluster debuts, hoping these consolation prizes will come to fruition or at least become self-fulfilling prophecies. For Seattle quintet Minus the Bear, the potential on 2001's This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic EP has been the sole sustenance in a career marked by unfledged EPs and a fallow full-length. While Menos el Oso falls short of watershed magnitude, the album showcases Minus the Bear's spaz-prog mishmash subtly solidifying into something potent. Minus the Bear's instrumental prowess has always been a double-edged sword: Although their signature jittery riffs and hyperactive song structures initially reel listeners in, singer Jake Snider can't hold a candle to his bandmates, forcing them to sacrifice complex compositions for Jimmy Eat World-style power-pop choruses. However, Snider and his mates strike a compromise on Menos el Oso, allowing the instruments to carry an increased share of the melody while the singer's dry vocals take a backseat. Opener (and possible west-coast shout-out) ""The Game Needed Me"" deploys jerky percussion, vulcanized bass, and spring-loaded guitar swells to complement Snider's smooth, detached Pedro the Lion imitation. The reduced airtime makes room for more rhythmic and technical noodling, and on ""Memphis and 53rd"", this conservative vocals approach produces one of the band's most commendable, and downright pretty, mid-tempo efforts. The song opens with a reverb-heavy riff reminiscent of Sunny Day Real Estate, building steadily towards a jazzy albeit anxiety-ridden chorus until Snider wisely heeds to the best riff on the album-- a spacey, lithe little maneuver that makes the album's finger-spraining licks seem even more gratuitous. Unfortunately, there just aren't enough interesting ideas here to conceal Snider's limitations. ""The Fix"" and ""Fulfill the Dream"" each storm out the gate like Q and Not U rockers, but the vocals drag behind, eventually necessitating a masturbatory guitar solo to finish off both tracks. Menos el Oso ultimately stumbles on its own self-conscious maturity. Yes, the outlandishly long song titles and sophomoric lyrics have mostly vanished, but ""El Torrente"" and ""The Pig War"" don't need to take cues from sopor-groups Karate or Death Cab for Cutie. Still, whether or not Minus the Bear ever fulfill their once prodigious expectations is irrelevant at this point. They ain't exactly blue chip prospects anymore, but I can settle for a solid, developed role player.","Seattle retro-rock quartet showcase their spaz-prog mishmash.

Here/there Dino Felipe and Nick Forte may come off a Black Dice cover band (""Gnome On the Noggin""), or Fennesz worshippers with mostly good intentions (""One Needle Per Village""), or a chopped-and-screwed version of Hair Police (""Hoof Lager or Horse Pills""). But when it comes down to it, F+F swing harder than all them-- shit, they swing period. Jazz (but not free jazz) purists in the indie rock midst, the kind who approach things from an ""Is this jazz?"" perspective like they teach you at college radio: Check the processed vocal riff on ""Pick Yer Poison"", which sounds like Louis Armstrong trying to drown himself in a bathtub. Yep, he just doesn't have the heart to go through with it. Hey: Maybe jazz greats unsuccessfully committing suicide isn't what Shaggy Black is really about. Maybe this is a disco record. Maybe that's why the buzzy pitter-patter of ""Anteater"" sounds like the Bee Gees being electrocuted by the state for serial murder. Maybe that's why ""Violent Flag"" has such a violent, tribal call-to-war vibe, a most poetically roundabout paean to ""Disco Duck"", whose radio jock composer Rick Dees is still living, I repeat, still living. The blanks are yours to madlib, and you might as well: My gripe with Shaggy at first was never a paucity of syntax or front-end beauty (this record is gorgeous), just no context. But the flip of context-lack is complete malleability, and really, this record's refusal of one proper ""carefully considered processed noise"" read might be the only reason worth giving a shit about it.

Love Kraft,Super Furry Animals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ce13d1975652139042/1:1/w_160/9467f233.jpg,2005-08-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7605-love-kraft/,XLBeggars,"In the Super Furry Animals' world, each note, each word contains multitudes of meanings. So frontman Gruff Rhys's pre-SFA band name Ffa Coffi Pawb can mean either ""Everybody's Coffee Beans"" or ""Fuck Off, Everybody."" So 2003's ""Venus & Serena"" refers to the tennis sisters and/or two pet turtles beloved of a boy raised by wolves (sure, why not?). The recordings are pop, psychedelic, IDM, punk, funk, folk, soul, classical-- often all at once. ""Citizens Band"", a hidden track from the band's 1999 album Guerrilla required a liner-note glossary to decode its playful lyrics, as Rhys sang: ""So many ways to communicate what you want to say."" Love Kraft, then, the Welsh quintet's seventh album in 12 years, may be an homage to the bands Love and Kraftwerk. It may signal the band's love for its craft, or acknowledge the eternal sense/sensibility, passion/prose, Speakerboxx/The Love Below dichotomy. Is it an expression of affinity for ""master of the macabre"" H.P. Lovecraft, whose novels sometimes took place in an SFA-OK ""Dreamlands"" setting and are familiar to Re-Animator fans? If you believe Rhys' press clippings, it's either a sex shop in Cardiff, Wales, or a ""hovering vehicle""-- a fitting replacement for the band's Radiator-era ""peace tank."" Heck, maybe Rhys just really digs cheese. Whatever its etymology, Love Kraft is a utopian epic, a sweeping musical argument for love in the time of Fallujah. In that sense, it's vintage SFA, with even its departures underscoring the band's long-established strengths. The leftist politics are less overt, but just as potent; the compositions more focused, but still mad as a Lewis Carroll hatter; the pop more rockin', yet probably more accessible to noobs. The splash that begins the album is at once a baptism and an immersion, and the band doesn't come up for air until High Llama Sean O'Hagan's final flitting string arrangement. Politically, fury has given way to fantasy. Gone are direct polemics like antiwar parable ""The Piccolo Snare"" or Bush-burner ""Out of Control"", both from 2003's Phantom Power. With the world ""slipping away""-- ""Kiss me with apocalypse,"" Rhys mourns on opener ""Zoom!""-- the Furries throw up their hands and invent a new one, full of dinosaurs, chickens, horsenappings, unwanted pregnancies, and, yes, love. The intergalactic Prince workout of lead single ""Lazer Beam"" proposes ""no more romantic comedies"" (take notes, Dems!) and a weapon to wash away evil-- as practical, when you think about it, as convincing certain voters they were misled into a downward-spiraling war. On ""Frequency"", Rhys' target is clear (""You say history will be your judge/ But the jury's whipped, gagged, and drugged""), but a sumptuous ""Turning Tide""-style hook dilutes the venom. The songs are at once lovely and full of impotent dread; if you can't beat 'em, they seem to decide, beautify. For the first time, four of the band's five members sing and contribute songs-- including keyboardist Cian Ciárán, ostensibly the force behind the band's past trackier, IDM-influenced efforts-- and together they grasp the narrative arcs that sometimes have eluded Rhys. The tripartite ""Cloudberries"", with its ""Took a circle of friends to the village square/ Oh, love triangles"" and samba-like midsection, ranks among the band's finest. Ciárán's ""Walk You Home"" starts as shy, string-laden Avalanches lounge before swelling into a delicate payoff. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan's ""Atomik Lust"" leads languid ""Feel Flows"" keyboards unwittingly into a radioactive wall of guitars; ""I'd love to see the ending someday of Citizen Kane,"" Ieuan sighs. Guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford's Wings-esque road tune ""Back on a Roll"" is the lone disappointment. ""Lazer Beam"" aside, the guitar-heavy Love Kraft may be the Furries' most straightforward ""rock"" album. Even as ""Psyclone!"" riffs on space invaders and tyrannosaurs, it boasts the most enormous na-na-na-na chorus this year-- Beck's ""E-Pro"" swathed in Moroccan samples and brazen strings. ""Ohio Heat"" steps from Phantom Power's Byrdsian twang to an America-esque trot, with harmonies and acoustic guitars spooning sugar onto lyrics involving a fictitious Welsh emigrant's 19th-century Midwestern suicide. Bunf's ""The Horn"" must be among the catchiest songs ever to prominently feature the dulcimer. Even beyond the album title, everything Super Furry means more than it seems. ""Atomik Lust"" is apparently about Ieuan's fear of flying as well as ""if-it's-not-love-then-it's-the-bomb"" apocalyptic romance-- complete with ""turbulence"" sound effects. Jurassic, galactic goof ""Psyclone!"" can also be about Creationism, re-branded these days as ""intelligent design."" ""Zoom!"" was originally performed in a 2001 Peel session with inscrutable nonsense lyrics instead of its current ashen-faced wordplay. On ""Walk You Home"", Ciárán sings, ""The future ain't what it used to be."" The line has been attributed to Yogi Berra, French symbolist poet Paul Valery, and Arthur C. Clarke. At its essence, Love Kraft is an assertion that the future-- and the present-- don't need to be that way at all; indeed, they can be however we imagine them. On album-closing ""Cabin Fever"", a piano comedown worthy of Dennis Wilson's overlooked Pacific Ocean Blue, Ciárán gets the last word, so refreshed, so clean: ""The future now is wide open and clear."" Anything's possible.","The Welsh quintet's seventh studio release is its most straightforward ""rock"" album, a record on which the departures underscore the band's long-established strengths.

2. Does it matter if I have seen the movie, and think it's great, and think the music goes with it, but hate the soundtrack on its own?
3. Can I only like the soundtrack because it reminds me of the movie?
4. Is it really a good ""soundtrack"" if I love the music but hate the movie?
5. When pop stars write soundtracks, isn't it better when they just contribute a few ""real"" songs and keep the noodling ""atmospherics"" to a minimum?
6. Why does there have to be noodling, ""atmospheric"" music in movies? I've long held a bias against soundtracks. Not for their use, mind you: a good soundtrack can make a movie better than its sum of train explosions, drug deals and awkward romances. However, taken on their own terms, soundtracks tend to reek of passive-aggression. I can imagine how tough it was to score music that complimented, yet never overwhelmed, a film, but my attention span usually demands more than music that just suggests emotion. Not that original scores are all bad-- I have soft spots for Danny Elfman, Bernard Herrmann and Nino Rota-- but in the best case, I imagine the symbiotic relationship between music and film to be a little more interesting a lot more often. Björk's music for Matthew Barney's Drawing Restraint 9-- in which the singer also stars-- is her second foray into film music (after 2000's Selmasongs), and commits all the crimes and good deeds a soundtrack should. I haven't seen the movie, so I can only guess that throat singers and chimes enhanced it. However, there are context clues suggesting Björk went out of her way to, well, get out of the way of the action onscreen. Pieces like the low brass-heavy ""Hunter Vessel"" and ""Vessel Shimenawa"" alternate the fat squelch of trombones, trumpets, and horns with more ethereal chord clusters, evocative of perhaps a rocky landscape that meets the sea. Stripped of visuals, there is still an impression left, one that nails a kind of cold distance very well, but doesn't sound like anything specifically. Still, I'm most drawn to the songs, and there are some notable ones for Björk fans. First is ""Gratitude"", featuring solo vocals by Will Oldham. The song is very much in the vein of the classic Björkian ballad, with a flowing, seemingly open-ended melody that is running away from conventional pop phraseology as much as it seems ""accessible."" Oldham handles its melodies well, though to my ears, sounds a bit broken and delicate where I imagine Björk would be strident and flighty. Nevertheless, supported by harp, bells and chimes, and featuring neat instrumental interludes that remind me of the xylophones in Steve Reich's Drumming, it's pleasant and unmistakably Björk. However, my favorite song is ""Storm"", which the composer has performed live over the past few years. Over a sinister backdrop of synth, rain, creaking doors (all of which appear and disappear without notice), Björk's lone vocal soars in the chorus (?) like the booming siren of a blue whale who suddenly realized she was the last of her species. The tragic, detached vibe of the track only makes what sounds bitterly lonely all the more pressing. This would have been a highlight on Medulla or Vespertine, much less here. And then there are the rest: A sound art piece based on throat singing (and very reminiscent of Medulla's ""Ancestors""), a longer (and way more excruciating if you don't happen to be into traditional Japanese Noh vocals) exotic vocal piece, some nice, if innocuous electro-music-box stuff and a couple of lesser vocals by Björk (the trippy, plasmatic ballad ""Bath"" and simpler, brighter ""Cetacea""). And that's where I usually end up with moderately interesting soundtracks: A couple of really cool parts, and the rest I don't feel so bad for forgetting. I'm not sure I learned a ton about the form, but Björk's entry is more interesting than most.","Please provide definitive answers for the following questions about soundtracks:

Knitting Needles and Bicycle Bells,Tenement Halls,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a8b1335d7bf1699328/1:1/w_160/4b6ff168.jpg,2005-08-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8300-knitting-needles-and-bicycle-bells/,Merge,"Tenement Halls is just one man, Chris Lopez, the former frontman of the oft-ignored, occasionally maligned (not by me, though) RockATeens. He takes a similar approach to his new project as he did his old band, adding dark lyrics and complex emotions to the pop of the fifties. But where the RockATeens played an artful, echo-laden take on rockabilly, Tenement Halls takes traditional pop and plays it through a murky wall of sound. Knitting Needles and Bicycle Bells builds distinctive walls of instrumentation, mostly from organs, pianos, and guitars. But rather than an inimitable Spector-like sound, where every instrument can be clearly heard, Knitting Needles is muddy. Organs and pianos drone on, and guitars escape from the mire now and then, but it's an impenetrable pastiche of instruments that needs Lopez's voice to pull them out. I think there's some sweeping cello work under the jangling guitars of ""Charlemagne"", but I can't quite tell. That's probably a guitar being plucked in ""Marry Me"", but I can't get past the keyboard effect that sounds like dentist's drill, not to mention one of Knitting Needles whiniest vocal performances. The simple, swaying chord changes are clamoring for a voice to belt out a melody and carry them forward. Lopez wails, begs, and hollers hoarsely at the top of his range, but he never quite sings. Perhaps more sparse instrumentation would have suited Lopez' romantic melodies. The speedy skip of ""Plenty Is Never Enough"" gets by on just acoustic guitar and a few pounded keys, and it's one of the album's more tolerable songs. If you're stalwart enough to have made it this far into the disc, you still have to deal with ""Marry Me"", and that's enough to send anyone over the nearest bridge even before hearing the toy-piano plink of ""When the Swifts Come Home"" or the swinging church bell sing-along ""Wicked Wicked Ways"". Lyrically, Lopez sounds like a defeated man. No matter how perky opener ""Silver from the Silt"" sounds, it's weighed down by the repetition of ""Just quit, just quit, it's the best you will find down"", full of resignation. ""Now She Knows"" spits disillusionment through it's muddy meandering, with lines like ""All that glitters isn't gold/ It's just shimmering paint on a cast-iron saint/ A scotch-sucking brute in a Brooks Brothers suit"", a quirky bit of antiquated bile. Lopez likely has more perspective these days, and he's brave for starting over in the face of relative apathy towards his old band, but as the lone player and producer here, he could still use some guidance and maybe another set of ears.","One-man, Merge-released project from Chris Lopez, former leader of the RockATeens.

Alpine Static,Kinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbeea9e61561daa72ee/1:1/w_160/ecf98888.jpg,2005-08-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4464-alpine-static/,Sub Pop,"When Kinski put together this album, they seem to have left the melodies in the box-- most of the tracks simply don't have one. Opener ""Hot Stenographer"" has a nearly full-minute passage where all it does is go ""buh! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh!"" until the fade-out-- fuzzed-out guitar and drums slamming every beat while nothing else happens. Other than that, the song is merely a neat riff without a song surrounding it. Alpine Static is full of fine musicianship, but there are a lot of songs that feel like something's missing, and that's a syndrome that I've noticed on truckloads of recent instrumental albums, including a few previous Kinski efforts. It's unfortunate that so many vocal-less seem allergic to offering the listener something to latch onto beyond a wall of fuzzy guitar and an occasional tempo shift. To their credit, Kinski do sometimes give you more than just riffs and drums fills on Alpine Static, such as the tweaked-out solos that rampage over ""The Wives of Artie Shaw"" (guess you gotta solo if you're gonna name a track after Shaw). The thing is, Kinski in rock mode, where they spend the majority of this LP, is Kinski at their weakest, considerably less interesting than when they put on their other hat, which is made of elegantly sculpted, brooding space-noise. Their last record, 2004's Don't Climb on and Take the Holy Water, focused on this sound to often arresting results, but this album mostly sounds like backpedaling until ""All your Kids Have Turned to Static"", a slowly meandering piece of pastoral psych with flute coloring the edges. It's the only track of its kind in the Kinski catalog, and it's one of their best. Unfortunately, it's only an island in a sea, and that sea churns with distortion and kickdrum, frequently feeling directionless. ""The Snowy Parts of Scandinavia"" has a promising intro of slowly morphing ambience, but it devolves into an inept rip-off of Mogwai's ""Like Herod"" before churning into what sounds like a Sonic Youth outtake, circa 1991. So the album as a whole is intensely frustrating. Kinski have the potential, the skill, the other requisite intangibles to be awe-inspiring, but somehow they keep shooting left of the mark.","Sub Pop issues the latest batch of fuzzy guitars and tempo shifts from this instrumental band.

The Bluffer's Guide to the Flight Deck,Flotation Toy Warning,by: Brian Howe & Brandon Stosuy,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bebac0084474cd0c2f1e/1:1/w_160/d79a96ad.jpg,2005-08-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3345-the-bluffers-guide-to-the-flight-deck/,Misra,"If Flotation Toy Warning is out to lull listeners with sheer melodic excess, perhaps it's working a little too well. Over the course of the band's elegant avant-pop debut, it subjugates effect to ambition, inflating concise pop sound-bites to epic proportions (10 songs in a daunting 72 minutes). Sitting at the digi-pastoral nexus of Scott Walker's overstated vocals, the Flaming Lips' neon popscapes, Brian Eno's ambient experiments, and Neutral Milk Hotel's found-sound dalliance, FTW engages in much repetition that seems unnecessary-- many of these ideas could have been winningly discharged in half the time. Instead, they intricately bloat and dawdle, and you might feel ""over"" a song before it breathes its admittedly gorgeous last. In its first minute alone, ""Happy 13"" gathers up sloshing water samples, wheezy electronics evoking everything from keyboards to bagpipes, crashing drums, acoustic strumming, and a request to ""please leave all shiny objects behind."" Gradually adding spectral harmonies and twinkling detuned piano to this mind-cramming dream travelogue, it shuffles through dizzying permutations. ""Popstar Researching Oblivion"" introduces some common FTW motifs: Chuffing, vaguely martial percussion; wavering organ gasps; ripe, elegiac brass; spangled sheets of reverb; and angelic choruses intoning fat, fallow syllables. The multitude of instrumental parts is so similarly colored and oft-repeated that it sometimes blurs into obscurity, but the band can also be glorious in this state of resonant disarticulation. When Paul Carter hunkers down to tell stories, it's less interesting. Musical standouts ""Donald Pleasance"" and ""Losing Carolina; For Drusky"" broaden the sonic palette further, with trad-indie guitar arpeggios contorting though starry expanses of limpid strings and icy chimelets. Lyrically, the former revolves around Carter's steadfast, suitably despondent eulogy at the funeral of ""our love."" It's a great concept, but as on many of the tracks, the band's sonic accouterments prove more moving than the vague libretto. In the latter, a nightingale song flits around the fairly incomprehensible tale of Drusky, who wanted ""God to return his youth"" while ""resurrecting his mother and his pet pigeon."" The most memorable track might also be the shortest and simplest, ""Happiness Is on the Outside"", which finds Carter casting distant ""hellos"" into an amorphous blizzard of melodic interference. Beating within the chilly precipitation of his a.m.-wire salutation is Carter's most pressing query (even if he sometimes asks it indirectly): ""Can you tell me why you left me here all on my own?"" At song's end he promises, almost threatens, to eventually open the page of his diary that rejoices in solitude, and relates ""how [he] took your throne as the meanest bastard in the all Albuquerque."" But hey, why's the Brit in Albuquerque, and who left him there? Often, the intangibles of his downer vocal timbre denote felt emotion, but Carter would also do well to let loose some colorfully site-specific sentiments, giving his syllables a chance to catch up with the magical Victorian tapestries looping around them.","Almost a year after being issued in the UK, this little-heard album of elegant avant-pop is given a well-deserved U.S. release.

Permanent Record: The Very Best of Violent Femmes,Violent Femmes,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a713d19756521398d3/1:1/w_160/b524bbbc.jpg,2005-08-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8543-permanent-record-the-very-best-of-violent-femmes/,Rhino,"My best friend when I was 16 was a guy named Dave, and he had a family friend who was a freshman at the university in my town. So on weekends Dave and I used to go to this guy's dorm and see if we could blend in at parties, trying to meet college girls by pretending we were college guys. If it sounds like we were operators, bear in mind that neither of us had ever been on a date. I'm pretty sure I'd never so much as held a girl's hand. I think we had the courage to try because the chance of success seemed so remote. There was also the beer. One weekend at some party we wound up talking to two girls who seemed to find us amusing. I'm not sure if I understood then the distinction between ""laughing at"" and ""laughing with,"" but the important thing was they were standing there near us, chuckling once in a while. Eventually they asked if we'd like to go back to their room to hang out. What a question! They were on the other side of the elevators and we followed them down and filed in and sat on the floor as one of them went to the stereo to put on a record. She handed me the album cover and it looked strange, an antiquated photograph of a young girl on a creaky porch peering into a window, presumably at something forbidden. My recall of hearing the record is fuzzy but I remember the reaction of our hosts. This music transformed them completely. They became unhinged, shouting lyrics to each other and dancing across the floor as we sat motionless and confused. It was, frankly, terrifying. I felt completely unmoored, awkwardly wondering what to do in the face of such extreme behavior. It quickly became clear to us that we were extraneous, that the only reason we all went back to their room was so they could put on this one particular record. We were in way over our heads. Around the third or fourth song we mumbled something about having to go and slipped out, embarrassed and confused, without so much as a wave goodbye. What was this music that inspired such ecstasy? Violent Femmes, of course, the self-titled debut, with lead singer Gordon Gano as the creepy but strangely alluring backdoor man. Gano was Jonathan Richman with an unsteady moral compass, sharing Jo Jo's love of the Velvet Underground, 1950s rockabilly, and romanticized teenage life, but instead of looking for someone to care about his eyes were drawn to your pants. The instantly catchy tunes and clever songs were fused with an original and complimentary production, a bare-bones acoustic minimalism, all played on 10 steel strings and a single snare drum. It was one the finest debuts of the 80s, eventually going platinum and developing a long life in fraternity houses and on the stands of college pep bands, well outside of what would seem its natural habitat. Violent Femmes was such a perfect expression of geeky teenage angst and lust that there was no way to follow it, and the band never really tried. They soon after released Hallowed Ground, a very good album with a markedly different focus, but failed to build any real momentum through the rest 80s. Albums still come out every three years or so and Violent Femmes is still a tour draw with a cult of fans, but no other album has had near the impact of the debut. Permanent Record is the band's third best-of since 1991. This definitely beats the 1993 compilation Add It Up for both consistency and track selection, although both inexplicably omit ""Prove My Love"". That's the problem with a hits comp from a band known mostly for one album: you can only repeat so many songs from the catalog's biggest seller. Six of the 17 songs here are from the debut, including a live version of ""Good Feeling"" as a bonus track. All of these, of course, are great. From Hallowed Ground, ""Black Girls"" is still fun, with Gano's sharpest sneer and a sax solo by John Zorn to match. ""Jesus Walking on the Water"" and ""Country Death Song"" (unfortunately a live version) reflect Gano's upbringing as the son of a Baptist minister who obviously listened to a whole bunch of Hank Sr. ""American Music"" presents a kinder and gentler Violent Femmes, too many drugs and home alone on the night of the prom but with a quintessential melody and chords to keep the outlook shiny and the appeal universal. Beyond these songs there's a marked dip in quality, a few OK songs but ultimately too many lackluster melodies swaddled in generic rock production. Still, they've earned the right to keep going, and they had a moment most bands would kill for. All those happy shouts from drunken kids add up to a lot.","Third best-of compilation from the Milwaukee group unsurprisingly leans heavily to the band's debut LP.

Belladonna,Daniel Lanois,by: Stephen M.

Known for twiddling nobs for U2, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Emmylou Harris, and even Willie Nelson, Lanois has always appeared to want out of the constricted control room and onto the open stage, and over the past two decades, he has made a handful of albums full of low-key singer-songwriter fare as well as numerous ambient-oriented collaborations with Brain Eno. Needless to say, these records sound great, but they don't always hold up extremely well. Like Quentin Tarantino delivering a dramatic line reading, Lanois's considerable talents are weakest when it comes to composition. Inspired by a trip to Mexico, Belladonna sounds technically flawless-- every marimba strike and fret run has a specific texture that's almost miniaturist in its realistic detail-- but it's all in service to vocal-less songs that are ponderous and dull, whose strict adherence to an overriding motif hems them in. Belladonna refers to the herb Atropa belladonna, or deadly nightshade, whose poison results in, among other symptoms, total loss of voice-- which makes it a particularly apt title for an album of instrumentals. The overall scheme is almost soundtrack-like in nature, or rather like a nature soundtrack. Rumbling feedback on opener ""Two Worlds"" suggests storms on the horizon, time-delay shots of clouds morphing rapidly past-- New Agey mood scenes conveying the passage of time or the amorality of an arid desert floor. The songs that follow take a similar tack, and song titles refer to south-of-the-border locales or fauna -- ""Oaxaca"", ""Agave"", ""Desert Rose"", ""Todos Santos"" -- giving specificity to the vague evocations of the music. For better or worse, such earthly signposts work to ground the music's spacey ambience. Lanois communicates this ethereality mostly through his pedal steel, which recalls Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, his 1983 collaboration with Eno. Lanois manages to coax some lovely textures and melodies out of the instrument, as on the florid notes of ""Desert Rose"" and ""Carla"", but typically it gets lost among the other elements, proving the least compelling element on the album. As a result, the songs often fold into one another, distinguishable only by inspired flourishes like the reggae rhythms of ""Frozen"", the Mariachi horns on ""Agave"" and Brad Mehldau's sparkling keyboard melodies on ""Sketches"". Lanois is aiming for a kind of ascetic aesthetic, with each song a sort of musical haiku: concise, disciplined, sublime. But on Belladonna less is not more, but merely much less. The album is so stuffy and self-serious that it practically demands your respect and admiration. However, it rarely commands your attention, so it doesn't reward much of anything.","Famed producer (U2, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel) releases his latest set of low-key singer-songwriter music.

Forget Starsailor, Keane, or any other one-word, sleepy-head outfit, Reykjavik ensemble the Leaves are pulling off the best Coldplay masquerade right now. Sure, they play the same bubble-wrapped pop, but at least it feels like the first time. From the slurred coos to the airy, angelic falsetto choruses, frontman Arnar Gudjonsson is an impeccable Chris Martin 2.0, though he's armed with more dignified lyrics than ""there could be computers/ Looking for life on Earth."" The lush instrumentation also handcuffs these guys to Martin and Co., with The Angela Test sounding like a Coldplay studio session highjacked by equally benevolent terrorists. Whether intentional or not, Leaves often circumvent these similarities on more ethereal, sprawling numbers. Bookmarked by ""Shakma (Drunken Starlit Sky)"" and ""Should Have Seen It All"", which span over a combined 17 minutes, they flirt with Sigur Rós experimentation though ultimately opt for protracted pop song structures and direct, larger-than-life vocals. Unfortunately that dabbling sets the limit for how deep the Leaves wish to explore, and most of the album mires in a mid-tempo post-Britpop bog. You know the type-- a soft piano cues even softer vocals, some processed strings give their two cents, drums that might as well be strings, and a few teaser guitar parts before the song explodes into an epiphany of a refrain large enough to affront a god. Laughable as the formula may sound, the Leaves occasionally make gravy with it, particularly on single ""The Spell"" and ""Killing Flies"", a two-faced lullaby that mutates into a strident early-MBV noise collage. Mostly, however, this formula falls flat on its face, and Gudjonsson resigns to the ole' ""I'm gonna keep holding this note until it sounds pretty"" bit, taking yet another page from Martin's book. ""Good Enough"" is a commendable stab at rocking, but those distorted guitars can't hide the uncanny resemblance to ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"". While the mimicry is frustrating, it's hard to really flog these guys. For whatever it's worth, they're doing the Coldplay thing better than Coldplay, sans the whole self-conscious, self-important idée fixe.

Seldom has this familial bond appeared as literal, however, as with the release of Wedlock, a double album recorded in Alaska at the wedding of group members Paul Labrecque and Valerie Webb. And though the live, impromptu nature of these recordings means they contain some of the group's slackest, most loosely-organized performances yet-- certainly no mean feat-- the album also captures several peaks of the spontaneous joy and inspired mutual discovery that typify the group's best work. Sunburned Hand of the Man's creative timeline has always been too wavy and discursive to strictly delineate any pure trends or patterns, but the June 2003 date of these recordings lands them somewhere chronologically and sonically between the release of their 2002 album Headdress and that of Trickle Down. At least a dozen group-related musicians-- including such honorary band members as Chris Corsano-- made the voyage to Alaska to celebrate, make music, and (apparently) fly-fish, though it certainly sounds as though none of the other wedding guests were discouraged from active participation. Wedlock opens with ""The Procession"", the only track included that was not recorded at the actual wedding itself. Instead, this piece is a loose assemblage of various fragments gathered on the journey to Alaska, and it immediately sets the album's tone of loopy, high-spirited adventure. Woven together by bassist Rob Thomas, the finished track features snatches of acoustic slide guitar, engine hums, police sirens and numerous samples of infectious laughter, vaguely resembling some of John Fahey's late-90s abstract collages. From there on the album unfolds in virtual real time, as the subsequent six live tracks appear in the same order they were played at what must have been one whale of a ceremony. ""The Tent City Police"", which sounds like it could be a Headdress outtake, is anchored by Thomas' wickedly funky bassline, glimmering Bitches Brew keys, and distorted, impressionistic vocals that (one can only assume) transmit bountiful good tidings to the happy couple. Later on, percussive, unfettered improvisations like ""Sunshine Suit"" and the extended title track are increasingly punctuated by rippling, Jerry Garcia-like single-note guitar runs as well as by the ambient peripheral conversations of the ongoing wedding reception. As the evening progresses, the group gradually transition to more acoustic instrumentation, portable hand percussion, and ever-looser song structures. Cuts like ""The Agency"" and ""Double Invincibility"" eventually devolve into a primitive, Godz-like gypsy flutter, and though undoubtedly great fun to experience live, their disheveled charms generally decrease with each successive playback. But, as the album closes with Dave Bird's gracious best man speech, one is reminded that Wedlock's music was constructed as a mere complement to the bonds of friendship and family, and that it is those bonds that provide this album its lasting, understated resonance.","This double album was recorded at the wedding of group members Paul Labrecque and Valerie Webb and is among the band's loosest and most-inspired.

The Gospel Record,Derek Bailey,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fc9d034d5c69bf2ab3/1:1/w_160/057f2120.jpg,2005-08-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/531-the-gospel-record/,Shaking Ray,"I'm hard pressed to find a kind of music less ingratiated by new music fans than gospel. You'd think that any music containing drums and guitars and feverish singing would find a willing (secular) audience, so perhaps it's the faith that jumbles the translation. Of course, gospel-studded résumés abound in r&b;, but even then, it's generally an aesthetic component of gospel singing rather than actual hymns that makes it the radio. Popular faith-based (okay, Christianity-based) music is out there-- survey scattered songs Sufjan Stevens, Kanye West, U2, Pedro the Lion-- but in rock, more generally accepted are an occasional God shout out at the Grammys or the dreaded backing choir, aka Foreigner's and R. Kelly's secret weapon. Something seems amiss. So, when free jazz guys and avant-garde singers come along and put their spin on gospel tunes, I'm struck. British guitarist Derek Bailey is no stranger to covers: Despite almost 50 years of free improvisation, his beginnings were in pop standards with a small jazz combo, and 2002's Ballads found him revisiting that mode, albeit in his uber-idiosyncratic style. On The Gospel Record, he joins American composer/vocalist Amy Denio (Science Group, EC Nudes, Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet) and synth/sampler improviser Dennis Palmer for a short set of old-time gospel-- as in, the kind featured on Smithsonian anthologies or Coen brothers movies-- and in the process, exposes music ripe for the interpretive plucking. After a short spoken invocation in the slowed down drawl of a surreal Southern preacher, Denio and Palmer harmonize the verses of Albert E. Brumley's ""Let the Little Sunbeam In"" over Bailey's sometimes tonal, sometimes way-out distorted electric guitar. Denio's vocals are clear as day, sounding very much like the star of modest country church, and the trio keeps the original harmonies intact. Bailey's accompaniment is perfect, elegantly suggesting the original chord progression with spiked drones and the occasional shard of dissonance. W. Oliver Cooper and Minzo C. Jones' ""Heaven Will Surely Be Worth It All"" gets a rougher treatment, with Palmer's martial, oppressive drum machine going to battle with Bailey's flickering, pointillist figures. Again, Denio's pure alto seems non-phased by the chaos around, though is kept at bay by the electric storm. Classic Southern hymn ""The Ole-Time Religion"" is presented as an instrumental and features more pounding drum machine backing Bailey's scattershot lines. Palmer also injects some synth sounds, running the gamut from eerie backwards percussion noises to what sounds like a small UFO taking off. This leads straight into Vep Ellis' ""Joshua Led God's Children"", as Denio's solo vocal is doubled by a rubbery bass patch from Palmer. During the refrain, Denio goes into the stratosphere with her vocals, singing in an unnaturally high register; she ends the song on a high note too, and the reverb from her vocal acts as the song's momentary fade-out. ""I'm Gonna See Heaven"" brings the vocal harmonies back, but is almost completely overtaken by Palmer's stomping, chomping synth and drum machine attack. Bailey is almost buried by the frenzy, though his guitar's overtones punctuate the brief silences in between electro-squelches. Sometimes, the interpretations border on the surreal, though I'm more taken with the whirlwind pace: all of these songs are crammed into just over 14 minutes. The trio ends The Gospel Record with a rare moment of tenderness during the final phrase of ""I'm Bound for the Land of Canaan"", I'm reminded of the traveling sideshows that went through the American South 100 years ago, featuring all manner of decidedly non-sacred entertainments only to close with a group hymn before skipping town. If Bailey, Denio and Palmer have subversive aims, this music succeeds in spite of itself.

Twin Cinema,The New Pornographers,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e55e6ef9596932392a/1:1/w_160/c5e5c64a.jpg,2005-08-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5773-twin-cinema/,Matador,"Of all the genres that roam the indie rock biosphere, the one that probably gets cut the most slack is power pop, which eschews influences that peaked in the past three decades, moves within a sonic range between the Ramones and Beach Boys, and whose bands are aware there's a loyal audience waiting to lap up their derivative, harmony-laden, verse-chorus-verse songs. Existing against this dire backdrop makes the New Pornographers look even more singular. It's almost unfair, in a way, given that the Pornographers aren't so much a band as a Davis Cup team of Canada's finest indie singer-songwriters, captained by veteran Carl Newman. When Newman, Destroyer's Dan Bejar, and Neko Case first got together (with, it should be noted, other random Canadians) to record Mass Romantic, it seemed to be a goofy, feverish one-off, like a boozy weekend that accidentally birthed an indie pop classic. When the LP became arguably bigger than any of their individual endeavors, the three reunited for Electric Version, but couldn't keep the momentum rolling, suggesting the project's magic was fleeting. Twin Cinema doesn't just rebut that notion, it renders it ludicrous. With more developed ideas than Mass Romantic and a more cohesive sound than Electric Version, it's their most consistent, confident, and best album to date. Newman is once again at the wheel for the majority of the LP, furthering the notion that the New Pornographers are just Zumpano with added starpower. But this time Newman folds in the more mature sound he pursued whilst under the name A.C., focusing more on rich, Joe Jackson-style piano than arcade keyboards, and getting a lot of mileage out of the ebow. Newman's characteristic pop gems are present and accounted for (""Sing Me Spanish Techno"", ""Use It""), but most thrilling are the moments where he expands his sound, be it the disorienting, cyclical chorus of ""Falling Through Your Clothes"" or the shrilly upper-register, surprisingly funky ""Three or Four"". It's a small disappointment that Neko Case's internal vocoder isn't applied to another rave-up, but Newman directs her well through two ballads, the off-kilter ""The Bones of an Idol"" and the wistful ""These Are the Fables"". Even Bejar contributes tracks that actually sound like they were recorded with the rest of the band in the room. ""Jackie, Dressed in Cobras"" may or may not revive the character from his Mass Romantic highlight, but it's a perfect integration of Bejar's acrid vocals into the more hyper Pornographer sound, the corners softened by Case's Children's Workshop harmonies and Newman's piano punctuations. Yet in the upset of the year, it's drummer Kurt Dahle who practically steals Twin Cinema's show. On prior NP efforts the drums were almost an afterthought. Here the percussion is pushed to the front of the mix, and Dahle's swing and crash put tracks like ""The Jessica Numbers"" and ""The Bleeding Heart Show"" over the top. The eight-armed drumming that fills every corner of ""Use It"", or The Soft Bulletin-esque drum-bash coda to ""These Are the Fables"" allow Newman to continue his indulgence with the Who (reference ""35 in the Shade"" with ""Boris the Spider""), nicking ""Armenia City in the Sky"" for the more astral portions of ""Stacked Crooked"". The added rhythmic complexity is just one way in which the New Pornographers successfully tweak established formulas and set themselves apart. Sure, at their core, the songs of Twin Cinema have that catchy, melodic something that forces me to reach repeatedly for the p-word, but for Newman & co., instant hummability isn't the endpoint but the foundation. Whether it's weaving in opaque, double-meaning lyrics or sneaking a horn part way deep in the mix, the compositions on Twin Cinema are immediate yet multi-layered. They'd be great in their own right, but by comparison to the plagiaristic, closed-minded, infinitely repeating world of power pop, it's all the more special an accomplishment.","The Canadian power-pop supergroup's latest full-length is its most consistent, confident, and best album to date.

Acoustica,Alarm Will Sound,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c69d034d5c69bf2a32/1:1/w_160/8811dcbe.jpg,2005-08-18 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/481-acoustica/,Cantaloupe,"It's tempting to look for an angle when ostensibly ""traditional"" artists re-interpret music originally conceived for an entirely different context. You wonder if they're making a statement first and thinking about the music second. It can seem as though the artist with a stronger connection to high culture is either extending a hand down to welcome the other half into the club. Or, perhaps they're just having a laugh. A string quartet is playing Metallica songs, see, because Metallica are actually interesting composers. See also Sebastian Cabot, Actor/Bob Dylan, Poet. New music ensemble Alarm Will Sound decided to follow its album of Steve Reich compositions with a record of all-acoustic interpretations of pieces by the Aphex Twin, but nothing about the project suggests condescension. Based on the music and presentation this seems more like an ambitious collective on the hunt for challenging projects, and the idea of scoring and arranging pieces that have lived their entire lives inside a computer was too tempting to pass up. In a sense Richard D. James seems the natural choice for such a tribute, both because of his surpassing melodic sense and that he's already penetrated the serious world through collaboration with Philip Glass. A large assortment of hoses, whistles, shop hardware, and piano treatments were gathered for timbral approximations, after the tracks were selected (curiously, most are from most from Drukqs) and notated, and this is the result. Though it never sounds to me like a gimmick, Acoustica remains oddly distant and difficult to inhabit. This music, often geared toward atmosphere and sound for sound's sake, is difficult to absorb when scored for traditional instruments and easily slips into the background. Generally, the better and more exciting the original track, the more the Alarm Will Sound version pales by comparison. On tracks like ""Meltphace 6"" where the distinctive rolling drums serve as the lead instrument, Alarm Will Sound sounds overly restrained, with its conservatory roots at the Eastman School of Music in full view. That they would even attempt to record something like ""Cock/Ver 10"" live with acoustic instruments is impressive, certainly, but the music itself doesn't quite survive the translation and loses its sense of purpose. Better are the tracks that were in their initial form more open-ended. The short industrial percussion ditty ""Prep Gwarlek 3B"" finds new life with live instrumentation, and its unusual rhythm and texture easier becomes easier to digest. The digital gamelan ""Jynweythek Ylow"" loses a pang of longing without the sound of James's music box, but Alarm Will Sound find the melodic core at the piece's center. Still, though Acoustica is an interesting album and not unpleasant to listen to, but nowhere does it capture James's energy or musical wit. It reminds me of when Derrick May did an Invisible Jukebox session for the UK experimental music magazine The Wire and the interviewer played him a brass band version of ""Strings of Life"". His strong initial excitement quickly dissipated and he groaned, ""Oh, I wish it were better.""","All-acoustic interpretations of pieces by Aphex Twin.

Gods and Monsters,I Am Kloot,by: Rachel Khong,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a113d197565213aeca/1:1/w_160/e4aa3713.jpg,2005-08-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4158-gods-and-monsters/,Echo,"After two albums of post-Britpop mediocrity, Manchester trio I Am Kloot kick things up a notch (or think they do), and suffer from bipolarity and an ambition that outstrips their ability. The disc plays like a sex operation gone botched-- Adonis to Medusa in 10 minutes tops. Three songs into a promising start, the I Am Kloot of yesteryear rears its lyrically asinine head, which wouldn't be so bad if the Kloot didn't regard themselves as ""Harold Pinter real deal to everyone else's overblown, Cecil B. de Mille mock-ups."" More problems arise when this band wants to be somebody's soundtrack-- all vampires and exotic places-- and from there the degeneration's traceable: The straightforward ""No Direction"" largely succeeds, ""Over My Shoulder"" straddles the good-to-ugly divide, and ""An Ordinary Girl"" is a full-blown suck-fest. Moody Doves-like undercurrents work in small doses but wilt when spooned out in large doses. If you're looking for reference points, Cinerama's shtick isn't far off, except that was smart. You never caught David Gedge singing about the ""bald raging flame of your heart"" or recounting Gothic tales of ""ordinary"" girls in what he thinks are fifty-pence words. I Am Kloot singer John Bramwell's execution is gloomily expressive at best, melodramatic as a rule, and when the Wurlitzers materialize like dry ice at a Backstreet Boys concert, shit's more exasperating than convincing-- and tiresome, too. While it's true that stories don't tell themselves, Kloot's stories might speak volumes if Bramwell sang less. Loungey ""Avenue of Hope"" could be an Angry Inch B-side, if this Hedwig were a wholly sincere woman with a deep voice and razor-thin vocal range instead of an affected man with with an overdeveloped sense of misanthropy and a razor-thin vocal range. ""Hong Kong Lullaby"" feels like a cheap shot at fluffy pillow-softness, offering respite from billowing swells of over-instrumentation but little else; ""I Believe"", a weirdly compelling Nick Drake anthem-cum-rescue mission, comes tacked on as a bedside prayer finale that also fails to salvage or move (to tears or otherwise) thanks to the tyranny of circumstance. For all their godlike aspiration, it's a shame that I Am Kloot basically don't do Genesis.","Ambitious effort from the post-Britpop combo.

Infiniheart,Chad VanGaalen,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a6c0084474cd0c108a/1:1/w_160/11919d8c.jpg,2005-08-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8542-infiniheart/,Sub Pop,"Maybe this is just an American's projection onto our northerly neighbors, but I imagine Chad VanGaalen knows the cold very intimately. He hails from Calgary, where he busked street corners and subways for years, gradually building up a large catalog of original songs. Using a variety of instruments and equipment-- some of which he's fashioned by hand-- the relentless DIY'er has recorded hundreds of his songs in a makeshift studio in his bedroom, where you can imagine him retreating from a frigid evening. On his debut album, Infiniheart, which was released in Canada earlier this year and which Sub Pop is now releasing domestically, that crisp chill hangs over every chiming note and every booming beat. Even the packaging cannot escape the cold front: Snow-white and ice-blue dominate the cover artwork, and the inner sleeve is wind-chapped pink. This chilliness suggests an album full of spare, soft songs conveying subtle emotions, which is accurate but only to a degree. While he keeps his accompaniment to a minimum, VanGaalen is no minimalist. His songs are balanced with only a few carefully chosen elements, as if he has expended a great deal of energy trying to avoid adding another instrument here or overworking a beat there. But the range of sounds on Infiniheart is impressively wide: When VanGaalen culled these 16 from the hundreds in his vault, he chose with an ear toward the eclectic, showcasing his musical ingenuity. In fact, there's an almost maximalist spectrum of sound on Infiniheart, and the album is all the more impressive for creating and maintaining such a specific mood over 16 songs. Brushes stir against snares on ""Blood Machine"" imitating slow respiration, and the prismatic guitars of ""Liquid + Light"" and ""Somewhere I Know There Is Nothing"" evoke the cutting cold in the air and the sharp glare of sunlight off frozen snow. On ""1000 Pound Eyelids"" a bleary trumpet suggests the bending metal and breaking bones of a car crash, and the sharp notes of a dobro and a breezy penny whistle pierce ""Sunshine Snare Hits"". VanGaalen's guitar can be gentle or brutal, his beats reserved or ostentatious, and he has sequenced the album to showcase this dynamic. The two-guitar coda of ""Kill Me in My Sleep"", which is perhaps best described as ""gossamer"", is immediately followed by the instrumental ""J.C.'s Head on the Cross"", which bounces frenetically on thudding beats. He sings these songs in a voice that stretches towards a shivering falsetto, which cracks noticeably on ""Chronograph #1"" and adds to the otherworldliness of ""Red Blood"" and the videogamey ""The Warp Zone/Hidden Bridge"". If this chilliness enlivens the music, it unfortunately dampens VanGaalen's songwriting, which relies too heavily on weighty, sci-fi concepts that seem frozen and immobile. In theory, such reliance suggests a unique vision, unflinching in its conception and execution, but in practice, he too often sounds coldly remote, more aloof than elusive. ""Clinically Dead"" starts the album with the demise of a man-machine: ""Clinically he was dead, and the modem inside his head was still working."" Conceptually, it recalls the Flaming Lips (who based an entire album on the heartbreaking inner conflict of a crime-fighting cartoon) and Grandaddy (who based an entire album on the melding of humanity and machines in a post-apocalyptic world), but those artists play with the distance between their subject matter and the emotions they intend to communicate. Very rarely does any self-awareness come through on Infiniheart. When his flights of fancy are anchored in the actual, Infiniheart becomes a powerful combination of words and music. ""After the Afterlife"" asks about such mundane matters as a mother's haircut and a father's drug habit before conjuring eerie seaweed imagery that hints at tragedy. And ""Chronograph #1"", about a party whose guest of honor is noticeably absent, possesses more gravity than any of his oddball lyrics. But still, those cumbersome songs stand out the most, especially ""Blood Machine"", which imagines a Matrix-like underworld where everyone is hooked up to a ""giant machine that could circulate blood."" He tries to connect it to larger, existential issues, but despite the fluttering guitarwork, the song falls flat: ""One of them explained to me/ how they used to be free/ Before the machines got built/ And before there were laws regulating free will."" To his credit, VanGaalen invests those clunky lines with a vocal intensity that's surprisingly graceful and even poignant. That's ultimately the sticking point with *Infiniheart: VanGaalen's songs tend toward folly, yet it's impossible to discount his commitment to the material. *","Already out in his native Canada, this singer-songwriters debut LP of spare, soft songs is now issued by Sub Pop.

Give Blood,Brakes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49513d1975652138d3f/1:1/w_160/3229ff12.jpg,2005-08-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1173-give-blood/,Rough Trade,"Give Blood falls squarely in the ""pleasant surprise"" camp; a gift to short attention spans everywhere. Also including members of Electric Soft Parade and the Tenderfoot, Brakes is fronted by British Sea Power's Eamon Hamilton, and besides Hamilton's mealy-mouthed singing, the only thing the two bands share is a record deal with Rough Trade. Forget wall-of-sound pop glamour; forget coded references to Dostoevsky; forget ruminative death ballads and arcane concepts. Blazing through 16 songs in less than half an hour-- the longest clocking in at about three-and-a-half minutes, the shortest at seven seconds-- Brakes has turned out a weird, riotous post-(cow)punk screed. Yeah, cowpunk. A country twang creeps into the album periodically: Check the bright jangle of ""NY Pie"", where Hamilton affects a hilarious Southern drawl (American punk bands have been mangling British accents forever, and turnabout's fair play) to riff on big-city dreams with the curious but intuitively coherent refrain, ""Oh, get me a pony."" But the stylistic hopscotch doesn't stop there. The shuffle beat, lockstep bass, and explosive post-punk chorus of ""All Night Disco Party"" winks slyly in DFA's direction. The 30-second ""Pick Up the Phone"" precisely apes the Fall, with its careening chords and histrionic vocal rhythm. ""I Can't Stand to Stand Beside You"" is textbook Mission of Burma, with its abrupt shifts between gliding, repetitive menace and fist-pumping pop-punk choruses, while songs like ""You'll Always Have a Place to Stay"" and ""The Most Fun"" trade in aggression for dirgey indie-pop. If it sounds all over the place, it is, but because Brakes couch their divagations in directness and simplicity, it all hangs together. Their scene-baiting rants and snotty, high-octane punk fill the void vacated by the late, great Mclusky, masters of the pointedly absurd tirade. Like Mclusky, Brakes are at their best when they're sending up the scene and its discontents. ""Heard About Your Band"" could be an answer to Art Brut's ""Formed a Band"": ""I heard about your band/ Whatever dude!"" With lines like ""You should have brought Karen O"" and ""You met Electralene, eh?"", Hamilton sneers at trendy rockers, and thankfully, he comes off more like a petty, mean-spirited prick than a self-righteous artiste. ""Hi How Are You?"" begins with a précis of scenester pick-up lines, including ""what do you do,"" ""how do you dress,"" and ""who are your friends,"" before being abruptly cockblocked with ""Won't you shut the fuck up, I'm just trying to watch the band."" And Brakes sum up their political stance on ""Cheney"", which wreaks havoc for all of 10 seconds, stating in its entirety: ""Cheney, Cheney, Cheney, stop being such a dick!"" Too often, satirical rock gets so caught up in the conceit it forgets to rock, but Hamilton and co. never forget the wisdom of Blues Traveler: ""The hook brings you back."" Now someone get this man a pony.","Low-rent UK supergroup features British Sea Powers Eamon Hamilton as well as members of Electric Soft Parade and the Tenderfoot.

May 23rd 2007,The Kallikak Family,by: Cory D.

Goddard. The book also provided the backbone for the group's debut LP, The Vineland Social Maturity Scale, which combined subtle pop melodies, organic folk, and bits of electronic noise. For their newest release, Kallikak brainchild Andrew Peterson has moved even further away from traditional structure, employing layers of field recordings, ambient noise, and non-verbal vocals to create an outstanding cut/paste ambient collage that is propelled by a continuous onslaught of fresh ideas, wistful beauty, and haunting arrangements. May 23rd 2007 is also a sort of concept album, telling the story of a time-obsessed man and the date on which he is expected to die, both of which are identified as May 23rd 2007. Much of that storyline is beside the point, though, since it isn't indicated anywhere in the album's beautiful packaging or, for that matter, in the music itself. There are no lyrics to tell a story, only sliced bits of vocal noises and the occasional ooh and ahh. Instead, Peterson constructs textures of sound based primarily on ambient noise. Unlike most album that are tagged ""ambient,"" May 23rd 2007 constantly shifts and morphs between engaging sounds and styles, drifting from drones to c'n'p edits to pastoral folk. At once comforting and alien, the record blends pop sensibilities and snatches of delicate, off-kilter melody with free-flowing experimentation and avant-garde leanings. Several tracks incorporate breakbeat-style electronic drums (most notably the title track and ""Portland, Oregon part 4""), and two songs are delivered via acoustic guitar (the appropriately titled ""Guitar 1"" and ""Guitar 2""), but for the most part May 23rd 2007 is an amalgam of tones, sampled snippets, and tape manipulation. Given this description, there are many artists who come to mind (the Books, the Wind-Up Bird, even Philip Glass), but to confuse similarity of style with similarity of ideas is to sell all of those artists short. The Kallikak Family succeeds by creating a beautiful, flowing piece of music that is at once engaging and understated. At times it can be heart-wrenchingly sad, yet the uplifting are both impassioned and beautiful. With 17 tracks, each averaging about two minutes in length, Peterson gets the most out of his ideas, building a record that blends seamlessly yet shifts shapes both over the course of the LP and within each track. As a result, the true magnitude of May 23rd 2007 seeps out slowly, divulging more of its secrets with each listen.","At times reminiscent of the Books, this outstanding cut/paste ambient collage is propelled by a continuous onslaught of fresh ideas.

The insert from their second CD features three carefully sloppy young men, their eyes just peeking out behind stray locks, looking contemplative, chugging beer, doing headstands, playing guitar while crowd surfing, and generally bathing themselves in empty singnifiers. An album of candid songs from in front of the family fireplace seems unlikely. None of that matters as long as they've got the tunes, though, right? They don't. The Cribs put all their cards on the table before the first track is finished. ""Hey Scenesters"" features good ol' staccato Telecaster angular-ass guitars, a danceable beat, and a shout-along hook, not to mention an echo-drenched vocal counter-melody for maximum catchiness. Singer Ryan Jarman doesn't try too hard, of course, lest the band reveal some trace of passion or ability. Maybe they think deriding ""scenesters"" in the lyrics to such a derivative song is a clever bit of irony; it's actually just transparent, and it doesn't let them off the hook. Or maybe it's lost on them entirely. I'd believe it, given the naive mimcry of some of these songs. The Strokes imitations are frequent and blatant, though they bring a cheeky amateurism to their priacy, if nothing else. ""I'm Alright Me"" and ""We Can No Longer Cheat You"" are all slurred vowels and trebley downstrokes, but with the swaying, off-key chorus of ""We Can No Longer Cheat You"", it's difficult to criticise because it's difficult to even take seriously. The title track, however, borrows so liberally-- right down to the solo not-a-drum-machine drumming before each verse-- it's hard to imagine a live audience not laughing out loud. The band seems more at home playing for punters and having them shouting in the background, with woozy bloke-rock like ""Martell"" and ""It Was Only Love"" hitting more of a comfort zone. Their sloppy pub-rock is less deserving of ire, and yet no more deserving of a listen.","All-brother buzzsaw guitar trio is enjoying some UK hype and NME huzzahs.

On Kore Ga Mayaku Da-- their first U.S. release following a handful of self-released recordings in Japan-- it isn't difficult to hear why their ascent has been so rapid. Though their national origin will surely prompt impulsive comparisons to Melt Banana or early Boredoms, there's something entirely unique going on within Afrirampo's free-form, primal garage-stomps. And on this album they join such acts as Magik Markers or Angelblood out beyond the farthest streetlight of rock's untamed outskirts, where one wrong turn can plunk you directly into the foreboding, impassable wilderness. Afrirampo (the name translates loosely yet accurately to ""naked rock"") is comprised of guitarist Oni and drummer Pikachu, both of whom add wild, lustful vocals that occasionally reach pitches of near-cartoonish intensity. With this denuded instrumental attack the duo recasts the trashy, minimalist garage-rock of groups like the Oblivians or Cheater Slicks into decidedly more personalized abstract forms, using open-ended song structures and free-spirited improvisation to create a mercurial strain of fuzzed-out thunder. While the duo's spare approach necessarily amplifies the relative weight of each individual element of their music, on Kore Ga Mayaku Da it is Oni's guitar that proves to be the group's most indispensable weapon. At a time when noteworthy rock guitarists seem to be in uncommonly short supply, Oni's work here consistently astonishes without being overtly flashy. One minute she sounds to be channeling Johnny Thunders, the next it's a leopard skin-clad Derek Bailey, as throughout the album she bursts enthusiastically from episode-to-episode with a slippery, off-the-cuff grace that suggests that she's not always wholly aware of what her fingers are planning to do next. Behind the drumkit, Pikachu acquits herself as well, keeping pace with-- if not actually anticipating-- Oni's every frantic lane change. The duo certainly waste no time getting down to the nitty-gritty on their ecstatic 13-minute opening gush ""I Did Are,"" a surprisingly metallic, free-flowing epic that changes course roughly every 45 seconds, including an extended mid-song breakdown of dizzy vocalizing and guitar-string chicken clucks. Things get slightly less complicated on blistering tracks like the onomatopoetic ""O"" or the crazed-scales of ""Kairaku Do Re Mi"", while on quieter numbers like ""On Ska to Paar Ya"" or the erotically-charged plea ""Want You"", the duo reveal an unsuspected Jamaican influence, inflecting these songs with languid, echo-heavy dub effects and erstwhile island rhythms. It's never long, however, before Afrirampo are again off and running, joyfully veering to the cusp of feral, white-hot noise, as they drag their songs kicking and screaming towards distant untold possibilities.","Osaka sisters continue their rise through the avant-rock underground, already having recorded with Acid Mothers Temple and toured with Lightning Bolt and Sonic Youth.

The Stooges / Fun House,The Stooges,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bb13d1975652139257/1:1/w_160/f753b75b.jpg,2005-08-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11842-the-stooges-fun-house/,ElektraElektra,"James Osterburg was a man you might not look at twice on the street. Iggy Pop was his animal soul, and when Iggy got loose on a stage just about anything could happen. With the Stooges he was the mesmerizing center of a maelstrom that helped to invent a whole host of rock's musical clichés, a group that spun primal fury and young adult frustration into some of the ugliest, most brutal, most alive music of its era. There were other subversive, confrontational rock acts before the Stooges-- the cover of the band's eponymous debut even subtly references the Doors' own self-titled album-- but nobody before them had the good sense to take it as far over the top as they did. Even the band's sturdiest compositions have a feeling of instability about them, like they might collapse or fly asunder at any moment, and there are moments when Iggy can't help screaming and grunting as if he's trying to challenge Ron Asheton's guitar to some nihilistic duel. In the middle of the hippie era, their grimy, depraved, and violent take on love and life had no natural place, which is perhaps why it holds up so well. The Stooges' first two albums are a case study in a band marking its territory with a debut and then systematically destroying that territory and everything in it on their second. As rough and abrasive as The Stooges is, it sounds positively genteel next to the apocalyptic garage meltdown of Fun House. The debut was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale, an art-conscious violist who worked hard to get the Stooges a crisp, muscular sound that highlighted the bleakness of their vision but made them perhaps less threatening on record than they were on stage. For Fun House, the band got Don Gallucci, whose previous claim to rock trivia fame was as the guy going ""duh duh duh, duh duh, duh duh duh, duh duh"" on the keyboards on the Kingsmen's epochal ""Louie Louie"". Gallucci essentially recorded Fun House as though it were a live album, letting the band simply attack the songs in take after exhausting take, and though the recording is less than perfect from a technical standpoint, it shoves the Stooges at the peak of their powers right in your face. Rhino's reissues do a fine job of shoving them even further, benefitting from improved mastering that highlights the gut-punch rhythm section of Dave Alexander and Scott Asheton, who never get enough credit for being the band's pounding heart and tortured soul. Alexander's bass keeps things grounded in blues and psychedelia, rumbling low and solid in the mix as Ron Asheton's lava guitar flows around it and Dave Asheton pummels out the most basic and accordingly perfect beats possible. The raging caveman groove they lay down on ""1969"" to open the debut is still one of the greatest undercarriages a rock song has ever had. The first album also contains the classic ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"", notable almost as much for its inclusion of piano and sleigh bell in a grinding rock arrangement as it is for its then-controversial refrain. The record also has two songs notable mostly for the fact that they show the band going in a direction they never again pursued: ""We Will Fall"", audaciously sequenced at track three, is a droning, 10-minute dirge featuring a backing chant and Iggy's harrowing narration of a night in a lonely hotel room. The way he sings, ""Then I lay right down/ On my back/ On my bed/ In my hotel"" makes what looks insanely mundane on paper sound like the last existential gasps of a dying mind. Less oppressive but no more upbeat is ""Ann"", which is sort of the album's ballad if you wanted to stretch and call it that. Iggy wails for a lost lover and Ron Asheton reels off a sickeningly fuzzed-out guitar solo that anticipates the most unhinged moments of Fun House. Unhinged is too weak a word for the wildest moments of Fun House, especially closer ""L.A. Blues"", a fiery freakout that's more heroin than LSD and makes no pretense of song structure. Saxophonist Steven Mackay adds a nasty edge to the album's second side, blazing right along with the rest of the band to create a texture that sounds exactly like the album cover-- Iggy tossed in a flaming sea, possibly hell. The record's first half is somewhat tamer, with the heavy boogie of ""Down on the Street"" and the paranoid snarl of ""T.V. Eye"", where the band plays with deadly efficiency behind Iggy's demented vocal. Iggy actually captures the feel of the whole record in the opening line of ""1970"": ""Out of my mind on a Saturday night."" The reissues each add a whole disc of rarities, though hardcore fans will already know the Fun House extras from the 1970 boxed set, which is now out of print. On Stooges, it's basically alternate mixes and extended versions, while on Fun House it's primarily outtakes, but given the volatility of the material on that album, there's quite a bit of variation from version to version. That said, none of the out-takes are particularly revelatory outside a twisted, distended, sax-soaked version of ""1970"", and most casual listeners will probably not spin disc two of either set more than once or twice. Fun House does include two songs that didn't make the album, but it's hard to see where either the ravaged blues of ""Slide (Slidin' the Blues)"" or ""Lost in the Future"" would have fit without destroying the record's momentum. That said, both songs offer a chance to hear more of Mackay's sax playing and give a glimpse toward what the band might have sounded like if a lineup had solidified with him in it. It should go without saying that these are two of the most important signposts on the way to the punk explosion, and that any rock fan with a sense of history owes it to themselves to check them out if they haven't already. What's often lost as we place them in the canon, though, is the fact that both albums sound incredibly good today on their own terms, raw and immediate and dripping with an aggression that's rarely been rivaled.",,8.9,
When We Break,Criteria,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74213d197565213938a/1:1/w_160/e459d089.jpg,2005-08-16 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1815-when-we-break/,Saddle Creek,"Criteria frontman Steve Pedersen has lived the typical American rock n' roll dream-- small-town Nebraska kid joins cult band, splits to form own band, goes to Duke Law School, returns to Omaha to start another band. Okay, so the lawyer part's not the most conventional detour but true to form, Pedersen's a real Atticus Finch on When We Break, the band's second full-length. Rather than blubbering, teen drama-style bellyaching, Pedersen constructs a coherent argument supported by facts and analysis when bitching about his white suburban life. Exhibit A: On opener ""Prevent the World"", the defendant hates being a corporate lawyer in Omaha, and wishes to join rock band: ""I'm stuck in a basement world/ Where even if I try to make rock my living, it wouldn't coincide/ So how do I reconcile the success of life/ With the rational urges?"" Call it sophisticated emo brought to us by ""Law and Order"", but the distinctions between a petulant, disillusioned teen and an argumentative trial attorney can oftentimes merge. At this time, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to direct you to Exhibit B, Mr. Pedersen's impeccably efficient yet busy punk-pop orchestration. Of course, in order to properly analyze this evidence, the court should be familiar with Exhibits C, D and E-- Fugazi, Sparta and Sum-41, respectively. Criteria's sound follows the devolution from Exhibit C to D, flirting with E at its fluffiest, particularly on anthems ""Good Luck"" and ""Ride the Snake"". Further investigation reveals Pedersen's biggest songwriting glitch: Take away the octave riffs and dropped-d power chords, and Criteria suddenly becomes severely handicapped, a weakness the band goes at great lengths to dissemble using jagged math-rock riffs or occasional attempts at crafting ""atmosphere."" Instruments aside, Pederson's filibuster vocals ultimately hamstring When We Break. The guy tries to squeeze a court case's worth of litigiousness into one album, leaving little space to breathe musically. Melodies continuously encroach on each other, colliding before a stable hook can be realized. Thus, we get into an issue where the vocalist places his own beefs, or EMOtions, ahead of the music. Not to go into a semantics/systematics debate over Criteria's classification as ""emo"" versus some delicacy label like ""post-hardcore,"" but the latter term has become the ""Freedom Fries"" doublespeak du jour for defenders of the sound. Saddle Creek tested the threshold for this stuff with Cursive, of which Pedersen was formerly a member, but that group threw in enough fresh ideas to quash, or at least numb, most listeners' prejudices. Sadly, Criteria, if anything, only justifies the emo stigma, and I have about 36 minutes of taped evidence to back that charge.","Steve Pedersen (ex-Cursive) plays efficient yet busy punk-pop on this Saddle Creek release.

Voodoo Man,Electronicat,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce5ea9e61561daa75b0/1:1/w_160/d623b4e3.gif,2005-08-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2894-voodoo-man/,Disko B,"Electronicat: It's one French guy working electro-head backgrounds against old school rock'n'roll action, glam rock sleaze, and general over-the-top freak-out camp. I first heard this stuff at the now-defunct Weekend Records and Soap, which was co-owned by Magas, another electro guy with some rockabilly attitude. As something to walk off the street and into, it didn't sound half bad. The chances, though, of your wanting to bring it home with you? Slim. This, after all, is the sound of someone asking you to delight in the sheer dirty spazz of what he's doing-- an opportunity that nowadays only gets offered to noise acts with enough no-fun attitude to make the whole thing seem like ""art."" Strike two: The sort of camp, yowling rock'n'roll schtick so many horrible American acts fall in love with, the one we should have let drop well before Jon Spencer came around. Electronicat at least has the excuse of being French, which explains why this album contains a brief impersonation of Jerry Lewis instead of Jerry Lee Lewis. His other excuse is the album is kinda fun. Its intentions are made clear by the grotty digital sound, which is basically the electronic equivalent of the four-track in the basement-- this weird laptop reversal where sounding too clean makes the whole thing sound awfully dirty. It's hard to think of a better context for all the just-for-fun old-rock quoting he does on here. When ""Dans la Bois"" kicks off with a psychdelic-Stones pastiche, low-rent French Jagger posing over low-rent guitar and machine stomp, it's not so difficult to get into. Same goes for the rockabilly swing on ""Wap Doowop"" and the fuzzed-out Bo Diddley beat on ""Savage Cat"", if not the modified Deep Purple riff on ""Mummy Cat""; at best, they wind up doing the same thing Junior Senior did to Bob Dylan on one of their album tracks, revving up old tropes into some sleazy drum-machined present. Still, an excuse is an excuse, and there comes the point where you realize you're chuckling at some of his jackaround tracks more than you're actually feeling them. There comes the point where you remember that Stereo Total could do plenty of this pastiche and make it sound a lot sharper, and there comes the point where you remember that you could get better sleazoid camp vibes off of the Cramps. There's some satisfying stomp-and-wail up in her-- and some lovable cut-ups on ""The Smell of Danger"", and some home-recording weirdism that could nearly slot into God Ween Satan-- but it's all going to need to get a lot better-developed if it's every going to fly.","French electro-pop music meets American rockabilly.

Hillulah,Gang Gang Dance,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfffabf31b7dc71563bf/1:1/w_160/1a5c1056.jpg,2005-08-16 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3649-hillulah/,Social Registry,"Initially released as a limited edition CD-R for a November 2004 tour with Animal Collective, this 33-minute collage stitches together four live shows recorded between mid-2003 and early 2004 at the Knitting Factory, North Six, Passerby, and the Cooler (RIP), and includes an additional 30-plus minutes of live video footage. Don't expect Bruce Springsteen's Live 1975-85: Hillulah isn't a straight-up archive. Treating the recordings like found material, drummer Tim Dewitt spliced and shifted hours of two-track audio into these extensions, and like most of GGD's best work, the rhythmic incantations are hermetically removed from the everyday, so cheers and other live-album trappings are minimal. Stylistically, the four pieces phase through and reintroduce sounds contained on each GGD release: broken dub, colorful piano embellishments, blurred calypso, oxygen-deprived hiccups, island wattles, prismatic fractures, Fluxus sutures, earthy drum circles, etc. At one point Lizzy Bougatsos dives into a cavern after engaging in Tourette's syndrome howls with an unspecified male, astride electronic bleeps, drumstick rattles, and guitar blooms. Elsewhere, guest vocalist Sean Reveron of A Gun Called Tension shouts post-punk vitriol alongside boorish implosion. Occasionally, bits of instrumentation are trashed (like a dropped second), offering the feel of a loop (or lope). Percussion accelerates, tapping a constant, techno-friendly palpitation. For genealogy completists, Hillulah glances outside the studio and practice room, suggesting multiple bridges between 2001's Revival of the Shittest, the self-titled Fusetron LP, and God's Money. Personally, I like that it was compiled over just three days, because as one might expect, the transitions are at times sketchy, the movements not entirely in-synch. Looseness is its charm. In that sense, Hillulah supplies imperfect (and pretty) off-the-cuff glances at Gang Gang Dance's past, but realistically speaking, it's a documentation for diehards, not curiosity seekers.","This 33-minute collage stitches together live recordings, and it includes an additional 30-plus minutes of video footage.

I Am Come,Part Chimp,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a15e6ef95969320223/1:1/w_160/d352ab0e.jpg,2005-08-16 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6582-i-am-come/,Rock Action,"I Am Come is the second album from the UK's Part Chimp, and their second for the label formed by Mogwai, Rock Action. The band are certainly prone to slow, ""Part Chimp Fear Satan"" guitar squalls, but where those are emotional crescendos for some bands, they're just interludes between the highlights of I Am Come. ""Bakahatsu"" is the prototypical grinding opener. Standing squarely under Mogwai's shadow for 90 seconds, it's just buildup for the sludgy sweet tooth of album peak ""War Machine"". Ringing guitars march forward despite being interrupted by a distorted gallop every four bars, with a melody and rhythm no less effective for their simplicity. Volume is Part Chimp's primary instrument, and while brief respites like ""Bubbles"" are welcome and needed, quiet moments are the enemy. Clean guitar chords creep quietly past, waiting for the next bomb to fall. Sometimes they're safe for close to an entire song (""Bubbles""), sometimes there's only a few seconds before the next attack (""Bring Back the Sound""). The orderly assault of ""War Machine"" gives way to the steady, relentless hammering of ""Hello Bastards"", after which ""Bubbles"" is a trickle in comparison. By the time the Stooges-nodding ""Punishment Ride"" finishes and ""Bring Back the Ride"" is underway, the fuzz pedals are planting their flag. ""Punishment Ride"" is one of the few songs following the quiet/loud dynamic; most just go from loud to louder. ""Dr. Horse Part Two"" is a solid wall of heavy psychedelia, followed up by the reckless pace of ""Fasto"". The bent notes of the title track sound like support beams breaking under the weight of the song's monolithic blues riffing, and ""30 Billion People"" sounds something like Black Sabbath covering Pavement's ""Two States"", boiling over with layers of distortion and erratic guitar solos. Is it any different than last year's Chart Pimp? Is the loudness louder, is the noise nosier? Well, yes and yes, not to mention tighter songs and the band getting a deeper grasp of their dynamics (meaning the few seconds of calm are more concise and effective). Hard to believe that with a sound that's all about overkill, not one note is wasted. These songs are as tight as any pop groups, just played with ear-splitting volume. I wouldn't call it unpredictable, but I Am Come has slight variety amongst the chaos, anchored by a canny sense of pacing. Add that to the 20-ton hooks of ""War Machine"" and ""Bring Back the Sound"", you've got a noteworthy sophomore record-- and, most importantly, one that rocks.","Pummeling, dynamic guitar rock from Mogwai's label.

Total 6,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a802ea9e61561daa5704/1:1/w_160/a186b2e7.jpg,2005-08-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2021-total-6/,Kompakt,"Recently, I was clicking through a music message board (you know the one), and spotted a thread entitled ""Superpitcher Live In NYC"". Turns out he travelled over from Germany to DJ recently. And the general consensus seems to be that he was good. But we've seen him play better. How jaded we've all become in the last 48 months! In 2001, Kompakt's 10 or so CD releases were barely distributed in the U.S., their roster was a mystery (Michael Mayer? Jürgen Paape? Dettinger??) to anyone not paying close attention to post-Basic Channel German techno, and seeing any of them live in the U.S. (if they even played live) would be akin to catching a baby dinosaur walking down Avenue B at dusk. Some of those CD's weren't even that good! Will anyone stand up to make an argument for the ugly, blurting grooves of the first Schaffelfieber comp? Or the flat, gray Chain Reaction cribbing of Jonas Bering? Of course, now Kompakt is huge: adopted by prog house and big-room trance jocks, hipster shorthand for techno in the 21st century, Mayer and crew regularly touring the planet. They were in Spin for chrissakes! 2001 was when that turn from anonymity to (a kind of) superstardom began, with the release of the Total 3 compilation. A mixture of disarmingly catchy vocal cuts and better-than average-intrumentals, Total 3 married techno and trance maneuvers to the kind of wistful, melancholic, or dark vibes that rock fans gravitate to in electronic music. (Cf. Aphex, Boards of Canada...hell, nearly all of the melodic side of IDM.) By 2002, you could safely call Kompakt one of the most exciting labels in the world. For 12 months they knocked out one epochal record after another, be it artist LPs (Thomas Fehlmann, Closer Musik, Justus Köhncke, Kaito), DJ mixes (Friends, *Immer), or comps (*Total 4). The streak began to slow by 2003 when Total 5 debuted to middling reviews and, following a string of mediocre releases, its best record (Michael Mayer's Fabric 13 mix) wasn't even released on the label. 2004 saw its profile at the highest, with blanket press coverage and major U.S. DJ gigs for the Kompakt all-stars. It was also the label's weakest year on CD, with disappointing artist albums from Michael Mayer and Superpitcher, as well as the bloated, unrealized promise of Kompakt 100. So it is with some natural trepidation that I approach Total 6, a 2xCD (uh-oh) collection of recent singles and exclusives. I grumbled and griped too, began to claim that they were being eclipsed by newer labels like Areal or Get Physical. I mean, obviously the zeitgeist has moved on, right? Microhouse is dead and everyone wants electro-house. Well, today I am a choad, because Total 6 is the best in the series since 3. Kompakt was never really microhouse anyway; leave that to your clicking, popping Perlons and Akufens. If any German house label was ""electro-house"" it was Kompakt. Just listen to Köhncke's ""2 After 909"", Closer Musik's ""You Don't Know Me"", or all those basslines. It's just that while they were electro-house they were a dozen other things besides. Disc one contains all the ""hits,"" from that alternate universe where Justus Köhncke is as big a star as 50 Cent (or at least Marvin Hamlisch). Speaking of which, he and Andreas Dorau's ""Durch Die Nacht (Geiger Mix)"" starts off as typical kozmik synth squiggle nonsense before itchy cocaine guitars, sweeping strings, and a faded vocal from an old record turn it into disco rescued from the Salvation Army. And his ""Krieg"" is fairly pro-forma electro-house, elevated by the trancey synth pad breakdown halfway through that burps and farts into a gurning, unresolved bleep-fest. ""I Built This City"" is probably the track that's received the most press so far, a Michael Mayer remix of a Baxendale (!) track. It opens with percussion that sounds like oil popping off a hot pan and chugging trance synths. The vocal is the most camp the label has ever touched (with some pretty stiff competition). The drums begin to speed up as an electro bassline bullies its way to the front of the mix. It finally bursts into a falsetto that makes Jake Shears sound like Phil Anselmo, designed to cause shirt-stripping amyl-nitrate hysteria on the floor. You will either love it or hate it. Rex the Dog's ""I Look Into Mid-Air"" has thwacking drums and farty, belching glitch-pops, like Mr. Oizo spiked with laxative, before wooshing keyboards arcs it towards the titular location. Tocotronic's ""Pure Vernunft Darf Niemals Siegen (Superpitcher/Wassermann Single Mix)"" feels like a Re-Animator lab mistake of Factory-style gothic indie and chugging house. The vocals veer uncomfortably into near-hysteria, backed by jacking drums, spidery chords, ""A Forest""-like bass, and a desperately strummed guitar. The MFA's ""The Difference It Makes"", on the other hand, is as comforting as if the whole track was trapped in a snow globe, a steady pounding beat with a mercury misting of hi-hat, deep bass, and more trancey builds. Then a plaintive voice begins to repeat the title, so tremulous with reverb that it sounds barely human, chopped into doll parts, before it all drops away and a grinding drone chord clears the way for the beat to kick back in. Disc 2 is less showy, more clubby. Superpitcher's ""Tell Me About It"" drops deliberate, Arvo Part-esque piano clusters into a mid-tempo groove centered on a steady shaker as a female voice and cymbal rushes snake across the stereo field. Michael Mayer and Mattias Aguayo's ""Slow"" is actually a mash-up of Kylie's ""Slow"" (recited by Dieter from ""Sprockets"") with Mayer's ""Lovefood"", that's funny for a spin or two but never really gels. SCSI-9's ""Mini"" is late summer/early fall pressed into grooves, fireflies buzzing in your ears, a deeply dippy bassline, hazy tape loops, and melodies like water tower safety lights blinking on and off. These are of course the ""special"" tracks, the ones which have a little something extra (vocals, samples, weirdness) on top of their grooves. Across an expanse of 160 minutes, there are plenty of tracks working a handful of materials into (slightly) new shapes. Dub echo and reverb. Sparkling one-note melody trails. Buzzing analogue basslines. Clicks, pop, plorts, plurps, and burps. Preset strings and j-j-jacking drums. The more amazing thing is that the bulk of this ""faceless techno bollocks"" is, in complete defiance of most rules about double CD collections, quite good. (But what would a dance record be without a few tracks that confused ""repetitious"" with ""hypnotic."") 2005 has been a healthy, steady year for the label. There have been good-to-great releases from Justus Köhncke, Ferenc, DJ Koze, and Superpitcher, which doesn't even begin to touch on the singles output. (Still the lifeblood of any dance label.) Now, with Total 6 emphatically not sucking, is it safe to say Kompakt is ""back""? It seems a bit crude to apply rock journalism tropes and hype mongering to a label whose stated ambition is to prove that minimal techno is a 4-life thing, who will probably be plugging away long after the media has seemingly lost their contact info. Suffice to say they survived their brush with fame and came out tougher, if not quite so lustrous, something all too few labels can boast after being put under those lamps.","After a series of underwhelming, slightly disappointing releases, Kompakt enjoys a return to form with this 2xCD entry into its Total series.

Another Wound EP,The Ponys,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a176ea9e61561daa47e7/1:1/w_160/5436b123.jpg,2005-08-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6540-another-wound-ep/,Sweet Nothing,"At first blush, the six-song Another Wound EP appears designed to lure back into the tent those garage-punk fans who might've found the Ponys' sophomore album Celebration Castle to be an overly tidied renovation of their 2004 debut Laced With Romance. Containing five older and/or non-LP tracks in addition to Celebration's ""Another Wound"", this EP finds the group foraging through some of their noisiest, most chancy material. But they've managed to do so with their acute melodic edges still fully honed, and consequently it seems doubtful that there's anything on this short, brash collection likely to either alienate the group's established fans or convert the sticklers. With its fortified Bunnymen-meets-Chronic Town jangle, ""Another Wound"" may initially seem an unlikely choice to headline such a punchy little set, but once this addictive lead-off has cruised through a couple effortless verses, its guitars have accumulated enough residual distortion to pack a not inconsiderable bite. Jered Gummere's distanced Richard Hell vocal hysterics remain a distinctly polarizing element throughout these tracks, as he settles his unique adenoidal yowl somewhere outside of both standardized punk affectations and conventional pop-weighted patterns. His approach serves the Ponys well on their buzzed, surprisingly muscular cover of the Descendents' ""Good, Good Things"", an uninventive but nevertheless winning joiner that indicates the band can still pound out a waterproof garage anthem with effortless aplomb. One might expect more of the same from the quaint ""I Wanna Fuck You"", which instead proves to be exactly the type of artful guitar-pop that would've made another good neighbor on Celebration Castle, with or without the chorus' casual swears. This cut does, however, contain a brief, torrential Flip Your Wig guitar solo as markedly dissonant as any the Ponys have yet featured. An alternate stripe of dissonance appears in the oddball clip-clop rhythms of ""Prosthetic Head"", a woozy shuffle filled with drippy underwater keyboard effects, trebly guitars and echo-laden vocals, with Gummere skating this uneven surface while fussily complaining about getting strangled with a telephone cord. The performance reveals in the band a welcome streak of eccentricity, one that provides for a sympathetic segue into the near-grunge of ""How Does It Taste"", a track which occasionally swerves within a chin-hair of Nirvana's ""All Apologies"". Somewhat strangely, this short collection closes with a rather anti-climactic reprise of Laced With Romance's ""Looking Out a Mirror"". A propulsive mélange of skronky guitars and beach party organ, the song contains what is still one of the Ponys' most impressive pop hooks, but its presence here does little to reassure listeners who're anxious to learn whether the group's most exciting work lies before them or behind them.","Six-song EP contains five older and/or non-LP tracks in addition to Celebration Castle's ""Another Wound"", and on the whole is heavier than their most recent album.

Aw Come Aw Wry,Phosphorescent,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a413d1975652138699/1:1/w_160/61525307.jpg,2005-08-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6584-aw-come-aw-wry/,Misra,"Phosphorescent's lone member Matthew Houck plays the kind of glacially paced, eccentrically orchestrated, lyrically oblique songs that some people call ""beautiful"" and others call ""boring."" It's hard to deny the claims of the latter: Houck's second full-length, Aw Come Aw Wry, has its dry stretches, longueurs that add to the album's atmosphere but don't really go anywhere. But it's equally difficult to dismiss songs like ""Joe Tex, These Taming Blues"", which summons the great soul singer in conjunction with a metaphor about wild and domesticated animals. At its frequent best, Aw Come Aw Wry successfully fuses indie Americana atmospherics with gospel and country melodies to achieve a striking and esoteric sound. Punctuated throughout by horns that sound like Stax hits by way of In An Aeroplane Over the Sea (the all-too-obvious, but completely un-ignorable, comparison), Aw Come Aw Wry is loosely organized around three short versions of the title track, each one interpreted differently. ""Aw Come Aw Wry #5"" and ""#3"" have slow tempos, soft, enveloping sounds, and dripping pedal steel that might be called bootgazer, and the slightly more animated ""#6"" joins an elementary drumbeat (that is quite possibly the same one from the Homestar Runner theme) to a gospel clap-along. The title tracks act like title cards on the album, and from them Houck derives the sounds and themes that color the more traditional tracks. The pots-and-pans percussion and strangled guitar riff of ""I Am a Full Grown Man (I Will Lay in the Grass All Day)"" are introduced one track earlier in ""Aw Come Aw Wry #6"", and the patient momentum of ""Joe Tex, These Taming Blues"" is initiated in ""#5"". Their shared mournful melody-- four descending notes: the first long, the rest short-- even appears on ""Lost Name"", with its possessed legion of speaking voices. The function of these interstitials is as practical as it is aesthetic: they not only give Aw Come Aw Wry its shape, but hold the album together even when it begins to drag towards the end on two versions of ""Endless"" (not to mention the 19 minutes of road and thunder noise that closes the album, as if to prove some sort of backporch authenticity). As a result, the songs sound of a piece, suffused with a wobbly, warbly regret that makes each one sound like a head-hanging apology to a particular someone. In fact, ""South (of America)"", with its cinematic chorale of backing voices and its pledge of self-imposed exile, fashions a refrain from a wounded mea culpa: ""Babe, I'm sorry/ I'm sorry/ I am"", Houck sings, as if slowly backing away. It helps that he delivers these songs in a wounded voice that sounds like a dried cornhusk, papery thin and crackling. His odd phrasing suggests a rougher Eef Barzalay, and at times his voice sounds too weak for the material, but that distance between Houck's vocal capacity and the demands of ""Not a Heel"" and ""Dead Heart"" only reinforces the impact of the performance, as if he's trying to express something too large for the music.","Matthew Houck's sophomore album is packed with glacially paced, eccentrically orchestrated, and lyrically oblique songs.

Field Music,Field Music,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beb9abf31b7dc71561bb/1:1/w_160/9974b47c.jpg,2005-08-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3344-field-music/,Memphis Industries,"By now, the beaches of Sunderland, England, must be redolent with post-punk herky-jerky. To be sure, native sons Field Music have much in common with the Mackems that came before-- not least their members, who include one former Futurehead plus a current Maxïmo Park drummer-- but rather than assail us with angularity, the region's latest exports aptly prefer prettiness. Indeed, ""You're So Pretty"", their 12-song, 38-minute debut's art-pop finale, is the album's best track, and also its buzzing, ornamented, just-too-brief-enough synecdoche. That song, like the album's other epiphanies, is a sparkling construct of whirring guitars, eccentric percussion, windmill-tilting bass, and Andrew Moore's piano embellishments. Dual lead vocalists Peter and David Brewis swap quixotic, often-falsetto harmonies as indebted to Pet Sounds as to ""Hounds of Love"". The lyrics tend toward the commonplace, which if not beside the point pretty much is the point: ""You're so pretty/ I could talk to you all night"", chime the Brothers Brewis, their sweet-nothings granted the wings of soaring melody. Second single ""You Can Decide"" is the band's most immediately compelling track, with copious oohing, spastic handclaps, and eloquently stuttering chorus: ""So if you know, you know, you know/ Let me."" ""Got to Write a Letter"" benefits from slippery acoustic guitars and fairly sharp wordplay, though none as adroit as ""I've given up thinking"" from the album's rare sad song, the still-sun-dappled ""Like When You Meet Someone Else"". Opener ""If Only the Moon Were Up"" introduces a smattering of Revolver horn oompahs and GeoHa guitarisms ca. Abbey Road. I still say stupendous first single ""Shorter Shorter"" was, true to its name, the latter album's flip-side shortened, haunted and harried by imminent mortality. Meanwhile, the band's self-consciously complex, maximalist arrangements and Sparks- or even Yes-like vocal heights call up that suddenly-not-dirty (if prefixed with ""hyper"") word: prog. I'm just saying. After their first two singles, it's hard not to be let down by good-enoughs like the ambitious, briefly cacophonous ""Tell Me Keep Me"", string-laden ""Luck Is a Fine Thing"", and staccato, saxophone-blearing ""17"". More ephemeral than Clor, more cerebral than the Rakes, Field Music has, like the Magic Numbers, fashioned a distinctive voice and near-perfect arrangements, but the songs hint at greatness nearly as often as they achieve it. Pretty is pretty nice, but the promise of true beauty makes tough critics of us all.","Sunderland band shares a family tree with Futureheads and Maxïmo Park but plays buzzing indie pop rather than herky-jerky post-punk.

No Flashlight,Mount Eerie,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c55eeb335119a49ed9be/1:1/w_160/f6f1320f.gif,2005-08-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5596-no-flashlight/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"No Flashlight, Mount Eerie's first studio album, comes with a huge poster/map/Farmer's Almanac thing, which is meant to help explain the music and look pretty doing so. It isn't the first time Phil Elverum, the band's inscrutable leader, has written an album with grandiose narrative threads and laid them out in liner notes. Mount Eerie, his last record as Microphones, tackled-- in language that was difficult despite its puerile concision-- the Sun, Solar System, and Universe, plus ol' Mount Eerie herself. But while that record came with an attractive but relatively modest fold-out poster (all black ink printed on diaphanous wax paper), No Flashlight's visual companion is a freaking atlas, complete with beatific photographs and Elverum's wobbly prose. Window-dressing on an epic scale, its inclusion sends the message that understanding is required to access enjoyment. No Flashlight is the most musically undistinguished Elverum-related project to date, including Microphones' intractable early albums and Mount Eerie's shoddily-recorded live and tour-only material. The album's laissez-faire production fails to anchor its quaint, melody-allergic songs. In turn, Elverum's retiring vocals float to the top, which is a horrible place for them. It's a textural trainwreck that sabotages the music before one can even focus on lyrics or guitar lines. So the distraction of an expository outpouring makes sense. Demanding listener input-- as Elverum does here by not-so-subtly inviting us to ponder him-- isn't a bad thing. But courting ears with such esoteric hooey is disingenuous and annoying. Elverum used to be able to hide his most solipsistic moments behind ambitious music; he now makes boring music that is premised on his persona and the explanation thereof. This is theoretical music in a whole 'nother sense: Largely untechnical and musically staid, the meaning lies not in the notes, not in the colossal liner spread, and not even really in the words, which are feebly expository and largely unsatisfying. The value, we are led to believe, lies somewhere apart from the music. Elverum sings in an quietly anguished voice-- like a cult leader, it's only as powerful as what he puts behind it. Here, Elverum's a lone sojourner; Mount Eerie's gray performances put the diffident singer cruelly in the foreground, where he founders. Has his voice changed? Hardly. Coy, lethargic, and almost drunkenly tuneless, this is the same guy from Microphones. Only now he has nowhere to hide. On ""The Glow,"" pt. 2, his former band's penultimate and best album, Elverum wrapped inner-sanctum ruminations in warm, whooshing instrumentals, rich in assertive melodies. No Flashlight is comparatively ascetic. Melodies are sparse but the music isn't quite minimal. Opener ""I Know No One"" subdues a plaintive guitar line in accordion swell and excessive, frequently mic-clipping percussion. Unaccessorized, the six-string would sound brilliant-- a counterpoint to Elverum's ugly-beautiful vox-- but the line is swallowed up. On ""How?"", notes cluster in disorganized spurts, while the 1st Mt. Eerie Tabernacle Hummers fill the voids with their closed-lip sounds. ""Stop Singing"" opens beautifully-- flashes of guitar tussle with clarinet vapors, evoking an unlikely forebear: Talk Talk. But it's just an intro, soon to be supplanted by a bass/drums vamp that dispenses with lo-fi's anchoring warmth, keeping the shabbiness. Elverum previously espoused a very un-singer/songwriterly preference for sound over persona. But No Flashlight is quick to dispel any confusion around its focus. ""I Know No One"" drops the mission statement bombshell: ""Knowing no one understands these songs/ I try to sing them clearer/ Even though no one has ever asked, 'What does Mount Eerie mean?'"". The best tracks are those on which he's mollified: by Glow-sized guitar wash and skittish drums on ""The Moan"", or gusty tuba and a second-line beat on ""The Universe Is Shown"". I revisited my Microphones LPs, which I haven't spun regularly for a couple years, to see if evolving tastes, globalization, or something else isn't to blame for my indifference to Mount Eerie. Verdict? ""The Glow,"" pt. 2 is still fantastic; It Was Hot We Stayed in the Water still very good; and Mt. Eerie still trippy as hell. If the forthcoming Singers is any indication, Mount Eerie got some moxy in 'em yet. But your enjoyment of No Flashlight will depend on your interest in Phil Elverum, and whether or not you've the patience to wade through this sonic tub-full of Jonestown juice. Once you find him, he's just as fetchingly impossible. But when the pleasure is this conditional, it becomes fuzzy what all the fuss is over.","Mount Eerie's first studio album features a laissez-faire production that allows former Microphones leader Phil Elverum's vocals to float to the top of the mix.

Out of Tune,Geiger,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a195b1335d7bf16982ca/1:1/w_160/7b4e2f16.jpg,2005-08-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3678-out-of-tune/,Firm,"It's not what you'd expect-- not from a star remixer for the Kompakt label, not from a close associate of Schaeben and Voss, and maybe not even from the man behind the terrific ""Cocain-E"" 12-inch. That track, after all, was tight: Chunky-funky drums, hot'n'slippery discoid bass, and one long lascivious whisper of a vocal. The spangly acoustic guitar and unselfconscious cheese-out solo might have made it sound like Phoenix-- except Phoenix are always asking you to get on the dance floor and smile and be happy, whereas Geiger seemed to be asking you to come join him in the men's room for a couple minutes. He sounds like he's asking the same question on this album, sure. But strings of mediocre tracks and wild stylistic shifts-- two things that just don't sit well together-- make you want to tell him you'll meet him in there in five minutes, and then run out to look for a cab. For one thing, the guy's got a terrible opening line, something only notches above carrying a comedy ""Booty Inspector"" badge. ""Hot Body"" is five-plus minutes of nicely formed but entirely unremarkable house tick, background music for a weirdly boring lounge, layered with an interview from some web-porn woman; it's almost as if he realized the first four minutes weren't very interesting, and fired up his web browser to find some bit of audio that might distract you. So you try to brush him off, but he comes back with stronger material: ""Bless the Lord"" has some wonderfully sweaty slow burn, and it showcases Geiger's stoned-seducer voice better than anything else on here. After that one, you might even be willing to tell him your real name-- only then he gets cocky and offers you an ""Interlude"". And here you were, hoping ""Hot Body"" was meant to be the throwaway intro. Here you were, too, thinking Geiger might play to his slick-funk strengths. ""Sunday"" revs them up into a decent rocker, running from disco verse to fuzzed-out chorus like a kitsch-less version of Electric Six's ""Danger! High Voltage""-- (okay, my name's Nitsuh, you're Geiger? Alex Geiger?)-- but then suddenly ""Love Song"" is some horribly dippy acoustic folk, with a complete mess of a pseudo-psychedelic interlude. Who is this guy, anyway? Oh, you'll never know; the swift recovery on ""Cocain-E"" isn't going to carry you through. There's something nice in the way ""Five Years"" moves from the old sweaty groove to interludes that are basically indie-rock drama, and ""Studio Star"" is half-good at spreading Cheez-Whizz funk over itself, Alan Braxe-style. But there's just nothing here that's got much of a shot at grabbing you-- just ongoing slow-house strut and lascivious vocal and the strange sense that you're listening to the collected outtakes and demos from some much-better record. Plus another painful folk number. About animals. Something to sing when, 30 minutes later, he comes out of the restroom looking for you and finds that you're long gone.","Unexpected release from the star remixer and creator of the terrific ""Cocain-E"" 12-inch.

Resilience,Kid606,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb87eb335119a49eca64/1:1/w_160/fc47935d.jpg,2005-08-14 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4411-resilience/,Tigerbeat6,"Every few records Miguel Depedro of Kid606 steps away from loose and casual no-jacket-required IDM and changes his tone, addressing his audience with an implied ""But seriously..."" These weightier releases typically feature nakedly emotional titles: P.S. I Love You, The Soccergirl EP, ""Sometimes"", ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away It Would Be Looking For The Day When Right Beside You It Could Forever Stay"". I've always found these records charming, as they convincingly render the dull romantic ache of a young artist who spends way too much time alone in front of his computer. Because of who Kid606 is and what we know of his obsessions, there's a hint that perhaps technology has become an impediment to love. Resilience is the latest in this line, and here Kid606 really puts himself in an artistically vulnerable place, dedicating the record to his mom, putting a photo of a young child on the cover (looks like Depedro at age three), and proclaiming that he ""didn't want to die without releasing Resilience."" More than most of his peers, Kid606 understands that weird music without fixed emotional signposts can be shaped by titles and presentation. The unabashedly personal nature of Resilience is supposed to make the music heavier and more resonant, I guess, but something feels off. Ultimately the directness with which Depedro addresses his audience is positive, adding a goofy humanity to his machine music, but the undercurrent of manipulation around Resilience is initially repellent. Which would of course be easily forgivable as long as the music is good. Resilience is quite different from earlier Kid606 forays into ambient, mostly in that it's not really ambient at all. It is instead a stab at an electronic pop album, with chords, melodies and band-like arrangements. From there Kid606 feels from to wander, from dark new wave in the tradition of Gary Numan (""Done With the Scene"" and ""Sugercoated"") to bubbly reggae (""Phoenix Riddim"" and ""Hold it Together""). The textures are not novel and are not supposed to be, so a record like this is going to live or die on the basis of its tunes. A few make it for sure. ""I Miss You"" has a synth patch that sounds like Joe Zawinul's electric piano from Cannonball Adderly's ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" and Kid606 goes to church with it, piecing together a simply melody oozing with uplift. ""Banana Peel"" is robotic dub with a real sense of swing that slowly builds its infectious hook over its length, so that when it finally comes together at the end the tension is released toward the sky. And ""King of Harm"" is a slight step down but still enjoyable, convincing pastoral nostalgia dented in an interesting way by metallic percussion. If everything here were on par with these three tracks, Kid606 would have something, but the bulk of Resilience consists of indistinct mid-tempo beats and a lot vague loops that don't go anywhere. During certain stretches the music has an oddly narcotic effect, tapping into that distracted alpha state that comes from listening to too many middling records from Morr. That these inoffensively dull tracks are collected as a Big Statement, something the artist has longed to get off his chest, is a little depressing-- and not in a good way.","Frequent sonic prankster steps away from no-jacket-required IDM on his latest LP.

Giving Up the Ghost,Windsor for the Derby,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa2b1335d7bf16996d6/1:1/w_160/da72d6a1.jpg,2005-08-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8784-giving-up-the-ghost/,Secretly Canadian,"Windsor for the Derby has seen its fair share of changes over the years. The group formed in Tampa, where the core duo of Dan Matz and Jason McNeely were joined by drummer Greg Anderson. Since that time, the band grew to a four-piece, then shrank again to just Matz and McNeely, and those two have moved all over the country, with McNeely residing in Austin, Texas, and Matz calling various East Coast cities home. In summer 2004, however, the two both moved to Philadelphia. As a result, Giving up the Ghost is an anomaly in the band's catalogue. Instead of being forced to get together semi-annually to share ideas and record, WFTD were able to record in their home studio, creating an album that is more fluid than past efforts, yet retains the band's characteristic disconnected feel. Windsor for the Derby's music has always been a bit of a mish-mash. Long instrumentals borrowed from post-rock sidle up next to folk-tinged pop songs; jarring, discordant guitar lines ramble over subdued electronics. And although Ghost doesn't really break from that mold, it finds the band moving further into the quiet, low-key ambience they've been flirting with on the last couple of discs. Most of the songs feature solemn, at times almost whispered, vocals, with several songs employing haunting, catchy hooks. ""Empathy for People Unknown"" uses layered vocals and droning keyboards to create the hollow atmosphere that permeates the disc. Elsewhere, the band flirts with new wave on ""Praise"" and post-punk on ""Gathering""; both fine examples of their knack for taking on a variety of styles while still sounding distinctive. In fact, that dichotomy, that ability to at once sound fresh and conventional, has always been on of WFTD's greatest assets. Perhaps it's a result of Matz and McNeely building their musical relationship from different parts of the country. The strongest number here is ""Giving Up"", a dark, wistful ballad that begins with strained vocals and acoustic guitar that slowly lead into a somber, repetitive middle section, building to the refrain, ""It's probable/ Things fall apart."" It's the sort of tune that could change Natalie Portman's life in Garden State II. There are only two instrumentals: Opener ""Dirge for a Pack of Lies"" and ""The Front"". The former features an odd, minimalist beat accented by what sounds like an accordion, while the latter is the closest thing here to post-rock, with swirling echoes of keys, guitar harmonics, and other muffled ambient noise surrounding plaintive acoustic guitar strumming. With the addition of Anna Neighbor and Charlie Hall to the line-up, Windsor for the Derby has once again branched into full-band status. The fact that this line-up has been frequently performing live only strengthens the cohesiveness of Giving up the Ghost, which may stand as the band's most focused disc to date.","Post-rock mixed with folk-tinged pop and jarring, discordant guitar lines over subdued electronics.

Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101,Jeezy,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab239d034d5c69bf3f88/1:1/w_160/bea31a71.jpg,2005-08-14 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8916-lets-get-it-thug-motivation-101/,Def Jam,"Young Jeezy's proper debut has been a long time coming, though it's been a treat hearing his weathered, weezy rasp on mixtapes (most notably DJ Drama's Trap or Die). He is a conduit between the South, where most of today's commercially lucrative hip-hop originates, and a lagging East Coast scene. Let's Get It is not the best rap album of the year and Jeezy is hardly the world's greatest lyricist. But he slings a sometimes-creepy, sometimes-clever, sometimes-chaotic charisma and he rides that magnetism to a mostly brilliant solo entrance to the bigs. On opener ""Thug Motivation 101"" Jeezy pounds his chest and growls, ""I used to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches er'where/ Now I hit the kitchen lights, there's marble floors er'where"" over tense, eerie keyboards. It's a joyous moment but also the scariest album opener I've heard this year. He breathes hard on the track and stares down his microphone like it hates him. He punctuates the song with his calling card. By now Da Snowman's ad-libs are things of legend. Unbridled ""Daaaayuums"" and everlasting ""Yeeeeaaahs"" or ""Thaaaaat's riiiiight""s punctuate each song. For most MCs this would weigh down their words. For Jeezy, it's the essence of his persona: maniacal shouting, catchphrases, euphoria, instant gratification. There's no parsing through flow and lyrics and drum machines. He hits hard and quickly. ""My Hood"", while cheap, easy, and out of character for the steadily mean-mugged Jeezy, is blissful, thanks to a chintzy Casio beat and some sort of My Hood=Our Hood claptrap. ""Get Ya Mind Right"" runs on horror movie organ fuel, like a Goblin-Argento soundtrack redux. ""And Then What"" finds Mannie Fresh in fine, fat-faced form while Jeezy heads down to his ""Auntie House"" before he goes boom, boom clap. ""Go Crazy"" is the height of the Mason-Dixon bridge. It is also the best 1998 Roc-A-Fella drug rap song in some time, featuring producer Don Cannon's spare tom rolls, classy horns and a killer chorus. A recent remix featuring New York kings Jay-Z and Fat Joe was one of the more obvious (and thrilling) things to happen to hip-hop in recent months and confims Jeezy's universality. All the fun shit aside, at 19 tracks and no skits, Let's Get It is long and can become a chore to wade through. Barring the Bun B-assisted classic ""Trap or Die"" and the soul-jockeying ""Talk to Em"" the album's second half really lags and Jeezy's allure ultimately wears. Why more artists don't follow the Illmatic code remains a mystery. We buy mixtapes for a reason, dudes.","Mixtape mainstay issues his proper debut; it serves as a conduit between the commercially lucrative South and a lagging East Coast scene.

Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg,Wooden Wand,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aab013d1975652139aa7/1:1/w_160/7d691538.jpg,2005-08-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8798-harem-of-the-sundrum-and-the-witness-figg/,Soft AbuseTime-Lag,"At the local record store, the freak-folk section's gridlocked. It's a fucking epidemic. Since Devendra Banhart shepherded his golden apples onto one collection, indie rockers have had time to grow-out their hair/grizzled beards and practice some Vashti Bunyan/John Fahey tablature. So, unless you have a desire to purchase everything even vaguely arboreal or finger-picky, separating the raw and the cooked can be difficult. A fresh breeze from Knoxville, Tennessee (for the time being, he says), James Toth aka Wooden Wand plays somber folk with smoky, chicken-coop ambiance. Sticking with the basics, his unadorned sound consists of guitar and voice: Singing into your ear, he whispers and caws over splintery strums. Now and again, his voice lifts like a hillbilly choir or a candlelit revival presided over by David Crosby. He mumbles. He exorcises and laments. He goes Bill Callahan on us. Hardly a naive backwoodsman, ex-Golden Calves player Toth is the leader of upstart Brooklyn (and elsewhere) free-folk vagabonds, the Vanishing Voice. He also co-operates Polyamory Records with fellow ex-Calve and current-Dead Machines tone bender Tovah O'Rourke, wife of Wolf Eyes' John Olson. Regardless of Toth's experimental pedigree, Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg runs in a different direction than his all-over-the-map work with the Vanishing Voice (though you can hear hints of their thing in the opening flange-fest of loopy ""Warn Winch, Pts. 2-3""). That's the surprise and joy of this record: Not just adept at improvisation, Toth proves a strong, subtle songwriter. The self-released cassette Harem of the Sundrum appeared last year, but this is a longer, fuller set. Toth sites inspiration as Grace Slick, Gene Clark, Fleetwood Mac, and John Phillips, but if you want it in laid out in zeitgeist terms, it's way less quirky than Banhart, could be compared to Wovenhand doing some California, blue-sky dreaming. It snaps and crackles: Once in a good while, he has a strange Tom Petty pronunciation and conjures Bastard Generals, but play it safe and drop lo-fidelity Roky Erickson. The pieces establish a doleful sort of inspiration. ""Leave Your Perch..."" is a downer with soft, Grateful Dead guitar noodles bobbing over icy, shadowy strum and phaser humming like a firefly. ""Perch Modifier"" explicitly states some of the album's religious themes (God, angels, a bird singing ""weak, rejoice, the day is new"") and Toth's connection to landscape: ""Look up to the clouds/ Do you ever look past your boots and onto the ground?/ Do you ever think back to when you were very small?/ That's when you didn't need to rule over all."" The vocals double for the last line and the guitar pickings grow intricate, briefly, as if his heart's a-flutter. A moderately upbeat spiritual, ""Vengeance, Pt. 2"" speaks of end times (Toth is sure he'll see all his friends and so he has ""nothing to fear"") and includes lovely barroom harmonizing for the curious, catchy line: ""Play your phonograph, it still makes baby laugh."" ""Sundrum Ladies"" feels like Stranger Than Paradise scored by M. Ward, focusing on the Louisiana sky, more babies, and some ragged, jittery (but hushed) soloing. Reminiscent of Pink Mountaintops' truck-stop lite-rock blues, ""(Ask a) Sufist Chef"" imbibes in dancing skeletons, a blind magician (""he mistook a lizard for a rabbit and scared the children senseless""), and various ""miraculous things."" It ends with the refrain: ""We should be with God without attachment."" Toth acts move-to-the-country Smog circa Julius Caesar on ""Spiritual Inmate"" and rolls into wood-panelling falsetto on ""Eagle Claw"", where things grow ominous over the chilled Nashville skyline: ""Don't let your time pass you by.../ Don't save your last words 'til you die."" But, weirdly, the song actually sparkles. These lo-fi hymns succeed because they're highly listenable. The collecton's direct, unadorned, honest, idiosyncratic. Like neo-folk's most interesting players (Banhart, Ben Chasny, Joanna Newsom), Toth sounds more like his precursors than his contemporaries, and very much like himself. Timeless is a tough (even questionable) word to plunk down on the present, but all things considered (and considered carefully), Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg should sound especially singular this time next year, even if Toth goes and gets himself a buzz cut.","James Toth's somber, unadorned sound and smoky, chicken-coop ambiance breathes new life into the crowded freak-folk field.

Oboroed / Circus Lives,Terrestrial Tones,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8969d034d5c69bf3aa5/1:1/w_160/39c24e9a.gif,2005-08-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11854-oboroedcircus-lives/,UUAR,"One of the most interesting side effects of the prevalence of mp3s and file-sharing is the way these streamlined modes of distribution have better enabled artists, particularly those of the improv-based underground, to become as absolutely hyper-productive as they dare to be. Experimental acts ranging from freeform tribes like Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice to electronic terrorists like Dead Machines or Hive Mind have managed to become almost ridiculously prolific, carpet-bombing the landscape with one EP, tour-only cassette, or home-burned CD-R after another. And though typically released in modest quantities on a bevy of homemade micro-labels-- occasionally pressed in absurdly limited runs as small as 30 or 40 copies-- these rare crackled eggs always seem to eventually find their way to the internet, helping the groups to build brand-recognition via word-of-mouth if only through their sheer abundance of material. But while such steady, relentless output allows indiscriminate fans to live with a perpetual embarrassment of riches, it's also meant that too often quality control has been kicked to the curbside, as artists begin to place less importance on each individual recording, instead emphasizing their overall, ever-expanding body of work. This tendency towards continuous production has now seemingly become so pervasive that, as evidenced by the Terrestrial Tones' Oboroed / Circus Lives, it has begun to govern side projects as well. Terrestrial Tones is a duo consisting of Dave ""Avey Tare"" Porter and Eric Copeland of, respectively, Animal Collective and Black Dice, two groups who've certainly never permitted cobwebs to settle on their discographies. Oboroed / Circus Lives follows the duo's debut album Blasted by a matter of months, and provides another, more potent dose of the twosome's burbling, minimalist electronic emissions. Though titled and configured as if it's intended to be considered a single, the two-track Oboroed / Circus Lives contains well over 40 minutes of music and certainly requires the same listener commitment as a full album. Both pieces are loosely-assembled, home-recorded collages of processed samples, tape loops and inscrutable electronic ephemera, constructed with the same disheveled DIY charm as the abstractions on their debut. Here, however, the extended running time of each track has given the duo the necessary headroom for their unflappable, languid repetitions to truly hold sway. Heard under the right circumstances, the shifting waves of the opening ""Oboroed"" can be as richly enveloping as a warm cloud of honey-scented smoke, its unhurried progressions calling to mind some of the more tranquil stretches of the Mille Plateaux back catalog. But the track's weave is so fragile that it threatens to disintegrate under close scrutiny, and when heard in the wrong mood its static, recurring loops of clipped laughter and processed chirping can quickly become as grating as intermittent wipers raking across a dry windshield. Less finicky is the follow-up/flipside ""Circus Lives"". With its noisier, coarser features, this slightly shorter cut demands (and rewards) more rapt attention. The track opens with a series of agitated sci-fi effects, homely robot tones that later segue into what sounds like the malfunctioning calliope of a downtrodden circus. Towards song's end, the curtain is lifted suddenly to reveal Porter and Copeland in their street clothes, their hands clutching at puppet strings as the tune marches away on a pulse of cheap keyboards and distorted vocals. As with Blasted, one needs to strain a bit to hear much evidence of the musicians' other bands at work in Terrestrial Tones, though fans of Black Dice's Creature Comforts might occasionally catch a familiar scent on the wind. And as with their debut, one can't help but leave with the feeling that Oboroed / Circus Lives could've withstood a vigorous revision or two, as well as with the realization that there's nothing to prevent these guys from releasing another couple records just like it before the year is out.","Second album in a matter of months from Animal Collective's Avey Tare and Black Dice's Eric Copeland.

Young Dangerous Heart,Subtitle,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ba9d034d5c69bf35e8/1:1/w_160/9259bde5.jpg,2005-08-11 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7826-young-dangerous-heart/,GSL,"Regardless of its merits and flaws, Subtitle's full-length debut confirms the arrival of a rap innovator in the tradition of Kool Keith, MF Doom, Doseone, and Missy Elliott; naturally, attempts to pigeonhole him end in futility. After crewing L.A.'s underground rap scene with Project Blowed and others, he's breaking out on the predominantly no-wave indie Gold Standard Labs, big-upping Pink & Brown and the Mars Volta. Sub's an emo-rapper at heart (pun intended-- check the Oberstian chorus on the title track: ""Young dangerous heart/ Just to let you know I'm not done with you/ Even though you may have a hole in you""), but he embodies his vulnerable human sentiments in a sputtering glitch-hop that epitomizes cold technological precision. These contradictions congeal into a music that's unmistakably Subtitle's own, so when he brags about his innovator-status, the bluster is earned. With dense cyber-babble, Subtitle builds his lexicon from the ground up, and while a few weak MCs get served and a couple sketchy corners held down, gun-talk, crime-thought, and materialistic tropes are largely absent. Instead, we get human holograms, quarter inch jacks, hydrofoil travel, pixilated portraits, Gigapets, software upgrades, .jpeg files, schematics, optic cables, firewalls, motherboards, and C++. When Sub talks about being ""out to rip charts apart"" on ""Con-Contrived (I'm Not)"", we assume he means wiring diagrams, not Billboard. Threats of violence appear as musical, not physical warnings (""Give me an 8-bit machine, I'll take out your whole crew""), and Sub seems more worried about getting nerve-gassed on the train (getting paranoid over the squelchy bass of ""Subtalk"") than getting carjacked on the Ave. But like most MCs of note, what Subtitle says is less important than how he says it, and here, he's the MC-as-hypnotist, his voice as mesmeric as a spinning pocket watch. He splits the difference between Del's monotonous lilt (Deltron 3030 is this album's closest antecedent) and Gift of Gab's tripping, alliterative flow, and if this rap shit doesn't pan out, he could always fall back on recording vocal samples for Speak & Spell. Driving home his ghost-in-the-machine aesthetic, Subtitle spends more time breast-stroking through his beats than rapping over them, and liberally applies that strobe effect that makes his voice sound like a Dntel production. Fleshing out a handful of self-produced tracks, Alias drops a typically ethereal beat on ""Gio-graph-ick""; Lab Waste partner Adlib sears, slithers and glides on the title track and ""Cray Crazy"" (a standout featuring perfectly assimilated cameos from Busdriver, No Can Do, and Aceyalone); Octavius catches spooky wreck on ""Killer Drones on Street"". Sonic density is paramount-- it's not Dälek dense; you can make out the components, more like King Geedorah ""No Snakes Alive"" dense, and often just as unhinged. The album falters over its own bloat (17 tracks) when it forgets about thickness, notably on the going-nowhere bass skeletons of the Subtitle-produced ""Palm Fronds"" and ""Where To?"", but Sub shows promise as a beat auteur on the faltering electro dirge ""Springtime in Rufferdam"" and the nearly grime-caliber sinew of ""Serial Boxes"". If rap's future is tending toward simplicity, this is the Jetsons version, all flying bubble cars and robot maids.","L.A.-based emcee unveils his debut album, with help from Murs, Busdriver, and others.

A Love Obscene,Icky Boyfriends,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a95e6ef959693229fd/1:1/w_160/b3688c6e.jpg,2005-08-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4165-a-love-obscene/,Menlo Park,"Icky Boyfriends are an affront to the goodness of good taste and a challenge to the decency of all decent people. They're a flaming pile of rubber dog shit fulminating on the front porch, and our instinct is to put it out, turn it off, shout ""get off the fucking stage!"" as exasperated Mudhoney fans supposedly demanded during a characteristically Icky opening set. But then, with the crowd thinned out and gag reflexes successfully repressed, the early-90s San Francisco noisefuck trio's perverse, incongruously vulnerable charm reveals itself like the too-familiar special sauce in your fish taco. Overdue 61-track retrospective A Love Obscene compiles the Ickies' two albums plus assorted shits/giggles, all otherwise out of print. With amateurishness to spare, Afro'd frontman Jon Swift supervises start-stop, off-key ruminations on spermicidal jelly (""nothing kills passion quicker than a mouthful""), environmental paranoia (""there's fuck-all you can really do""), and New Kids on the Block (with Donnie impressions!). Swift is equally unstinting in his praise, typically reserved for Mission burritos, dental dams, and a woman named Kate (""it must be 'cause your name isn't Katharine, Kathy, Kathleen... Catwoman... Keith Richards...""). Guitarist Shea Bond flails at nursery-rhyme riffs beneath hideous vacuum-cleaner distortion, while drummer Anthony Bedard sloppily rehearses ""Wipe Out"". Tape hiss guests. What separates Icky Boyfriends from joke-punks like Circle Jerks or Dwarves-- aside from admittedly ""no-fidelity"" recording-- is a scared-stupid sincerity akin to Modern Lovers. ""Nervous Guy"" is the guard-down naïf-rock Rosetta Stone placing the other songs in proper context. ""Maybe we'll be somewhere eating spaghetti/ And you won't even mind if I spill some of your tea"", Swift muses, practically blushing. The awkward tenderness of ""Nervous Guy"" and ""Our Love Song"" helps the Ickies get away with blasphemies: the title of the collection, say, or a typically tuneless, yet affecting, take on John Lennon's ""Love"". Admiring giggles further absolve them of ripping off the Kinks' ""She's Got Everything"" in an ode to masochism (""Toenails"") and the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"" for abortion-clinic jokes (""Closet""). Inevitably, A Love Obscene contains an imperfection or two (the Icky metal of ""Sycamore St."", the ""Hotel California"" bonus track). Yes, the Ickies' world is self-indulgent and masturbatory. Nevertheless, their sound is a fitting precursor to the hilarious yet obvious shoutings of Art Brut and the schizophrenic hyper-noise of labelmates like Deerhoof and Bunnybrains. Adopting a line from the band's hilarious art-rock lampoon ""Frank: A Rock Opera"", Bedard gave his post-Ickies film the title I'm Not Fascinating. Any otherwise-decent person who has ever slowed down near a car crash might beg to differ.","Overdue 61-track retrospective compiles the band's two albums plus assorted shits/giggles, all otherwise out of print.

The Repulsion Box,Sons and Daughters,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67eb1335d7bf1698e3f/1:1/w_160/09a5c446.jpg,2005-08-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7774-the-repulsion-box/,Domino,"The Repulsion Box opens with several seconds of naked kickdrum hammering out a 4/4 stomp. The next 31 minutes are a headlong blur of scratchy guitar, Celtic and country influences, pounding rhythm, and Scottish accents, a brand of danceable Glasgow post-punk that actually makes a sonic point of its Scottishness. The adversarial vocal interplay of Scott Paterson and Adele Bethel provides a dramatic focal point for the band's thumping arrangements. In my review of their debut EP, last year's Love the Cup, I compared them to Prolapse with their shoegaze tendencies replaced by Highland folk and slide guitar, and the comparison still holds here. As it turns out, the album's brief running time is something of a saving grace, as the band's relentless approach-- even the quiet songs ride fast, insistent beats-- is a bit numbing over the course of a whole LP. The music is intensely simple, almost minimalist, and Ailidh Lennon's bass (she switches to mandolin on opener ""Medicine"") locks in with drummer David Yow to create the irresistible undertow that churns Paterson's guitar into knotty tangles. Even with the band's relatively monochromatic range, there are a few standout tracks. The jumpy scuzzbucket march ""Dance Me In"", Bethel taking lead against a chorus of ""whoa-oh""ing Patersons as fierce snare drum crookedly crackles below. ""Taste the Last Girl"" rides a shuffle beat and features the album's biggest chorus, one of the few that doesn't explode from a more subdued verse. Paterson's slide guitar gets its best workout on ""Choked"", erupting in manic, violent outbursts. The record's arid, unadorned sound-- as captured with almost live rawness by Nick Cave and PJ Harvey producer Victor Van Vugt-- does have its occasional drawbacks, one being that in some of her more outlandish moments of rage, Bethel's vocals stand out a little too strongly, such as her shrill screams on the chorus of ""Gone"" and some of her more emphatic shouts on ""Red Receiver"". But the rough-around-the-edges sound generally works in the band's favor, the record's feeling of spontaneity often proving one of its biggest assets. Sons & Daughters are far from perfect, but The Repulsion Box is an energetic, sometimes thrilling record by a band slowly but surely carving out a unique niche for themselves.","Scottish band follows its promising Love the Cup EP with an record of danceable post-punk.

The Legend,Johnny Cash,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53fc0084474cd0c0697/1:1/w_160/773763e5.jpg,2005-08-11 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1333-the-legend/,Columbia,"America likes its heroes to bleed of-the-dirt ""authenticity""-- to carry a bible and have spent time in jail, to struggle with fidelity and caw about murder and remorse. Consequently, the box set section of most American record stores currently boasts a big, black mess of Johnny Cash-themed cubes. Posthumous marketing is particularly vicious: The Original Sun Albums, Unearthed, Man in Black, and now the four-disc The Legend bang corners, demanding further canonization, tapping persistently at our shoulders and wallets. Still, the diversity of the Cash shopping spectrum is oddly apt: Both in-store and out, there are loads of different Cash archetypes to choose from. Check Outlaw Cash, with his middle finger shooting heavenward, face scrunched into anti-authoritarian glee, invading prison yards and calmly bellowing, ""I shot a man in Reno/ Just to watch him die."" Conjure Country Cash, standing alongside Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, eyes hard, shaking his head at Nashville's pop-evolution. Note Family Cash, devoutly religious, wanting to record gospel songs with Sam Phillips, curling into June, and praying to be faithful. Or watch Neo-Cash lock arms with Rick Rubin, inadvertently charming the PBR-and-Pumas set with loads of quasi-ironic covers. It's only logical, then, that The Legend is all-Cash in all forms. It's the most comprehensive Cash box released to date, covering nearly a half-century (1955-2002) of song, parsing his discography into four logically-titled discs: ""Win, Place and Show: The Hits"", which gathers radio favorites, ""Old Favorites and New"", all classic Cash, ""The Great American Songbook"", which sees Cash tackling traditional cuts, and ""Family and Friends"", two dozen collaborative cuts. The Legend is being released by Columbia, and unsurprisingly, focuses more heavily on Cash's Columbia work than his early Sun recordings. Regardless, its four discs expertly showcase the astonishing scope of Cash's talent: ranging from goofy, 1950s teen dance-pop (""Ballad of a Teenage Queen"", ""Guess Things Happen That Way"") to gospel (""Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord)"", with the Carter Family) to traditional Americana standards (""I've Been Working on the Railroad"", ""Streets of Laredo""). The breadth of Cash's songbook almost justifies the dozens of roles he's been hustled into over the last 50 years-- and with seven previously unreleased songs, dug up from tapes in a backroom at the House of Cash, devotees are sure to start rethinking all other boxes crowding their shelves. Cash recorded his first single for Sun in 1955 (""Hey, Porter"" / ""Cry, Cry, Cry""), featuring Marshall Grant on bass and Luther Perkins on guitar (then known as the Tennessee Two, and later, after W.S. Holland, one of country music's very first drummers, joined the lineup, as the Tennessee Three). But it wasn't until 1956, with the release of ""I Walk the Line"", a dutiful promise of loyalty to then-wife Vivian Liberto, that Cash managed to snag a hit. Appropriately, ""I Walk the Line"" opens the first disc of The Legend, its meandering guitar line interrupted by Cash's tinny humming, pitter-patter percussion, and that voice: Soul and gravity were hard-wired into Johnny Cash's pipes. Rumbling and shockingly understated, Cash's deep, belly-blows sound like divine direction, all confidence and purity. The effects are transformative: Imagine ""Ring of Fire"" sung karaoke-style, and then reconsider how Cash's grim nonchalance pushes the song to new levels of weird profundity, a sober counterpart to its yapping horns and jiggly rhythms. Disc One corrals all of Cash's proper hits, making for a monstrous party record; Disc Two offers up a less cohesive collection (herded in under the vague heading ""Old Favorites and New""), but manages some impressive transitions. Cash's rendition of ""Long Black Veil"" (also attempted by Joan Baez, David Allen Coe, Marianne Faithful, the Band, and Bobby Bare) is properly captivating: when Cash gets to the ""me"" in ""The slayer who ran/ Looked a lot like me,"" his voice presses delicately but firmly, guaranteeing loads of jittery chills. Disc Two also harbors three previously unissued tracks, the best of which falls first: ""Doin' My Time"" is a pert, swinging ode to proper imprisonment, complete with guitar solo and courthouse laments. Disc Three is packed with American classics, including a handful of Leadbelly songs (collected by Alan Lomax, of course), some Jimmie Rodgers, and plenty of Traditional cuts. Disc Four, which includes a mess of duets (see Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Ray Charles, and others), has its questionable moments (Cash fronting U2 for ""The Wanderer"" is particularly gruesome), but closes with The Legend's prized jewel: ""It Takes One to Know Me"", written by Carlene Carter, June Carter Cash's daughter from her marriage to country star Carl Smith. Johnny attempted to record the song in 1977, as a duet with June, but left the song unfinished; Carlene's brother, John Carter Cash, agreed to produce the track, adding backing vocals by himself, his wife Laura, and his sister Carlene. ""It Takes One to Know Me"" mixes pristine, swelling strings with schmaltzy piano and guitar, but the vocals are mind-blowingly gritty: June and Johnny croon in perfect imperfect harmony, vowing earnest devotion to each other, acknowledging all the knots inherent to matrimony. The results are hauntingly real. People tend to discuss Johnny Cash with grave, unbridled reverence, which is appropriate but awkward: His website (which bursts open with a booming ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash, welcome to JohnnyCash.com!"", a proclamation just loud and weird enough to knock you off your chair), compares ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" to ""In God We Trust"", claiming both ""resonate throughout the world"" and ""stand the test of time."" The liner notes to The Legend boast that in 1969, Muhammad Ali and Johnny Cash were the best-known people on the planet. Cash's prominence may have wilted slightly in the past 35 years, but not significantly, and The Legend. should only confirm Cash's American Hero cred-- not as some presupposed ""authentic,"" but as an astoundingly multi-talented songwriter.","4xCD box set celebrates the life and music of the ""Man in Black,"" with one disc each devoted to his singles, album tracks, interpretations of traditional folk songs and standards, and collaborative works.

Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited / Walker OST,The 101'ersJoe Strummer,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58fea9e61561daa5180/1:1/w_160/a905c60e.jpg,2005-08-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11834-elgin-avenue-breakdown-revisitedwalker-ost/,Andalucia,"Apart from the Clash, Joe Strummer's output was a little disappointing. Granted, it seems impossible to get past the legend, for him or for listeners. He appears to have been more intelligent-- or at least better spoken-- than your average first-generation punk, and his vocals sounded fierce in their commitment to the material. His lefty politics had a bristling integrity, yet weren't so extreme as to be inaccessible or unrealistic. All in all, he showed many younger musicians that it was possible to play punk that was more than nihilist or fascist. To many, he represents rock's most populist principles, grandest ambitions, and highest callings. A handful of good-not-great albums and one or two side projects were all the solo work he left when he died suddenly in 2002, and none of it compares to his work with the Clash. But really, most anything would have paled next to The Clash or London Calling. His influences were wide-ranging, although nowadays they're rarely as regarded as those he influenced. He found inspiration in early rock n' roll, particularly the Sun Studio sound (it's no coincidence Jim Jarmusch cast him in the Memphis-set Mystery Train, arguably his finest post-Clash work). And yet, his later solo albums like Global A-Go-Go, Rock Art and the X-Ray Style, and parts of Streetcore drew from world music influences. As in his politics, his music readily acknowledged a world and a culture apart from Western imperialists. Astralwerks is resurrecting two projects that showcase the diversity of his musical interests: a collection of songs from his band the 101'ers and a mid-1980s soundtrack he composed. The 101'ers were a London pub-rock band that formed in the early 1970s and played around London exhaustively. They cut several demos, prepared a single, and toured with the Sex Pistols before Strummer joined what would become the Clash. Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited-- a mouthful of a title-- collects all their recorded output onto one disc, providing a brief but thorough overview of the band's short career. It encompasses the LP Elgin Avenue Breakdown, which was released in 1981, and a few live tracks and an alternate take of their lone single, ""Keys to Your Heart"" (reportedly inspired by future Slits drummer Palmolive). In addition to contemporary groups like Dr. Feelgood, the obvious pub-rock connection is early r&b;, derived from early progenitors like Chuck Berry and Ike Turner through the early Beatles-- at times it sounds like Elgin Avenue could be located in Hamburg. They even cover ""Maybelline"". While pub-rock has modest aims, Revisited proves generally solid, anchored by songs like ""letsagetabitarockin'"" and ""Steamgauge 99"", rambunctious run-throughs that rush headlong into their melodies, as Strummer delivers his lyrics in a garbled slur. But there really are no surprises here, just a general consistency on the studio tracks that bleeds into repetitiveness, hinting that Strummer turned to punk perhaps out of restlessness with pub-rock's strictures. The live cuts of ""Maybelline"" and ""Gloria"" suggest he was already halfway there by the time he met his future bandmates. Skip ahead almost a decade: After the Clash had a top 10 U.S. hit with ""Rock the Casbah"", the group disbanded, and an aimless Strummer acted in and soundtracked the Nicaraguan epic Walker, starring Ed Harris and directed by Alex Cox. Cox was and still is notorious for Repo Man and Sid & Nancy, and he and Strummer worked together on Straight to Hell around the same time. Walker was an ambitious flop, but Strummer's soundtrack holds up fairly well, thanks mainly to a group of seasoned musicians. His mix of Latin American music with a determined pop flair creates some intriguing moments, like the rollicking rhythms and Zander Schloss's quick picking on ""Machete"" and the two versions of the samba ""Filibustero"" (the original and a remix that originally appeared on a rare 12""), which bookend the soundtrack nicely. The vocal tracks sound like barroom sing-alongs, rowdy and slurred, but tuneful and more atmospheric than many of the instrumental tracks. But Walker is as much a product of its time and circumstances as of Strummer's imagination. With its slick saxophone, ""Latin Romance"" sounds like a lost '80s relic, a slice of cinematic cheese. Strummer seems as confined here as he did with the 101'ers, which may be due to the restrictions either of the film itself or of the soundtrack form. Like Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited, Walker at the very least expands our picture of Strummer as it presents an artist whose imagination was often bigger than the forms he worked in-- a predicament that created a compelling tension between possibility and actuality, the music as it is and the music as it could have been.","Reissues of Joe Strummer's pub-rock beginnings and his work on the soundtrack to Alex Cox's 1987 film about Nicaragua.

Tenderfoot,Without Gravity,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaafc0084474cd0c122b/1:1/w_160/293bebfe.jpg,2005-08-10 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8797-tenderfoot/,One Little Indian,"Considering both the population of Iceland and Björk's and Sigur Rós's immense global popularity, the country's got a pretty darn efficient music scene. Chalk the suprising success up to a supportive art community, high literacy rates, or the nation's awe-inspiring natural beauty, but not everyone in Reykjavik is totally happy with this alt-oligarchy. Enter folk outfit Without Gravity, a band whose jingoist press releases call for an indie revolt to show the world what Icelandic music's really about-- simple, American grass-roots folk. Denouncing many of their compatriots for aiming simply to ""outweird each other,"" Without Gravity at least has an admirable goal. In the tradition of European folksters Donovan or Nick Drake, Without Gravity borrows heavily from the American country/folk rock scene; yet while those 1960s-bred artists looked to Dylan, Without Gravity settles for passing as a fatigued Iron & Wine. Single-name vocalist Kalli (What? No accent or umlaut?!) leads a lumberjack version of the Hives, keeping the music simple, the wardrobe plaid and denim, and the message clear and repetitious; guy gets sad, guy retreats to nature for introspection, guy feels redeemed. To further homogenize matters, each song's arrangement and intensity is virtually identical. Two acoustics, upright bass, and pussyfoot percussion, making for one powerful 45-minute elephant tranquilizer of oceans, skies, rivers, and birds rallying around choruses like, ""Where have you gone?/ What have I done?"" and ""It's been far too long/ It's been far too cold."" If these guys want credit for breaking from your country's traditionally ambient, experimental artists, they can have their kudos, but it's a Pyrrhic victory. For all their rabble-rousing ambitions, Tenderfoot succeeds only in capturing an aesthetic at its most structural. Fortunately, Without Gravity doesn't overtly cater to the adult contemporary crowd, save for some misused mandolins and strings. However, if there were a distinctive, single-worthy song here, you'd probably be looking at Iceland's Grammy-friendly answer to David Gray. As is, it seems the great Icelandic folk takeover falls flat on its face, and the title of ""Third Most Popular Icelander"" still rests safely in the hands of, oh let's just say, Prime Minister Halldór \xC1sgrí2msson?","Icelandic band borrows heavily from 1960s Euro folksters Donovan and Nick Drake.

"Bestial Machinery, Vol. 1",Agoraphobic Nosebleed,by: Austin Gaines,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c4ea9e61561daa4899/1:1/w_160/a5f2cbe2.gif,2005-08-10 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/479-bestial-machinery-vol-1/,Relapse,"As my friend and I were riding around our mid-size southern town, listening to the new Agoraphobic Nosebleed, he turned to me and said, ""This stuff's pretty cool but a whole album of it just turns into whatever after a few minutes...but, they've got a good drummer."" That's because their percussionist is a fucking inanimate object from Japan called a drum machine. At least my friend was correct about one thing: Agoraphobic Nosebleed's digital grind-power violence-hardcore turns into ""whatever"" in just a short period of time. Their credo revolves around bringing glory to the sacred deity of speed and grind, while their profane lyrics flicker with fury and pomposity. At least I assume they do, as they don't feel the need to provide the listener with written lyrics for this 2xCD reissue, which encompasses everything they did prior to their first Relapse record, Honky Reduction. Recording for Relapse, ANb grew restless with their standard grind sound and released Frozen Corpse Stuffed With Dope with all of its strange digital flourishes and Altered States of America with of all its two-second tracks. Bestial Machinery represents a purer time when the sorcery of a machine was being harnessed because of ANb's inability to find a drummer of suitable speed. It's definitely not ""straight"" grindcore but it's also not drastically different from any album that colorful reviewers call ""filled to the brim with buzz saw guitars that cut like a rusty bayonet through the ripe flesh of venereal diseased Vietnamese hookers."" You've heard many albums like it, but in an established hardcore genre it's not whether you break the formula, it's whether you can give it enough attitude to make it interesting. ANb have a little bit of attitude-- and a bunch of kickass cartoon devils and skulls on their cover! I could see this cover art being photocopied and plastered on some notebooks at school, right under someone's hand drawn Slayer logo. It's that good. Disc One contains 76 tracks-- taken from various 7-inch records and splits-- of flailing guitars and cathartic screaming, while the drum machine farts off non-stop double bass. It's not metaphysics or anything, but with titles such as ""From Filth to Defilement"", ""The Newlyweds Are Raped"", and ""The Executioner Vs. The Sodomite"", it's just good, wholesome Satan-influenced stuff. There are 60 more songs on Disc Two. The demos on Disc Two sag due to their lackluster mixing and production, while compilation tracks seem misplaced. Most grind snaps you into attention at the beginning then you either catch the groove (if you can call it that) or you tune it out in an ambient fashion and let your mind wander. Bestial Machinery mixes the two and turns into a sort of interesting drone. It's not bad music as far as this goes, it just isn't filled with one interesting idea after another, which is what is usually needed to be completely engrossed. After a little while it simply turns into ""whatever."" But it's a really loud and fast whatever.","Relapse unveils a 2xCD, 136-track collection of AHb's early 7-inch recordings and demos.

Suburban Hymns,The Life and Times,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde713d197565213b650/1:1/w_160/5e5198eb.jpg,2005-08-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4987-suburban-hymns/,DeSoto,"Allen Epley, former frontman of Shiner and current main man of The Life and Times, has seen more than his fair share of personnel changes under his watch. Shiner's drummer was replaced before it recorded an album, and it set the tone for several more switches centering around singer/guitarist Epley and bassist Paul Malinowski of Season to Risk. When Season to Risk broke up, Shiner absorbed two more of its members to record The Egg, the band's fourth and best effort. The album struck an engaging balance between melody and slight experimentation, but soon after its release the band unceremoniously dissolved. The Life and Times has already changed some members between its debut EP and this, its first LP, but by working fast and sweeping up two local musicians (Eric Albert from Ring, Cicada on bass and Chris Metcalf of Stella Link on drums), Allen Epley has finally found a band that fits. On Suburban Hymns, shoegaze-inspired guitars are neatly folded between heavy modern rock drumming, rhythms are toyed with, stretched, and collapsed on songs like ""Muscle Cars"" and ""Skateland"", and the band creates a wall of sound that moves in and evaporates like fog, leaving only keyboards and moogs behind. It's a new step for Epley that, for once, places mood and atmosphere ahead of the riffs. The tradeoff is that mood takes precedence over hooks. There are catchy moments-- the winding melodies from the propulsive ""Coat of Arms"" and ""Running Red Lights"" and closing ballad ""A Chorus of Crickets""-- but most songs, like ""Muscle Cars"" or the ironically-titled ""Thrill Ride"", are well-executed mood pieces. ""Skateland"" escapes the mire with a strong (if grunge-like) vocal performance and some subtle piano during the bridge, but subtle touches can become lost amongst the band's bluster. Ghostly falsetto floats throughout opener ""My Last Hostage"" and drifts above the propulsive ""Coat of Arms"" that follows, and the overpowering keyboards of ""Mea Culpa"" fade into the lonely moogs that open ""A Chorus of Crickets"", where we hear Epley's untreated voice for the first time. Despite the pessimistic title, it cant help but sound inspiring, a light ballad with just enough restraint. Lyrics about drinking the ocean or ""ice cubes in the sea"" sound clumsy at first, but when taken together and included with song titles like ""A Chorus of Crickets"" and lines like ""running with the bulls to the latest hit parade,"" an attitude emerges. Producer J. Robbins, who usually records emo and punk bands with sharp, clean production, consistently distorts Epley's voice while making the rest of the band sound like a sharpened jangle-spitting machine. It compliments Epley's voice well, but there's a thematic precedence for Robbins' choices. Epley's moaning sounds heavy with resignation, and his voice floats above the band rather than with it. The guitars that play just behind the slow, galloping drums of ""Skateland"" sound like the three men of The Life and Times overwhelmed by the apathy of the world, playing fiercely to themselves with their back turned to the audience. The chemistry between the band's members is easy to hear, but it seems like a heavy shrug of the shoulders compared to the boundaries pushed during the last days of Shiner.

Chemistry,Buckshot,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a494ea9e61561daa4f31/1:1/w_160/3c4fb634.jpg,2005-08-10 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1172-chemistry/,Duckdown,"Despite all the campaigning done on 9th Wonder's behalf (slow down already, ?uestlove), the North Carolinian's most successful efforts have been in rallying to the cause of MC's bleeding on the cot. After his group Little Brother's decent debut, The Listening, 9th pre-empted Dangermouse's ballyhooed Grey Album by rethinking Nas' God's Son as Illmatic's reprise, an achievement which bought him studio time with Nas nemesis Jay-Z on The Black Album. Convolution is a wonderful thing-- his Hovi track, not so much. Following his work with rap's fave retiree, 9th spun an album of breezy takes on Left Coast G-funk on Murs' 3:16. Now, he's teamed with the oft-forgotten Buckshot of Black Moon/Boot Camp Clik for an album that breathes life, yet again, into the mid-90s NYC sound. Here, as opposed to some 22-year-olds nostalgia jacking, it's fitting, as Chemistry blends 9th's backward-glancing production and Buck's timeless street talk to results that find both pushing the outer limits of their natural abilities. Chemistry's biggest surprise is Buckshot's energy. It's been a rough road for the BDI MC, and he's starving here, taking large bites out of the new guard. For instance, ""Everybody got a label or a mixtape/ Saying you gettin' money/ But next week, it's back to your shift and break/ 'Til your back shift and break."" Spoken like a man who's been touted as the Next Man but realized he isn't. Buckshot still stretches his syllables like a rubber band, letting the ends of lines snap with the beat. The sing-toast style that is the calling card of Boot Camp's finest merges nicely with 9th Wonder's rolling bass, swooning string samples, and stop/start drum programming. Buckshot's decision to partner with 9th says as much about his self-awareness as his business acumen, linking up with the one producer in his price range that can recreate the Beatminerz/Large Professor/Premier aura of Buck's heyday. Working with new blood with old ideas has Buck feeling his fighting legs again; Buckshot's soft talk/big stick approach always has and always will sound best in front of a string section and pulled taffy basslines. Put him up with some synthed-out thugtronics and his allure would be lost amongst the clamor. Apparently written on the fly after hearing 9th's tracks for Boot Camp alum Sean Price's album, Buck's rhymes are a reminder of the verbal wizardry that had him mentioned alongside Nas, Big, and the Wu fellows once upon a time. His voice has always been a simmering fire, a gravelly, almost whispering menace certainly inspired by some Rakim mirror mugging. Albums like Chemistry are written off by a lot of people who don't get down with its retro leanings-- and it certainly doesn't help that 9th Wonder is only a serviceable replacement for those with whom he's compared. His sample selection is tasteful, but someone needs to buy my man some drums. It's a simple question of technique. His predecessors-- Pete Rock, Primo, Large Professor via Paul C (Google ""Dave Tompkins Paul C""), and even Boot Camp's own Da Beatminerz-- all chopped sampled drums, and the results were full, thick slabs of marbled beats. 9th programs his own, and they are hollow and processed. But, that's how it goes when a snare can be traced and tapped for royalty payments. Thankfully, Buckshot doesn't seem to care he's rhyming over a facsimile of the salad days. He's thrilled to be back in the game, even if it's one he can't necessarily win.","Little Brother producer teams with the oft-forgotten emcee from Brooklyn's Black Moon.

Are You Ready For More? EP,The Go! Team,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0055e6ef959693234b7/1:1/w_160/f50c837b.gif,2005-08-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3655-are-you-ready-for-more-ep/,self-released,"Ian Parton should be on top of the world right now. His home, let's-fuck-around-with-a-sampler project has grown into an internationally buzzed-about album, Thunder, Lightning, Strike; his band has signed to Columbia for American distribution; and his show at the Intonation Festival brought Pitchfork staffers to tears like the ending of Field of Dreams. Yes, Ian Parton is surely living the good life, hitting his stride, and all sorts of other positive clichés. OR IS HE? You see, certain demands come with a higher profile, and Parton now finds himself besieged by problems that surely never intruded upon his home-recorded masterpiece. Thanks to TLS's reliance upon samples, the Go! Team is now confronted with the terrifying visage of the American legal system, which recently brought the Beastie Boys all the way to the doorstep of the Supreme Court over three notes of flute music. There's also the challenge of having a band on the payroll-- a feature that has the potential to expand the group's sound, but also carries the risk of hamstringing Parton's creativity. The full ramifications of these new challenges won't be known until the remixed Thunder, Lightning, Strike and the band's second album arrive, but this tour EP-- sold on the Go! Team's recent jaunt Down Under-- offers a few early clues. For starters, there's the new ""single version"" of ""Bottle Rocket"", which is presumably washed clean of any musical snippets that might unleash the law's fury. While the differences are minor-- the most prominent is an exchange of the original's sampled rap for a vocal by frontwoman Ninja-- it's still disorienting to those off us who have lived with TLS for a year, sort of like seeing your girlfriend with a new haircut. The tracks that resemble TLS' overstuffed hybrids are previously released B-sides. ""The Ice Storm"" bases its jittery, drum-less energy around what sounds like The Exorcist's tubular-bells score and a mournful organ, while ""We Listen Everyday"" is further proof that the Go! Team's most obvious touchstone, intentional or no, is the Avalanches, thanks to its deft blend of dusty, out-of-time artifacts all filtered through a fuzzy-stylus turntable. More reassuring is new track ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"", which reunites the shrill cheerleader samples with Charlie Brown piano and horn blasts. Like a three-minute sampler of Parton's favorite sounds, it's proof that the band's TLS sound isn't tapped out. The two remaining songs, previously unreleased ""Did You Feel It Too?"" and ""The Power Is On"" B-side ""Hold Yr Terror Close"", are the most significant deviations from the Go! Team's album, both showcasing drummer Chi Fukami's twee vocals. The tracks are little more than piano and vocals but they also tap the nostalgia button, exchanging the cop-show and Morricone score influences for the simple ditties that used to back ""Sesame Street"" montages of playground safety or crayon factories. They got ""Sesame Street"" in England, right? So this tour-only EP, whether it becomes a widely available item or not, maintains the Go! Team's momentum. Like most EPs, it's merely a snack to keep fans satiated between albums, but at least it gives us something to add to our file library while we speculate whether the band can navigate its next challenge: avoiding the sophomore slump.","Six-track, Australia-only tour EP unveils the re-recorded ""Bottle Rocket"" and adds some B-sides and previously unreleased material.

Wrath of Circuits,The Nein,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b984c0084474cd0c261b/1:1/w_160/a401949e.jpg,2005-08-09 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5917-wrath-of-circuits/,Sonic Unyon,"Mired in self-consciously muddy aural manipulations, this North Carolina band can't (and don't) live up to their acute, exacting name on this debut full-length. With the post-punk party currently in the thick of its heaving, cash-in-reunion stage (a precursor to the inevitable ""Real World vs. Road Rules""-style cannibalization), the foursome tries to reinvigorate the bash by throwing out the straight-on kick-drum angularity of their EP and enrolling in a hazy art class where Dave Thomas visually represents skewed entropy by throwing Mark E. Smith through a sugar-glass window. Hardly melodic and not adventurous or invigorating enough to pull off the scuzzy brassiness of its yelping forefathers, the Nein get all anguished and pissed as it alternates between grubby grunge slow jams and lo-fi oom-pah on Wrath of Circuits. Much of the group's murkiness can be credited to the addition of samples guy Dale Flattum, who sprays utterly random noises all over the album, diluting its semi-weak impact in the process. On ""The Vibe"" we get aquarium bubble pops, atonal video game bleeps, and a plinky keyboard loop, but instead of somehow adding a much-needed fresh Faustian dimension to the song, the found sounds highlight its aimlessness. With Flattum's tape wrangling a constant distraction, inconspicuously snarling singer Finn Cohen seems to be holding back from truly unleashing a wail worthy of the best posting and punking. His largely incomprehensible musings on relationships and technology make Trail of Dead's similarly themed Source Tags & Codes seem like an unbridled lyrical masterpiece. Fittingly, the ""oh oh"" chorus of the relatively lucid, hi-hat stomping ""Lost Sounds"" provides brief respite from the purveying sub-Sparta At the Drive In spin-off crud. Proving once again that the Nein would be better off without their own muddle butt Jim O'Rourke causing an unrequited mess, the spare ""Bleeding Elvis"" is a fine smooth-burning ballad Trent Reznor would love to cry about. Just try to ignore the words--""I had to replace those integers with impossible functions and irrational combinations leading to more furtive glances""-- which are headache causing pseudo-computer puzzles nobody wants to crack. Excess is usually something post-punks don't have time to worry about-- and it should stay that way. Though they're clearly (desperately) trying to initiate their own neo-post branch, the Nein don't have the tunes or the funk or the strut to break free from the surplus sonic ballyhoo that engulfs much of Circuits. Maybe they should have just copied Gang of Four. More.","Debut LP splits time between grubby slow jams and lo-fi oom-pah.

Every Kind of Light,The Posies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a100c0084474cd0bfceb/1:1/w_160/8b089a0c.jpg,2005-08-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6429-every-kind-of-light/,Ryko,"The Posies officially broke up in 1998, and immediately became one of the most prolific bands on the planet, kicking out albums, live recordings, EPs, compilations, and boxed sets. It's almost as if disbanding or the thought of disbanding (they never actually got around to it) made them realize how much they liked being in the band, relative lack of commercial success be damned. Since that initial flood of releases, the un-broken-up Posies-- which, it should be noted, is just a shorthand for John Auer and Ken Stringfellow-- have been much quieter, and after plenty of time lending their talents to other bands, including the reunited Big Star, they've finally dropped their sixth studio album. Unfortunately, the wait comes to a fairly unsatisfying end, with Every Kind of Light largely failing live up to the band's original run. It's not a terrible, but it doesn't exactly play to their strengths, either. Indeed, it seems as though Auer & Stringfellow are somewhat preoccupied with proving that they rock, and it comes at the expense of the effortless hook-craft of Frosting on the Beater and Success. Frosting... represents the band's commercial (and, for me, creative) peak, and it seems as though they're reaching back to that sound on a lot of these songs, but in the wrong order. Whereas the crunchiness of that record was incidental, the volume cranked high in the service of the songwriting, in this case, the guys seem to be writing the songs to fit the volume they want to play at, a strategy that doesn't work nearly as well. So you get self-conscious rockers like ""I Finally Found a Jungle I Like"", a flailing song with novelty lyrics and a horn part that references the Who's ""5:15"" but that's way too busy and graceless to leave a lasting impact. ""All in a Day's Work"" similarly pounds away with tons of distortion but forgets to offer anything memorable. If that were the whole story, the record would be an unqualified mess, but thankfully, the Posies are too good to make an entire album of uninspired goop. You can hear echoes of the band's past glory in the exquisite verse melody of ""I Guess You're Right"" and the thundering, Moog-tinged rocket ride of ""Second Time Around"", the album's only song that strives for their trademark heavy pop rush and actually nails it. Elsewhere, album opener ""It's Great to Be Here Again"" is a fascinating foray into a humid, claustrophobic r&b; sound, with guitars and mellotrons trading off the ominous countermelodies while Auer and Stringfellow interweave their vocals with their usual deftness. Auer's effortlessly melodic ballad ""Conversations"" is another highlight, featuring soft verse/loud chorus grunge dynamics that should feel played out by now, but actually work perfectly. Stringfellow gets in his own nice ballad with the alcohol-soaked ""Last Crawl"", a song that reflects a lot of his recent solo work with its smooth AM gold sheen. So it's not the jaw-dropping affirmation of the Posies' non-break-up that we might have hoped for, but Every Kind of Light is ultimately a decent record spiked with a few classic moments of patent posies pop ecstasy. Fans will want to have it, for sure, but everyone else can just wander through the back catalog to Frosting... or the Dream All Day compilation. The Posies may not be what they once were, but, if only for the handful of great songs they offer here, I'm glad they're still around.","Sixth studio album from the power-pop band, which now is effectively the duo of John Auer and Ken Stringfellow.

Just Another Band From the Cosmic Inferno,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff4ea9e61561daa445f/1:1/w_160/657d3b52.gif,2005-08-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/25-just-another-band-from-the-cosmic-inferno/,Important,"You'll notice that Kawabata Makoto's Acid Mothers Temple has a new sub-name and (sort of) a new band. On the 10th anniversary of the founding of Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., it came time for Makoto to re-energize the project. As he writes in the liner notes of this release, after countless records and constant touring, ""I began to feel the need for some powerful, new force that could stand against the virtually extinct dinosaur of Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., a worthy rival who could read the last rites to the corpse."" Inspired, Makoto took the band from his solo Mothers of Invasion project and transformed them into Acid Mothers Temple & the Cosmic Inferno. You might find all this a bit odd when you consider that Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. itself had a regularly shifting lineup, and that some musicians here are common to both bands. As a cosmic traveler from another generation once said, ""If you get confused, listen to the music play."" The guitar on the two long (long) tracks is immediately identifiable as Makoto in heavy (heavy) riff mode. ""Trigger In Trigger Out"" opens with a short wisp of drone and then launches into a primordial blooze-rock riff that's only a couple parsecs in AMT space-time from ZZ Top's ""Tush"". From this simple guitar stomp Makoto goes positively apeshit, exploring every harmonic corner suggested by the chords with a torrent of acid-drenched and fiercely wha-wha'd notes. While Makoto solos his way into the setting sun, returning to the riff every five minutes or so as if to refuel, bass and drums hammer the hook home and crude analog synths pan rapidly between the speakers. Occasional voices howl from somewhere in the distance, offering some approximation of what it must have sounded like when Jefferson Airplane played a free concert in Golden Gate Park...from four blocks away. ""Trigger In Trigger Out"" pushes past 20 minutes, which is slightly insane when you consider the energy level sustained throughout, but ""They're Coming from the Cosmic Inferno"" is the real straightjacket material. Forty-four minutes this one goes on for, and again nearly all space is filled with balls-out soloing. The riff is less a focus here. As the band locks into an unyielding metronomic krautrock groove, Makoto takes a free form and less blues-based approach, letting his leads go where they want to go. The biggest problem with the record is the sound quality. The band is obviously playing live in studio and Makoto is credited as the engineer, so that could be part of the problem right there. In a sense the tinny and muddy nature of the production seems natural to the music, suggesting a connection to, say, the early 70s Zappa bootlegs that probably take up an entire wall of Makoto's apartment. But the guitar heaviness that seems so crucial isn't what it could be, and the other instruments get lost in the mix. The problem is alleviated somewhat when you listen at extreme volume (everything sounds better loud, but this record makes no sense otherwise). Still, if you can stomach the epic length and don't feel a headache coming on, there's something special happening. Though the snarling music projects a certain ugliness and undeniable aggression, the band's ultimate m.o. is transformative ecstasy achieved through profound disorientation. If the Cosmic Inferno catches you in the right mood, they just might get you there.","Kawabata Makoto's Acid Mothers Temple releases its first LP with the ""& the Cosmic Inferno"" tag.

Quit +/or Fight,Holopaw,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c10cabf31b7dc715656b/1:1/w_160/cd3a5fbc.jpg,2005-08-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3909-quit-or-fight/,Sub Pop,"In 2003, Holopaw's self-titled debut prodded the overlap between vague electronic twitterings and scrappy folk tradition-- its follow-up, Quit +/or Fight, sees Holopaw striking a slightly more symbiotic medium, the line between their blips and strums now appropriately faded. Quit +/or Fight may lack the immediate melodic punch of the band's debut-- it forsakes pristine strums for skewering electric guitar and scrappier arrangements-- but what the record sacrifices in warmth, it makes up for in atmospherics. Quit +/or Fight is Holopaw's first Christmas record, alternately sweet and grim, an impeccable homage to snow and weird, wintry disembodiment. These songs are dark and cold, and their August release-- sent squirting out into an expanse of rotting, hundred-plus days, drifting over boiled trash and limp, floppy gardens-- proves oddly apt. All the chills you'll feel will finally do some good. Holopaw's juxtapositions may be less striking now, but the results are more cohesive. Still, Quit takes a little extra time to settle into: Without being purposefully difficult, Quit +/or Fight can still be willfully (and successfully) obtuse, scrappy and determinably distanced from the shiny perfection of Holopaw. Since 2003, the band has added another guitar player (Tom Reno of Florida post-rockers the Mercury Program), and with members currently scattered from their former home base of Gainesville, FL, Holopaw has adopted the increasingly popular U.S.P.S. method of sound recording, drifting ideas back and forth from producer Mike Pecchio's studio in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Philadelphia, Florida, and elsewhere. Whimsical and charmingly slack, Quit +/or Fight harnesses that distance to create a record intensely sympathetic to gaps in place and time. Opener ""Losing Light"" is all pause and thumping drums, punctuated by prickly guitar lines and overdubbed vocals-- singer/lyricist John Orth (also of Isaac Brock side-project Ugly Cassanova) encapsulates late December with awkward, crushing intimacy, his voice drifting from half-whisper to full-song: ""The tree from the house to the curb/ Tinsel pathways to the yard...We're losing light/ The holiday, whittled down to this/ Plenty of time winding out."" Orth hits all the seasonal notes, from sugar plums to corduroys to fake snow to space heaters, but also manages to capture (at times, majestically) the glorious, scarf-wrapping loneliness inherent to deep freeze. ""Velveteen (All Is Bright.)"" is painfully transformative and one of the band's strongest tracks to date: Michael Johnson's cymbal swats crack and whimper like icicles shattering, filled in by Tobi Echevarria's thick, loping bass (think snowshoes) and Jeff Hays' wispy, hot-breath-on-cold-air pedal steel. Orth coos earnestly about Santa Claus steering his reindeer straight to the bottom of Lake Superior (""Without a thought he said 'Go Dasher, Go Dancer'/ And they dropped their heads, disappeared into the cloudbank...Those silver bells didn't make a sound when they fell to rest at the bottom of Superior""), which seems like a precious conceit, until you stop thinking about it and just listen to his poem: slowly, the song tumbles towards a thundering climax, all heavy, honking synths, and guitar push, Orth bellowing fervently ""All is calm/ All is bright/ And they're dragging the lake with peppermint hooks, pink rushing to frostbite tips""-- before slinking back into the band's signature closing hush. Unsurprisingly, Quit +/or Fight is also a breakup record, heavy with heartache and dark, belly-punching bits. Orth always had a photographer's sense of detail and light, and here, watching becomes an essential thematic reprise. In ""Curious"", a lover is shakily peered at from a clearing, and in ""Losing Light"", Orth's eyes turn to a sleeping body: ""I watch you like some newborn kid/ Curling your fingers in and out of fists/ Run my thumb across your hip."" Things aren't good (""I'm lost to you""), but Orth is veiled and careful with his details, immersing listeners in the fuzzy, shaking haze of endings. Musically, the band stretches its muscle: ""3-Shy-Clubs"" funnels mysterious percussive smacks into a groove-heavy bossa nova rhythm, while ""Curious"" folds in bass clarinet and sinewy falsetto. The title track originally appeared as a FOUND Magazine (publisher of found notes, letters, photographs, and stories) song of the month, and features a mess of snagged lyric crumbs, cobbled together into a shockingly logical whole (some of which seems like an eerily apropos PTSD response to military propaganda: ""OK, so I'm no longer/ The best of the best/ No longer defending the U.S.A."") Still, the track, which mixes tinkling bells with steel guitar caws and high, layered harmonies, has moments of chilly clarity: ""You've done enough/ Quit and/or Fight,"" Orth implores. It's the perfect title for a band that demanded self-evolution, and got exactly what it wanted.","On the band's sophomore Sub Pop release they trade warmth and immediacy for atmospherics.

The Difference Between Houses and Homes,Cursive,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c813d1975652139271/1:1/w_160/837f33b3.jpg,2005-08-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1702-the-difference-between-houses-and-homes/,Saddle Creek,"Collections of ""lost songs and loose ends""-- which is how Cursive's new The Difference Between Houses and Homes bills itself-- invite commentary on everything but the music. The overlooked tracks at hand are, more often than not, acknowledged duds. They get left behind for a reason. So what's the redeeming value of the albums that compile them? It's the artifact, man. History! Put yourself in the shoes of Omaha denizens Cursive. You've been together for 10 years. How better to calcify your status as Important Band than with an odds-and-sods compilation? It's practically a rite of passage. Behold, a snapshot: The Difference Between Houses and Homes offers 12 songs, culled from seven-inches and unreleased tape, spanning six years (1995-2001). I like Cursive, and had high hopes for this one. But the spendthrift in me blows a gasket when faced with the facts: These cast-asides aren't even offered at a discount; you'll pay the same for this as you did for The Ugly Organ, Cursive's latest and best studio album. Love to say it's worth it for a glimpse at evolution in progress, but this offal doesn't make for much of a menu dilemma: Given the choice, most folks will order the rib-eye over the hangar steak. Expectedly, the longest lost tracks (talking '95, '96) are the most amateurish. Stripped of the heady orchestral accouterments of the band's post-millenial work, opener ""Dispenser"" is all splintery emo (not emo) angst. (Here I must tell TextEdit to learn, for the eight billionth time, the cuss; how many Fall Out Boys will it take for the world to recognize the emo phenomenon?) ""Pivotal"", from 1998's ""Icebreaker"" seven-inch, is the same song, only minor-keyed and more convolutedly structured. Both numbers do everything they're supposed to: Take a riff, ruffle it with distortion, add a melodramatic vocal, and eu-fucking-reka. I have a high tolerance for vocal histrionics, but Tim Kasher has made a career of getting under listeners' skin, and The Difference finds him at his most unabashed. On ""There's a Coldest Day in Every Year"", he struggles to pilot the shapeless, vaguely psychedelic music. But it's songs like ""The Knowledgeable Hasbeens"", which require an indoor voice, that give Kasher the most trouble. I have no hang-ups with a vocalist ""hiding"" behind screaming; I wish this one would do so more often. But while Kasher's vox are rarely less than vociferous, his stilted delivery (a now-prevalent, mockingly hoarse style of which he was a progenitor) actually helps: It can be hilariously entertaining to hear him pitch a hissy, especially when it sounds like he's screaming, ""REGGAETON! REGGAETON!"" as on ""A Disruption in the Normal Swing of Things"". On balance, however, Kasher is less violent than silent. He leaves gaping voids for his band to fill, and they do, ably but often meanderingly. Clint Schnase has been Cursive's drummer since the band's inception and, while he does a serviceable job, I wish he'd erupt with more colossal, tom-heavy fills. Here he's tight and tasteful but mixed too high to justify the asceticism of his playing. The band's latter-day, fatter-budget albums have added reverb and instruments, diminishing any one player's import. A song like ""Nostalgia"", however, from 2001, would benefit from a slightly more rhythmically technical treatment, even if that would spell E-M-O-C-O-R-E. While collections like this aren't spared critical dissection, their real job is to get fans excited (again) about the issuing group. I have more than a few friends who would kill for my promo (to enter a lottery, email ubl@pitchforkmedia.com). Can't say The Difference Between Houses and Homes had me thirsting for my Cursive faves, although it came close: I now have this weird craving to hear Braid's ""Eulalia, Eulalia"". Man, that takes skill.","Odds and sods comp collects a dozen songs culled from seven-inches and unreleased tape, all of which were recorded from 1995-2001.

The knee-jerk reaction is to write off these boondoggles as publicity stunts; more realistically, they seem to stem from an abiding sense of playfulness: ""Let's see what'll happen if we do this."" How many extra records are you going to sell for pretending to be Arab on Radar, anyway? In another counterintuitive turn, the band known for their long, absurd song titles seems to have omitted them entirely from their latest EP. This could scan as a rejection of song-as-bio-fodder, a tacit manifesto stating that music belongs to the moment, not the museum. The stance would dovetail nicely with the fact that Oxes really occur in the ephemeral live setting, and remain unable to accurately translate their visceral shows to the album format. The five songs on Oxes EP are brambly, muscular math-metal slabs, but listening to pre-recorded versions of them is like looking at graffiti in an art gallery. The execution is remarkable, the lines expressive, the colors vibrant, but they lose something vital without the world clamoring around them. Still, Oxes manage to put a unique spin on math-rock and metal. Let's be frank: Math-rock is some boring, noodly-ass shit that, by packing ""surprises"" into every abrupt meter and dynamic shift, completely squanders its capacity to surprise. Oxes focus on math-rock's bodily, combustible potential and turn it into drunken party music, never forgetting which part of the genre's name is the modifier and which is the foundation. The bluesy metal vamp of the first track never squanders a shred of momentum for forced complexity, and the second is a twisted Southern rock shredfest that's intricate without being cerebral. While American metal often resorts to vague tropes of Germanic fascism, Oxes forgo guttural vocals and jackbooted cadences in favor a metal that sounds drenched in American pride. This faux-jingoism really comes to the fore on the fourth track, with its anthemic stomp and satirically patriotic guitar lead that echoes Hendrix's incensed ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". This blend of bombast and belligerence undercuts the entire album (ironically, but with a vitality that would shame Toby Keith), barring the final track, which bends toward a compressed, gnarly sort of Krautrock. If it isn't a breakthrough record, Oxes EP is another solid entry from a band that refuses to abandon the sense of play and mischief that rock music threatens to lose as it vies for space in the safe havens of glossy column inches.","Baltimore pranksters release five tracks of muscular math-metal.

It was eventually followed by The Body Haters. Since then Gira has focused on the song-oriented Angels of Light project and the chaperoning of freak-folkers Devandra Barnhart and the Akron/Family. Gira has now packaged his hour-long-song period with a 10 minute bonus track and expanded artwork full of swine and human sex organs. The Body Lovers is 73 minutes (segued into 10 tracks) of semi-calculated instrumentation-- the kind that doesn't find the artist jacking off with the EQ or sampler to their hearts content. It starts with what sounds like the distant chimes of gamelan music reverberating around a cavern and then morphs into a different winding style every eight minutes or so. There are funeral dirges, shimmering and floating guitars, crescendos reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor, impenetrable walls of stretched notes, austere jangle, samples of crying babies and weeping women, and only one minute of Gira singing. It's all attention holding and it's very reminiscent of what the Swans were trying on Soundtracks for the Blind, which is fitting since parts of Body Lovers were culled from sound samples dating back to 1982. The rest is from the standard Swans crew like Jarboe, Bill Rieflin, and Larry Mullins, while members of Pan Sonic, Origami, and Deathprod also make contributions. While The Body Lovers pulls disparate sounds together into one enthralling hour, The Body Haters just wanders around in some gloom and doom for 36 minutes. It simply sounds like Gira indulged in some looping software and did some half-assed processing. The bonus track is 10 minutes of instantly recognizable bits of Swans songs chopped up and layered on top of each other. The Body Haters isn't crap, it just pales in comparison to everything else Gira has done and therefore sounds very amateurish. But I'll allow a few mistakes in two decades of high quality mind warping music. If it's just repetitive droning, what makes The Body Lovers so good? It's because Gira has consistently made atmospheric music that doesn't take you into the atmosphere. It doesn't invite you to escape reality. It suffocates you with the not so comforting truths of humanity, without causing introspection, retrospection, or even speculation. The emotions are so strong yet so indistinct that half the Swans fans you'll meet can't make a cohesive argument as to why they listen to them. If Gira can cause all this enigmatic wonder in an hour-long piece without his trademark lyrics then he must truly be making special music...The catch is that it only works at night.","Double-disc reissue of a pair of late-90s Michael Gira projects.

Lepidoptera,Fursaxa,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beb8abf31b7dc71561b9/1:1/w_160/648f0733.jpg,2005-08-08 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3343-lepidoptera/,ATPATP,"The visionary 12th century theologian, scientist, and composer Hildegard von Bingen once referred to herself and her creations as ""a feather on the breath of God."" Perhaps it could be said that there are hints of this same celestial guidance at work in the ethereal music of West Philly's Tara Burke, aka Fursaxa. Drawing inspiration from Hildegard's hypnotic medieval plainchants, as well as from a host of other ancient folk and psychedelic traditions, Fursaxa's fourth official full-length Lepidoptera ripples and flutters with an enthralling mantric pulse uniquely its own. With previous albums released by Acid Mothers Temple and on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace, as well as appearances on such compilations as this year's epochal By the Fruits You Shall Know the Roots, Burke has managed to associate herself with the ongoing free-folk movement. But, as is the case with contemporaries like Charalambides or Tower Recordings, Fursaxa utilizes folk music's essential ingredients-- acoustic guitars, hand percussion, simple, repetitive melodies-- in a such a deeply personalized (and wholly unpredictable) fashion that she's able to construct enchanted new meadows of sound that exist completely beyond any reductive classification. Centered predominantly upon Burke's multi-tracked, endlessly coiled vocals and the steady hum of vintage keyboards, Fursaxa also bears comparison to Nico's The Marble Index and, especially, to the post-Opal solo work of Kendra Smith. As with those performers, Burke often tends to prefer arrangements that feature their instruments one or two at a time, with tracks like ""Russian Snow Queen"" carried along solely upon the steady current of a single pump organ and her swirling, wraith-like vocal loops. Despite their humble settings, however, the songs of Lepidoptera attain an astonishing degree of richness and tranquil warmth, possessing a depth of field unheard on earlier Fursaxa releases like 2000's Mandrake. Throughout the album, Burke's lyrics (such as they may be) remain stubbornly inscrutable, but on tracks like the opening convocation of ""Freedom"" her cascading, self-replicating harmonies render her actual words superfluous. And on the primitive campfire rounds of ""Velada"", ""Neon Lights"", or the expansive, sublime ""Poppy Opera"", one can't help be transfixed by the way her gently dividing melodies continually circle back on their tails, as Burke uses raised fingers to trace infinity symbols across the constellations, sounding for all the world like that feather carried aloft by unseen hands.","Fursaxa's fourth full-length draws inspiration from hypnotic medieval plainchants and other ancient folk and psychedelic traditions.

Analord 6 / 7 / 8,AFX,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0955e6ef9596931ffaf/1:1/w_160/6fa9385d.gif,2005-08-08 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11635-analord-6-7-8/,Rephlex,"Again, Richard James travels to his past-- if not to save the future, then at least to save extravagantly for it. The Aphex Twin mastermind's first project since 2001's perplexing Drukqs started promisingly enough, albeit expensively, with the 40 quid Analord 10 last December. However, subsequent offerings in this procession of 12-inches have raised disconcerting questions: Why is one of the 90s most enduring electronic musicians splitting so much time between 80s electro and the sound of his own early-career Analogue Bubblebath efforts? Is he washed up, or just acid-washed? Taking us to the cleaners? As of the sixth, seventh, and eight Analord installments, James seems more TB-303 now than man, twisted and primeval. These insistent, repetitive analogue compositions are almost perversely anachronistic, a robot curled up in the fetal position rather than the conqueror of new colonies we'd once come to expect. The multi-layered beats of Drukqs persist, but the glistening melodies that set apart the Twin's finest work are, after burbling just beneath the surface of some early Analord tracks, all too infrequent in this batch. Much of Analord 6 will be familiar to anyone who's heard its predecessors. ""Batine Acid"" plies rote acid lines with intermittent spookiness, ""Snivel Chew"" adds sawtooth synths and rapid handclaps, and ""2 Analogue Talks"" at least mixes things up with squeaky, high-pitched scales giving way to the monotonous, clock-like donging of what sounds like a horn sample. Standout ""I'm Self Employed"" suggests that whatever James is up to, he's not just going through the motions-- at least not always. Fragile, lonely melodies and countermelodies reminiscent of his ambient works build into a rust-eyed chorus and actually take it somewhere. Analord 7 kicks off with the (deceptively?) straightforward acid-house of ""Lisbon Acid"", which bloops, thumps, fuzzes, squelches, and ultimately meanders for an entire side. The echoey off-key synths of ""Pitcard"" start and stop on a dime, which is better than a nickel (worth more, too!). The ""AFX Acid 04"" evokes almost an acid remix of Spoon's ""I Turn My Camera On"" with its slinky changes and martial pace, before giving way to ominously discordant skarronking. The tracks on Analord 8 are named for computer viruses, likely in an effort to discourage file-sharers. Then again, the pieces might have been so named because a few are among the series' most infectious so far. Awash in disco hi-hats, ""PWSteal.Ldpinch.D"" beckons with the type of decidedly non-digital lust, come-hither bass line, and slightly detuned hooks that a Kylie Minogue could have taken upchart. Blippy ""W32.Deadcode.A"" is almost as good once the bridge arrives like a between-storms rainbow. ""Backdoor.Berbew.Q"", meanwhile, rises and subsides with a burbling bass and choir-like synth chords, and ""Backdoor.Spyboter.A"" unfolds similarly over pings and more handclaps, but neither really goes anywhere. That's the disappointing crux of James's current collection of never-awful but rarely remarkable noodlings.","The continuing acid revival adventures of the Aphex Twin.

The Essential Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb45c0084474cd0c2803/1:1/w_160/642f62f0.jpg,2005-08-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4351-the-essential-michael-jackson/,Sony,"Eight thousand Michael Jackson fans-- the ones in the U.S. that actually bought this collection in its first week of release-- could be wrong, though I think it's more likely that the group outside of those 8K are the ones with the loose screws. After all, a two-disc best-of collection from a performer with more than 150 million records sold worldwide is bound to have better sales numbers than the latest volume of Now That's What I Call Music!. But the majority of those millions were sold years ago, before (most of) the plastic surgeries, the 30-foot statue floating down the Thames, the gold-plated baseball equipment, the crotch grabbing, the ethnic slurs, the baby dangling, and the countless accusations of child molestation. Suffice it to say that any pop capital Michael Jackson accrued during his reign as the self-appointed King of Pop has long been spent. However, as these two discs ably show, his honorarium was, for a time, actually justified. For most folk, Disc One might be more than enough MJ. The disc covers the meat of Jackson's career, starting with the Jackson 5, and ending with the title track from Thriller. Anyone that doesn't know ""ABC"" or ""I Want You Back"" must be deaf, and anyone that doesn't enjoy these songs must be dead. Pitchfork staffer Tom Breihan will be happy to know that ""The Love You Save"" is included-- it's the J5 #1 that never gets any play, and it might be the best of the bunch. Of course, as much as Jackson is all about the finger-snapping funky dance stuff, he's also about the treacly ballad, so instead of ""I'll Be There"", there's ""Got To Be There"", which really shouldn't be anywhere. And then there's ""Ben"", a song about a boy and his homicidal rat that touched the lives of both Crispin Glover and Eddie Vedder. Yay for the skip button, because right after that roadblock comes great unsung tracks from the Jacksons, like ""Blame It On the Boogie"", and the ubiquitous Quincy Jones collaborations that made Jackson a legend. The final 12 tracks of Disc One are comprised with cuts from Off The Wall and Thriller, including all seven Top Ten singles from the latter album. The importance of Thriller can't be understated, musically or otherwise-- 27x platinum in the U.S. alone, ushered in the age of milking albums for all they're worth, helped dimwits at MTV realize that having popular black artists on their nascent network might be a good idea, gave John Landis a chance to do more werewolf stuff-- but it's the Off The Wall tracks that shine brightest. The triple-threat of ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" ""Rock With You"", and ""Off The Wall"" hinted at the effortless pop hopscotch Jackson would execute on the next record. Thriller does manage to make the Beatles and heavy metal (and, um, monster movies) hold hands like BFFs-- no easy feat in the early 1980s, regardless of who's doing it-- but it could take years of distance and brainwashing for ""Beat It"" or ""Billie Jean"" to shake off their played-out flavor. Hearing ""Thriller"" away from the zombie chorus line is interesting, though, if only because one comes to realize that a song about being pursued by 40-eyed behemoths actually made CBS a boatload of cash. Of course, the title track's success came in the wake of a song that goes from a refrain of ""You're just a buffet/ You're a vegetable"" to a coda of tribal chanting, which goes to show how off-the-wall Thriller actually was. In light of what Disc One offers, Disc Two will invariably disappoint, just as the 8x platinum Bad was a disappointment in the wake of the unparalleled success of Thiller. With hindsight, it's hard not to see the songs from Bad in an unflattering light. As Tom B. noted in his write-up regarding the Michael Jackson box-set, this is where all the tics and affectations that people think of when they think of Michael Jackson came to roost-- not five seconds pass without an unwarranted ""shamon"" or ""hee-hee"" or hiccup or ""woo"". While Bad boasted more #1 hits than its predecessor-- ah, the joy of riding coattails-- most of the singles are just lesser versions of Thriller tracks. ""Bad"" is a beat-down ""Beat It"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is a tepid rehash of ""P.Y.T."", and the hamfisted seduction in ""Dirty Diana"" is light years from the alluring ambiguity of ""Billie Jean"". And then there's ""Man in the Mirror"", wherein the King reacquires his taste for schmaltzy sub-""Ben"" balladry, now cutting it with a need to ""make that change"" for the sake of the entire human race. It might be simply a matter of a failed negotiations, but it's no small blessing that ""We Are the World"" is far, far, far away from this collection. Unfortunately, no such boon kept the chirpy and grointastic ""Black Or White"" off the board. That said, the second disc does right by Jackson, culling quality tracks from the sparse smattering of original material that followed That Album, and all the non-musical nonsense that surrounded this music. Without such selectivity, an interested novice would be better served just grabbing Off The Wall and Thriller. Instead, Bad's gorgeous ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" and neglected Dangerous single ""In The Closet"" receive their deserved moment. Even the DOA single from his latest album, ""You Rock My World"", sounds surprisingly spry. Being far removed from that awful video featuring Marlon Brando's corpse and Michael Tucker as Mini-MJ helps, just as getting the hell away from Iman and Eddie Murphy does wonders for ""Remember the Time"". Therein lies the rub of Jackson's career-- as fantastic a performer, songwriter, and singer he is, people at large are going to remember Michael Jackson more for his Wacko Jacko public persona than for his exemplary body of work. Given recent events, the backlash is understandable, but in regards to the actual music being offered here, it's a damn shame.","2xCD career-spanning reminder of why he was once the King of Pop.

Blood Run,Unsane,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90513d19756521397c1/1:1/w_160/27adfced.jpg,2005-08-07 06:00:10,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8386-blood-run/,Relapse,"In 1992, a friend organized an Unsane show at bar in New Jersey, but a blizzard began the night before and lasted until about noon that day, so attendance was sparse. At the time, I was into Jesus Lizard, Big Black, Helmet, Laughing Hyenas, and Swans, so I dodged drifts and got a place in front (not that there was much competition). As my feet thawed (I remember puddles of water), I was blown away by the volumes attained by these three NYC musicians: I lost track of individual songs, but the set was mostly culled from their 1991 Matador debut, the one with a decapitated guy bleeding across a train track. Live, besides the sheer brutality, I was struck by the gnarly, distorted vocals of guitarist Chris Spencer and the chaotic, body-shot drums of Charles Ondras. (Sadly, later the same year, Ondras died of a drug overdose, and was replaced by former Foetus/Swans drummer Vincent Signorelli.) For me, that night was Unsane at its peak, but even after I stopped paying attention, the Lower East Side noise-rock trio kept going (and going). In fact, the band's history is more extensive than one might guess: In 1992, Matador released a compilation of early singles and compilation tracks. In 1993, that label inked its infamous distribution deal with Atlantic, which found Unsane connected to a major label for album three, Total Destruction, produced by Martin Bisi. In 1995, the band signed to Amphetamine Reptile for Scattered, Smothered, and Covered and hooked into a tour with Slayer. After years of intense touring, Unsane released Occupational Hazard in 1998 on Relapse. That same year, Spencer was beaten close to death by four anti-American Viennese thugs while in Austria. He recovered, but the band called it quits in 2000. Now, 13 years after I was introduced to their live rage, Unsane's in my apartment with a collection of new material, their first since Occupational Hazard. Spencer remains on vocals and guitar and Signorelli's still on drums. Original bassist, Peter Shore left in 1994 and his replacement, Dave Curran continues to provide the heavy, often nimble low-end. Blood Run doesn't diverge from the Unsane salad days. Even the gory cover continues the tradition of packaging the work in hyper-saturated crime-scenes. ""Blood Run"" itself is a term Spencer gave for the band's quick moving photo shoots. Because they often occur in borrowed/public spaces, he and his associates set up the shot, pour the the blood, quickly depart wherever it is they're shooting (warehouse, etc.) before the cops come. The new, too-obviously staged pic isn't as creepy as the old stuff, but it does show a naked tattooed girl, i.e. linking it to the whole Suicide Girl thing. (Hey, it's one way to remain current.) The production's crisper than the first two albums, but otherwise, the distorted vocals, drill-sergeant lyrics (""Can't break. Get straight. Too Late. Dead weight""), pummeling drums, bassy bass, and bluesy/sheet-rock guitars could've been recorded a decade ago. Think stripped-down Laughing Hyenas on ""Got It Down"" and ""Recovery"" or Helmet sans Branca name-drop just about anywhere else. There's little variation. Introductory movements or openings fall into different camps-- solo drums, solo guitar, solo bass-- but after that, each piece becomes the same sludgy formulation. Moments of difference: 1) Guest semi-metal guitar solos on ""Hammered Out"" and ""Latch"", and 2) A seven-minute closer, ""Dead Weight"", which introduces more drone and sustain than usual, but quickly falls into line, then ends with the sounds of a subway coming to a stop, perhaps crushing a head. Blood Run offers a visceral kick in small doses. (Try one track and then leave the room for 15 minutes. Repeat.) The purist in me even kinda wants to extend a hand to the boys for sticking to a template so relentlessly. But come on, while Unsane hasn't lost a step, it hasn't gained anything either. And in the end, as in the beginning, the lack of a sneak-attack and attendant shock/awe spells death for a band whose relevance hinges on arriving like a 2 a.m., tooth-chipping sucker punch.","Relapse band returns with its first set of new material since 1998's Occupational Hazard.

Shaded Lodge and Mausoleum,Doleful Lions,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbdc0084474cd0c291b/1:1/w_160/1b81c91d.jpg,2005-08-07 06:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2621-shaded-lodge-and-mausoleum/,Parasol,"While some indie bands, with their impenetrable song structures, vexing lyrics, and contrived wardrobes, practically beckon for a lambasting, Chapel Hill's Doleful Lions aim to purr and meow their way onto your lap in the damned most adorable way possible. For seven years they've Snuffleupagussed themselves into fans' hearts by setting saccharine folk-pop in a lysergic fantasyland of sasquatches, werewolves, and other assorted bugaboos. Yet even at their most far-fetched offerings, the band's only elicited a mere chuckle and slap on the wrist from critics. That's the perk of possessing one of the most soothing lullaby voices this side of Stuart Murdoch, and singer Jonathan Scott knows it. On 2002's Out Like a Lamb, Scott finally cashed in on his stirring voice and keen pop sensibilities by ebbing his New Age fixations and utilizing a full band. For better or worse, Shaded Lodge marks a return to the cauldron for the Lions as studio wizard David Jackson and Scott collaborate to conjure up more kooky things that go bump in the night. However, ""kooky"" for the Lions is hardly an Olivia Tremor Control or even Flaming Lips brand of quirky pop, but rather stripped down Simon and Garfunkel acoustic ditties drenched in reverb and the occasional sound effect. Despite the eerie blips and screeches, Out Like a Lamb is the only thing really haunting this record. The tracklist's split between sprightly indie pop and drowsy, woebegone folk. Opener ""Shame Magic in the Night Galley"" takes a ginger step towards ebullient pop but it's reserved and simplistic sound portends the downcast mood swing to come. ""Watch the Skies / A Boy's Life"" follows the tradition of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" both musically and lyrically, though cumbersome images of Arthurian adventure convolute its message: ""Let's smash the magic wonder window...in the halls of Abel's fault."" I mean, the stagnant melody's uninspiring enough, but who'd actually rally around the credo ""Snuff the mortal candelabra's light""? Luckily tracks like ""Destroyer of the West"" and ""Satanic Blood"" stand as the white knights in this tale. The former features Elliott Smith/Cass McCombs hybrid vocals coupled with jangly guitar almost slow enough to pass as shoegazer. Yeah, ""Satanic Blood"" is another ""Just Like Heaven"" permutation, but Scott's raspy vocals greatly contrasts Robert Smith's, and these days who isn't hitching ersatz Cure tracks to their albums for good measure? After all, immediacy like this makes Scott's seven-minute doldrums somewhat worth the wait. However, while fantastical lyrics and Lord of the Rings settings may buy you time when ideas are lacking, as Scott himself sings, add too much filler and ""the hexagon and necroworm won't wait.""","Soothing lullabies and cuddly pop from Chapel Hill, N.C.-based indie band.

All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra,Electric Light Orchestra,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd10ea9e61561daa761b/1:1/w_160/269a28d7.jpg,2005-08-07 06:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2934-all-over-the-world-the-very-best-of-electric-light-orchestra/,Epic,"The treasure chest of unheard and underappreciated bands must surely be running dry, what with us coming close to two full decades of CD-Age vault-plundering and with multitudes of internet sites cratedigging for the next forgotten masterpiece. So rather than continuing to look for those artists that sold 11 copies of their wildly influential debut record before imploding, perhaps we should be re-appraising bands that have been right under our nose all the time, almost annoyingly so. Electric Light Orchestra is one of those ubiquitous bands that could be due for a second glance, a concept that briefly gained some momentum when ""Mr. Blue Sky"" all of a sudden became mandatory accompaniment for Charlie Kaufman-scripted films. However, a number of elements appear to be aligned against any sort of serious, non-kitschy ELO revival: 1) That absurd (yet appropriate!) name, 2) The incredibly Muppetish appearance of frontman Jeff Lynne, and 3) The group's all too easily parodied and carbon-dated sound, with its liberal use of falsetto and classical strings. But the things that so firmly attach ELO to a particular time in music history (the 1970s) are also the things that make them so uniquely great. ELO existed at a point in music history where I was brought up to imagine the armies of rock and disco locked in a mortal battle like the Cubs and Cardinals, wherein the two flavors were mutually exclusive to apartheid-like extremes thanks to fun things like racism and homophobia and fear of keyboards. New- ave compilations have somewhat dissuaded me of that notion, but the field of what is now classic rock most assuredly remained a genre that surely treated the influx of disco's dance beats and string arrangements as straight heresy, and it was against this backdrop that ELO made its heroic stand. Of course, Lynne's bold mixing of the disco and the rock seems almost accidental in retrospect-- books tell me that disco didn't peak until the mid-seventies, while the self-titled first ELO album hit stores in 1971, so the chronology doesn't quite match up. The original vision for the Electric Light Orchestra was rather coarsely telegraphed by their name: a merger of pop, rock, and classical music that yielded some pretty embarrassing early moments (including the Beethoven/Berry mash-up of ""Roll Over Beethoven"", not included here) and some pretty great ones (rock + opera aria = ""Rockaria!"", included). Early on, Lynne and co. made music that was sky-high on excess, drunk on the ambitious precedent set by the Beatles and the fact that, wow, studios have that many tracks to work with now?! So it was pretty much serendipity when, by the middle of the decade, classical-sounding strings were suddenly a hot property thanks the burgeoning disco scene, Walter Murphy's ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" even echoing ELO's own attempts to update old Ludwig van. To Lynne's credit, he didn't follow his rock peers in mocking the new dance sound, but rather embraced the accidental resemblance, recording the group's best singles (""Evil Woman"", ""Living Thing"", ""Telephone Line"") in an extravagant and non-condescending fusion of disco and rock. Only the Bee Gees were able to ride the wave of fashion more profitably, though each band's success should hardly be held against them...there's a reason why both are still heard on the radio incessantly. All of the above makes ELO an excellent greatest hits band, as there's not a whole lot to be found in the deep cuts of albums like Out of the Blue and Face the Music. It's appropriate then, that there are numerous ELO greatest hits sets already available, with All Over the World only the latest entry. Truthfully, it's fairly interchangeable with the other comps already on the market, covering the band's less-rewarding backbeat-obsessed early period through the heady disco days described above through to the proggier late-70s work which birthed ""Mr. Blue Sky"" (and it's lesser-known sibling ""The Diary of Horace Wimp""). Only two reasonable complaints can be lodged: the baffling omission of choice slow jam ""Can't Get It Out of My Head"", and the pointless just-barely-two-discs length. It's a bit difficult to argue the cred-bolstering relevance of ELO in 2005, given that it's practically impossible to find a current band that sounds anything like Mr. Lynne's studio concoction. Pushed to the wall, I'd probably argue for the importance of ELO in paving the way for what we're now referring to as ""hyperprog,"" the condition of idea/instrument abundance employed by bands like The Fiery Furnaces and Head of Femur. Yet none of these bands possess that essential quality of pure excess that sets ELO apart, that coke-infused sheen I associate with the 70s thanks to P.T. Anderson films and VH-1 documentaries. Based off this second-hand knowledge, Electric Light Orchestra are about as perfect a sound representation of that era as you're bound to find...and that makes them a band worth remembering.","2xCD best-of collection provides an opportunity to reasses the career of Jeff Lynne's classic pop outfit.

"More Than Music, Vol. 1",Dipset,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbc13d197565213b168/1:1/w_160/29c4a4cb.jpg,2005-08-07 06:00:07,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2620-more-than-music-vol-1/,Koch,"If, as crew mixtapes go, Dipset's new More Than Music, Vol. 1 is a cut above the typical riffraff, does that mean the Dipset emcee is superior to his counterpart in Ruff Ryders or G-Unit? No, it's a package deal. Even with three-four hitters Cam'ron and LaRon ""Juelz Santana"" Jones skewing the group average, Dipset has its acknowledged bench players. But with most products of its kind coming off as second-stringer pity parties, More Than Music is generously well apportioned, complete with assiduous rapping, pricey beats, and packaging that wasn't printed on a cousin's Epson. For New York crews, mere proliferation isn't good enough; world domination is more their speed. Dipset has similarly high-minded ambitions, and if you've missed its highfalutin talk of spearheading a new Harlem Renaissance, the title track clarifies: Amid thunder claps, a sermoning voice announces, ""In the beginning of this movement, it was all a dream. The passion...the dedication...the persistence...TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS."" Talk of movements is hardly cutting edge, but Dipset infuses even its fluffiest shit-talkin' with ungodly energy. To hear the opener's stony, swelling strings is to feel the world shifting beneath your feet. But how much of this is just ""Final Countdown"" quixotism? Depending on who's blogging, a lot or more. Is Dipset the most galvanizing crew in hip hop, or another peacocking cadre? Yes. All that chest puffing is part of what makes them so gripping. Juelz Santana calls himself ""crack in the flesh"" and his best tracks make you believe it. Cam specializes in corner talk, but his is a unique breed, full of doublespeak, circular logic, and fantastical imagery. He scampers around boilerplate topics like a jester, abstracting and obstructing like he's too smart to help it. Even those apprenticed to the head honchos are coming up strong. So, cardboard moralists dismiss at will, but Dipset outstrips the species norm by a crosstown block. Above all, Dippers be thuggin' to the sound of Dips-- all razoring strings, airtight beats, and clenched-teeth deliveries. That sound is a shot of stanozolol wherever MTM threatens to wane, which is often enough. Believe it or not, at 67 minutes, the album has some soft spots. But the triumphant opener ""Dipset Symphony"" is not such a spot. More rag than symphony, the track rides a rickety piano roll while 16's fly by at a frantic clip. (Featuring no fewer than six emcees and the hypeman's bloviating inside of three minutes, it's the album's busiest number.) No one quite steals the show, but Santana christens the melee (""All eyes on the honorable. Who?/ Dipset, back to the grill again. Live at the barbeque.""). Among the understudies, J.R. Writer is my frontrunner to crash the big leagues. He takes ""You Make Me Say"", a bittersweet, 6/8-feel beat from Heatmakerz, and delivers Cam-lean verses in his own, edgier voice (""See you draped in designer wear/ Nice clothes/ Like those?/ I'll take you to buy a pair/ Where? That's Paris to Milan/ Fill your bag up with Vuitton/ You the baddest and the bomb/ Understand, I'm a rapper with some charm/ Don't worry 'bout the little groupies grabbing on my arm""). Close behind Writer may be recent Dipset newie (and charter female member) Jha Jha. She spits on the immaculate ""So Gangsta"", which samples Aalon Butler's 1977 semi-classic ""Rock and Roll Gangster"".

Weird Tales of the Ramones,Ramones,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20aea9e61561daa493d/1:1/w_160/384d1223.gif,2005-08-07 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6683-weird-tales-of-the-ramones/,Rhino,"The tale of the Ramones is as sad as it is weird. Four guys from down-and-out Queens adopted a common surname and the same juvenile delinquent uniforms as they blasted short, simple, sublime pop songs from cramped stages. Eventually some of the brothers-in-arms became bitter enemies. When Johnny stole his girl, Joey didn't fight him at the lockers, but wrote ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"". Therein lies a large part of the Ramones' charm: they made rock music with bored kids in mind, with short-attention-span song lengths, blunt guitar riffs, and unsophisticated lyrics. The band was self-aware, sure, but the Ramones always seemed genuinely invested in what might seem like the shallowest eddies of pop culture. In the process, they tapped the essence of rock music in its purest form. Unfortunately, the movement the Ramones helped to jumpstart quickly got away from them, turning their practiced naivete into impractical nihilism. Their desperate hopes for mainstream popularity, which showed through in their professionalism and dogged work ethic, were dashed when the Sex Pistols made the new style a four-letter word. Instead of taking over the airwaves, they became a cult band, but always seemed too big for such a diminutive label. As their contemporaries imploded or exploded, the Ramones maintained a surprisingly consistent pace, continuously putting out albums but refusing to expand their sound too far beyond the template they established on their self-titled debut. The Ramones were the anti-Beatles: they resisted musical growth and maturation, and we're all the better for it. Collecting 85 songs from 20 years, Weird Tales of the Ramones, which Johnny helped to curate, reveals just how little the Ramones' sound changed and just how little that mattered. Every song, from the first track (""Blitzkrieg Bop"") through the last (""R.A.M.O.N.E.S.""), shares the same basic elements: sharp, fast guitar riffs; punchy momentum; driving tempos; and handclaps or sha-la-las or some other nod to pre-album rock pop music. The Ramones' aesthetic has become such common currency, though, that it's easy to forget how raw they could sound, how tough and tender, how just a handful of elements could be recast in infinite variations. If they were reluctant to evolve their sound, the Ramones constantly tested its flexibility. Phil Spector gives ""Do You Remember Rock and Roll Radio?"" the wall-of-sound treatment, and ""Rock and Roll High School"" is basically a revved-up Beach Boys song. In the 1990s, they covered Tom Waits (""I Don't Want to Grow Up""), the Who (""Substitute""), the Amboy Dukes (""Journey to the Center of the Mind""), and Love (""7 and 7 Is""), but best of all is their webslingin' version of the original ""Spider-Man"" theme, which originally appeared on the 1995 compilation Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits. Like most box sets these days, Weird Tales is a multimedia package. A DVD contains all of their videos, most of them embedded in a 1990 program that includes short interviews with contemporaries (Debbie Harry, Tina Weymouth) and fans (former New York Yankees pitcher Dave Righetti, who doesn't seem to get the band). Most of the videos are just silly enough to fit with the Ramones' particular aesthetic, although ""Something to Believe In"" is a hilarious parody of stuffy mid-80s USA for Africa self-seriousness. But this box set's real attraction, aside from the music, is the packaging, which includes a thick comic book inked by several artists including Mary Fleener (Life of the Party), Bill Griffith (Zippy the Pinhead), John Holmstrom (two Ramones album covers), and Sergio Aragones, whose work in Mad magazine was influential to the Ramones specifically and to early New York punk in general. Despite the reliance on the questionable narrative that the Ramones destroyed synthetic disco and bloated arena rock (which is truer as a personal listener reaction than as rock history), the comics avoid self-serving remembrances by fawning devotees and fussy rock-critic exegeses that often sanitize subversive artists. These strips are informative, imaginative, and-- oh yeah-- pretty damn funny. Moreover, this art form is the inky equivalent of the Ramones' music and image-- their scuffed Chucks, ripped jeans, Mickey Mouse t-shirts, and outlandish haircuts-- and reinforces their aura of permanent adolescence. This sort of inspired cleverness keeps Weird Tales from eulogizing the Ramones or, worse, explaining away their mighty mysteries. And perhaps their lack of mainstream success during their lifetimes ensured a larger and posthumous triumph: in the thirty years since their debut, several generations of listeners have connected with their music in a very personal way without the interference of institutionalized nostalgia. Weird Tales makes it possible for future generations of pinheads, dropouts, glue-sniffers, brats, cretins, mama's boys, and punk-punk-punk rockers to discover the Ramones as if for the very first time. Gabba gabba hey!","The oft-compiled punk legends get the deluxe box treatment on this nearly flawless 85-track, 3xCD/DVD/comic book package from Rhino.

Often Lie,Statistics,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6505e6ef95969320cdf/1:1/w_160/0d9037d5.jpg,2005-08-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7731-often-lie/,Jade Tree,"Jimmy Eat World once sang, ""Do you feel bad like I feel bad?"" Nobody does. I don't. You don't. Desaparecidos co-songwriter and Statistics one-man-band Denver Dalley does. Words fail (""I'm dying to be living""). They fail early (""You could say we're changing formats"" on opener ""Final Broadcast""). They fail often (""Through our cell phones we shout""; ""Who are you holding when you're sleeping next to me?""; ""Ignorance was so blissful""). They fail spectacularly (""This distance is getting tough""), and best of all they're posted. Jimmy Eat World once sang, ""All I need is just to hear a song I know."" Likewise, when Denver Dalley feels bad he sings songs about the way songs make kids feel rather than about firsthand feelings. On Statistics' sophomore LP, Often Lie, Denver Dalley feels like this: ""Lately, songs don't sound the same/ As they did/ The verses sound written just for me/ And the chorus comes back/ Begging to be heard/ Over and over, again and again/ Over and over, again"" and so and on. Now, I still hear ""Rubber Ring"" and think of Morrissey kindly, even if ""The Hook"" brought Blues Traveler back for another run around VH-1. But the snake has eaten its tail, folks: Singing about the power of song doesn't necessarily make a song powerful. What makes a song powerful? Why, simple guitars that start quiet and grow loud, of course. On ""Final Broadcast"", ""No Promises"", ""At the End"", and ""10/22"", Dalley has those in spades-- in clubs too, check local listings! In addition to powerful this makes the songs emotional, which may be why Statistics sound like Sunny Day Real Estate and the aforementioned Jimmy Eat World (and the unmentioned Mineral Jealous Gloria Waxwing Theory). ""A Foreword"" jumps from Sunny Day's murky ""In Circles"" to Weezer's spirited ""Suzanne"". ""Begging to Be Heard"" has the chimey guitar lead thing from Smashing Pumpkins' ""Today"" or Statistics' ""Grass Is Always Greener"", but it doesn't get all distorted like-- wait, there it goes. The big echoey half-falsetto call/response chorus of ""No Promises"" kills in Omaha! Dramatic drum fill, wham pow boomshaka. Statistics aren't ""emo"", because that trip was all about honesty and Statistics Often Lie-- nice one. Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum once wrote, ""Get me Tamborello!"" That was about another Desaparecidos co-songwriter. Well, Dalley does things himself. Along with shimmery synths, aimless IDM blips, beats, bleats and nauseating buzzes dot the productions-- particularly ""By(e) Now"" (almost as clever as last album's ""Chairman of the Bored"")-- like a post-Postal Service pox. Statistics' debut was heavy on messy experimental tracks, but now Dalley mostly focuses on the songs.","One-man-band project of Desaparecidos co-songwriter Denver Dalley.

The Back Room,Editors,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0f5e6ef95969322f98/1:1/w_160/5b11fe8f.jpg,2005-08-04 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2933-the-back-room/,Kitchenware,"The Editors debut is influenced by the same fashionable 1980s English bands heard in scores of recent indie groups, but they've gained measurable success in their native country of England with singles like ""Bullets"" and ""Munich"". In modern terms, Editors aren't the conspicuous nostalgia of the Stills, but they don't quite have the jittery bluster of bands like Maxímo Park, lying somewhere in between the two. The Back Room puts its best foot forward with the first three tracks, played with more than enough verve to compensate for their limited borrowed palette. Vocalist/guitarist Tom Smith sings in a forceful but wavering voice, like Paul Banks on the edge of distraction. On opener ""Lights"", the guitars move from standard jangle and reverb-heavy single notes into punctuating, echo-laden scrapes, recalling the work of U2's the Edge. Editors occasionally match a catchy vocal line with an energetic performance, like the speedy picking and memorable vocals in the chorus of ""Munich"" or the insistent rhythm of ""Blood"". More often, it's the performance that overshadows the minimal melody. When the tempos slow, the album gets ponderous, and The Back Room puts three melodramatic slow songs smack dab in its center. ""Fall"" features listless strumming over stark bass and drums, while Smith's drawn out-phrasing leads the band to slow-burning catharsis-- truth be told, Editors sounds more like Interpol than anyone else, and their mockingbird act betrays a lack of confidence needed to pull off their tortured posturing. Quick tempos return on ""Fingers in the Factory"", one of the disc's strongest performances, but momentum has been lost and the remaining songs are aimless. ""Fingers in the Factory"" is most memorable for it's stomping chorus, with voice drums and guitars all hitting the same staccato notes, but the same gimmick falls flat elsewhere. ""Bullets"" relies on forceful repetition for a hook, belting ""you don't need this disease"" over and over while the band cranks it up, but the dynamics are lost without a melody. Editors sound like an earnest rock band who grew up loving the same bands as the current batch of revivalists, but beyond the workmanlike interpretations of their heroes, it's hard to swallow. Editors often imitate bands with dramatic vocalists like Ian Curtis or Ian McCulloch, but the best moments on The Back Room aren't the theatrical ones-- it's when the four of them are playing and discovering their own chemistry.","Debut LP from UK Interpol soundalikes.

Rescue Through Tomahawk,Alaska!,by: Stephen M.

Alaskan! bassist Russ Pollard played in Lou Barlow's post-Dino group Sebadoh from 1997 until 2000, and singer/guitarist Imaad Wasif toured with another Barlow project, the Folk Implosion. But the exclamation point-enhanced trio isn't really an oddball choice for touring buddies: while they don't share Dinosaur Jr's penchant for messy, genre-busting musical chaos, alaska! has a similar potential for controlled noise: at its best the trio churn guitar-grinfing maelstroms that sound barely contained. That potential, unfortunately, is not entirely realized on their second album, Rescue Through Tomahawk, which sounds all too contained. Musically, it's frenetic in all the right ways: The rhythm section-- Pollard and former Red Aunts drummer Lesley Ishino-- moves agilely across a range of dynamics, from quiet to loud on the gradually building ""Surrender"", from slow to fast on ""The Light"", from gentle to harsh on almost every track. Throughout Rescue Through Tomahawk Imaad Wasif's guitar weaves menacingly, adding a darkly hesitant intro to ""Through the Years"" and a triumphant coda to ""Surrender"". When alaska! plays like an instrumental band, it proves surprisingly formidable: a little subtler than Kinski, a little less abstract than the equally exclamatory Godspeed You! Black Emperor, a little less brutal than Mogwai. However, alaska! isn't an instrumental band; lyrics and vocals dominate their songs. Wasif proves a perfectly adequate singer: his gravelly voice tends toward expressive overenunciation and to-the-rafters projection, and his trippily oblique lyrics lean more toward eerie evocativeness than outright clarity. But really, vocals and lyrics are the least interesting aspects of this album; Wasif doesn't say anything on Rescue Through Tomahawk that the band doesn't state more clearly, concisely, and compellingly through its wound-tight sound, its clockwork interplay of instruments, and the friction between styles and musical elements. The songs seem hemmed in by their devotion to Wasif's lyrical structures, and often the attempt to subvert them creates some intriguingly, if unintentionally, tense moments. Pollard kicks out a bassline on ""Real Is Your Control"" that bounces like French pop, and it gives the song an unexpected punch. The guitar solo on ""A Fury of Trees"" plays like an outro, at least until Wasif comes in again with one last verse, but really, the frenetic momentum sounds like the song's one true reason for being. Likewise, most of these songs sound somehow clipped, like they want to cut loose and stretch and sprawl well beyond their imposed limitations.","On the band's second album the songs seem hemmed in by their devotion to lyrical structure, often creating intriguingly, if unintentionally, tense moments.

The Golden Morning Breaks,Colleen,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f2c0084474cd0c0aaf/1:1/w_160/0ba85923.jpg,2005-08-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1744-the-golden-morning-breaks/,Leaf,"When we describe records to you, we tend to talk about the other records they resemble, the genres they relate to, and the sorts of people who might listen to them: One band sounds like Joy Division, another has something to do with house music, another is for metal kids. Talk about The Golden Morning Breaks, though, and you'll find yourself stuck talking about nothing more abstract or general than the instruments used to make these sounds-- the bells and the proto-cellos, the cathedral ambience, and the 19th century glass glockenspiel. And sure, a lot of albums are all about sound. But what sets this one apart is how natural it is about that agenda: This is the rare variety of abstracted, post-electronic New-Music recording that's almost entirely its own creature. (Sounds like? Sounds like beautiful bells!) On Colleen's last album, Cécile Schott crafted the same delicate drifts from ghostly samples and found sounds, but that just kept it all rooted in our common vocabulary of German sound artists and laptop soundscapers. With this album, she's left sampling behind entirely, crafting elegant, barely-there compositions from the pure timbres of instruments old and, well, old; will it surprise anyone that the album's title comes from the work of a 17th century lute virtuoso? So maybe you get something like Fennesz unplugged, or the Georgian-era chamber version of Kompakt's Pop Ambient discs-- but then maybe you don't. Where your laptop dreamers turn their attention to the crackles and the staticky thunderstorms that hover around their music, Schott composes; the incredible ""Summer Water"" spends most of its time pushing strings into ever-so-slightly different arrangements, each new interval shading new colors onto the looping lute figure in the center. And where electronic ambience fills the stereo spectrum with one immersive swell of sound, Colleen sits closer to Brian Eno's original vision of it-- she's interested in the way these instruments can play delicate harmonic figures without ever gathering them up into linear form. Funnily enough, it's her most organized pieces that are both the most unique and the easiest to like; it's when she weaves farthest out into the abstract and the formless that she starts to sound most like something you've heard elsewhere. But only 15% of your brain is following what the instruments are playing. The other 85% is soaking in the pure sound of their reverberations-- the secret-garden chime of ""The Heart Harmonicon"", the harbor-spanning organ of ""The Happy Sea"", the rounded pluck of the lute and the pearly fog that drifts behind it. The strange part is that Schott's all-natural recordings and endlessly-pretty harmonic shifts make this album far more accessible than you'd ever dream; PC technicians rarely get this musically hospitable, and I'm not sure who on the modern-composition New Music side gets quite this relaxed and generous. (I'm not sure which of them would put a fairy-nuzzling unicorn on an album cover, either.) Oh, it's still abstract. Even if you love it, you may struggle to find the appropriate moments to really spend with it-- how much time do you set aside each week to sit quietly with your eyes closed and think about all the different qualities of light you could imagine when you were a child? And if you're not particularly inclined to that beautiful pure-sound formlessness, Colleen's moves in the opposite direction still might not make this much more than some glorious wallpaper-- not the worst role, but not the best Colleen can take. Because at its most effective, this album is kinda everything it should be, and everything we should ask: Something simple, beautiful, and coherent, something that feels remarkably imaginative but entirely unpremeditated. If I didn't have bills to pay and a kitchen to clean, I'd be all over it.","On her latest Leaf release, Cécile Schott leaves sampling behind entirely, crafting elegant, barely-there compositions from the pure timbres of mostly old instruments.

Plat du Jour,Matthew Herbert,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0bfc0084474cd0c3229/1:1/w_160/a296fd24.jpg,2005-08-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3836-plat-du-jour/,Accidental,"In 2001, Matthew Herbert released The Mechanics of Deconstruction under his Radio Boy moniker. Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that Herbert found objectionable. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". The Mechanics of Deconstruction was a curious artifact, moving Herbert's hypercritical pop art into a more overt realm, and, best of all, it was a free download. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of Herbert's anti-corporate rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of Herbert's genius with sampling and arrangement. The fire inside that motivated Herbert to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one Frappucino-- still burns. Plat du Jour shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the critical guns are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, again, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso. With Herbert, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to Plat du Jour five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive coops of terrified chickens are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act. The songs that work best are faster and let Herbert indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's weird noises coalesce beautifully into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with its title and theme, as it sounds like something Tim Burton might've incorporated into his film of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of menace lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as funky as a package of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!"" Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what Herbert is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? I've read Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, McDonald's or otherwise, in three or four years (though the Schlosser book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and Herbert has done a lot better.","As he did on The Mechanics of Deconstruction, recorded under his Radio Boy moniker, Herbert trains his methods, arrangements, and critical guns on global corporations, specifically the food industry.

The DNA Will Have Its Say EP,Some Girls,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b8c0084474cd0c0a21/1:1/w_160/d247a905.jpg,2005-08-03 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7824-the-dna-will-have-its-say-ep/,Three-One-G,"Some Girls have made it pretty simple for us: either you currently have space in your life for pure-grain, 50-second hardcore shots with titles like ""Nazi Rodeo"" or ""Don't Hate Me Just 'Cause I Hate You"", or else you don't. Luckily, with The DNA Will Have Its Say you won't need to clear much room at all, as one can blast through these seven tracks in roughly the time it takes to reheat a medium-sized burrito. These may surely come to be cherished minutes for tradition-bound punk zealots-- and as useful talons as any for those of us with the occasional itch-- but for listeners intent on originality or (not to put too fine a point on it) traceable musical progress, Some Girls sound only too happy to spit upon your daydreams. Arising from the always-fertile (and cross-bred) San Diego scene, Some Girls form a sort of hardcore supergroup, drawing membership from the ranks of several generally more innovative acts like the Locust, Give Up the Ghost, and Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower. On The DNA the group has, if anything, amplified the ferocity present on the minute-long screeds of their 2003 LP All My Friends Are Going Death, and it's with a fundamentalist fervor that they pare their textbook retro-punk down to its rabid core. Needless to say, the brief running time of these tracks virtually eliminates the possibility of any instrumental tangents or digressions, and each winds up carrying less than one percent body fat on its sinewy frame. Fortified by Justin Pearson's distorted bass and the frantic, buried-alive vocals of Wes Eisold, tracks like the quaintly titled opener ""I Need Drugs"" bear some resemblance to the punishing experimental noise of Lightning Bolt. But the hammering Dr. Know (ca.'82) power chords of guitarists Rob Moran and Chuck Rowell wrap these songs in decidedly familiar casings, and the group sounds altogether too content to blithely (albeit rowdily) animate all of hardcore's toastiest chestnuts. The Yeah Yeah Yeah's Karen O makes a cameo on the headlong title track, although her Punk Everywoman shriek is so generic that unless you're sitting on FBI-caliber voice recognition software you're probably gonna have to take their word for it. Her presence here appears to be an oblique nod to a wider punk marketplace, one that's amplified by Some Girls' recent signing with Epitaph. And though there is some delight in the thought of these guys unchaining their vicious arch-nihilism onto the broader unsuspecting public, one can't help but wish that Some Girls exhibited more ambition to blow minds rather than simply chopping heads.","Hardcore band enlists Karen O for a track on its latest EP.

Keystroke One,ElekTro4,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0dabf31b7dc7155e68/1:1/w_160/6423cdfc.jpg,2005-08-03 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2932-keystroke-one/,Bully,"Really, it was inevitable. Last night I was playing ElekTro4's debut LP, Keystroke One, at the coffee shop where I work. I noticed a bespectacled grad student tapping his Pumas to the languid cadences of ElekTro4's fluid basslines, splashy drums, jazzy breaks, and hip-hop vocal samples and cuts. As he approached the counter for a refill, I could see the fated question massing upon his lips like a thunderhead. Then the storm broke as he gestured vaguely upward, toward the music: ""Is this DJ Shadow?"" A million pleasant but unexceptional instrumental hip-hop records has been DJ Shadow's uneasy legacy, and while Keystroke One leans into the more vivid end of the spectrum, forgoing some modern instrumental rap's fixation on boringly beautiful drones in favor of sharp, smart urban landscaping, it feels as if Y2K never happened. ElekTro4 is still partying like it's 1999, or maybe even 1995, and heads everywhere are suddenly remembering how much they dug Mr. Scruff back in the day. The problem with this sort of music (we used to call it trip-hop) in the here and now is that the two main things that made it sound hot in the '90s-- its newness and its technological advances-- are obsolete. Progress is a bitch. Still, it's good audio wallpaper if not an attention magnet, and the execution is wicked sharp. The album is divided into two movements, the first of which is ""Portrait of the City"". This is where ElekTro4 does that ""rendering the city as grimy crucible of humanity"" thang, incorporating city sounds like hissing train doors into stark horn breaks and clipped drum patterns, and on a recent trip to Brooklyn, it flowed just fine with the graffiti-splashed labyrinth of Williamsburg. Sixtoo's crisp production is a boon to this gusty urban melodrama, and on tracks like ""Chasin' Trains"", the top-heavy live drums steal the show from the sparse instrumental track, while ""Jaywalking"" relies more on vocal samples to shape its ominous pulse: Ghostface licking shots at 14-karat gold slum computer wizards &c.; Part two, ""The Suicide Suite"", backs off from hip-hop a bit for a more eclectic metropolitan survey, from the morphing dub plate ""Three Views of a Secret"", to the Latin syncopation of ""Searching for Answers"", to the indie-folksy trills and surges of ""The Explain Nation"" and ""A House with no Mirrors"". Overall, Keystroke One is another fine and evocatively grainy snapshot of the city in a photo album already threatening to sunder its bindings.","Post-Shadow instrumental hip-hop features the requisite fluid basslines, splashy drums, and jazzy breaks.

Man-Made,Teenage Fanclub,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74713d197565213939b/1:1/w_160/cfd55bf8.jpg,2005-08-03 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7957-man-made/,Merge,"Scotland's Teenage Fanclub are the standard-bearers of modern power pop. Eight albums into their career, no one else comes close to their mastery of the genre, and when you think about it, the pieces for their run of remarkably consistent albums were in place from the beginning. The band has three accomplished songwriters whose voices blended as though nature intended it; what it lacked is a sense of adventurous experimentation, and as such, their discography is consistent almost to a fault, always good but never surprising or amazing. It's possible that the band felt the need for a bit of a shake-up when it came time to record Man-Made, and they traveled to Chicago to record with John McEntire at his Soma Electronic Music Studio. The change of venue and the choice of McEntire are the kinds of moves that could precipitate real change in a band's sound, but as it turns out the record is full of the same intensely classicist power pop that's filled every Teenage Fanclub album. McEntire's influence is felt keenly on the edges of the music, though, in the textures of the guitars and bass and in the injection of a host of buzzing and burbling keyboards low in the mix. So while it's not a reinvention, the production does bring in a subtle infusion of the kind of energy and youthful vigor that was missing from recent outings like Howdy! and Songs from Northern Britain and makes Man-Made possibly the band's best outing since 1992's near-masterpiece Bandwagonesque. The tracklist is split amongst four songs each from Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond McGinley. Blake's finest is opener ""It's All in My Mind"", which features the band's trademark gentle harmonies through a monster hook that counter-intuitively pulls back from the verse. Francis MacDonald's drums give the song an insistent beat while buzzing organ and e-bowed guitar quietly mingle in the background to lend the sound a little extra punch. Blake's ""Slow Fade"" is an invigorating nod to the swifter tempos and louder volumes of the band's early-90s salad days, whipping by in less than two minutes and including a spry if somewhat tuneless guitar solo. Love's ""Time Stops"" benefits from well-placed, almost inaudible pizzicato strings in the pensive verses and floats by on a buoyant rhythm full of richly recorded drums and artful piano accents. McEntire's peculiar talent for recording basslines is on full view on McGinley's ""Nowhere"", which rides and especially nice one in its harmony-soaked verses. The vocals aren't the only thing harmonized on ""Feel"", a song that bursts out of the gate with doubled lead guitar and rides a loose groove the relies on a sparse piano part for a lot of its motion. Man-Made ultimately sounds exactly like you'd expect a Teenage Fanclub album to sound, but with just enough extra to make it feel new again. It's unlikely at this point that any of their fans would want them to completely overhaul their approach anyhow, and indeed those fans are treated to the band's best collection of songs in more than a decade here. The uninitiated shouldn't skip over Bandwagonesque for this, but fans of both Teenage Fanclub and power pop in general will be very pleased with this.","Another consistent, quality LP from Scotland's three-headed power-pop songwriting team.

Funkadelic / Free Your Mind / Maggot Brain / America Eats Its Young,Funkadelic,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbbabf31b7dc7155ff7/1:1/w_160/3d32e420.jpg,2005-08-03 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11739-funkadelic-free-your-mind-maggot-brain-america-eats-its-young/,WestboundWestbound,"Funkadelic, arguably the greatest ""black rock"" band ever...Actually, strike that, they are far and away the best black rock band ever. In fact, screw everything, they're one of the greatest rock bands period, up there with any classic rock dinosaur you care to name. And though it's tempting to launch an essay on the racism of rock radio-- or rock journalism for that matter-- I'll stick to the band. Even as they're revered as legends and purveyors of the some of the best funk of the 70s, I've read relatively few accounts on their greatness as a pure rock band. But they had it all: great players, great singers, a great look, a great concept, actual hits, great albums, great drugs, freaky sex, disputes over money-- everything Led Zeppelin (or Spinal Tap) taught us was necessary to make the world's greatest rock music. They started small, backing up ringleader George Clinton's Parliaments in the late 60s. When Clinton got into arguments with his label Revilot over money and rights, he decided to start recording his backup band instead, using the original Parliaments singers (Clinton, Ray Davis, Clarence ""Fuzzy"" Haskins-- and come on, dude's name is ""Fuzzy""-- Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas) as ""guests."" Guitarists Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross, bassist Billy Nelson, drummer Tiki Fulwood, and eventually, master keyboardist Bernie Worrell were the band that would turn this fairly traditional soul group into the intense live act that wowed Detroit's Westbound Records head Armen Boladian. He signed them, and from the get-go, their music cut through genres and money bullshit like neither had ever existed. Never mind that half the band quit and came back again during recording sessions for their first record, Funkadelic was destined for greatness. Ace's reissues of the band's Westbound catalog is long overdue-- they sound a world better than the terribly mastered original CD pressings, and contain a wealth of bonus tracks, alternate mixes, and liner notes. Funkadelic from 1970 was a bomb dropped all over rock and soul. No matter Hendrix, no matter James Brown, no matter the MC5, nobody had ever heard anything like this. This music was slower than sludge, dirtier than the ""raw funk"" Herb ""Sparky"" Sparkman talks about in ""Music For My Mother"". It was a great big fucking mess, and a lot of people didn't know what to make of it. I remember reading a Rolling Stone review from the time that ended with ""who needs this shit?"" and a writer from the Blues & Soul 'zine from a year later admitted, ""Funkadelic has never been one of my favorite R&B; acts"". Still, the record sold (peaking at #16 on the Soul LPs chart), and planted the seed of a cult worship that would balloon in the latter half of the decade, making the P-Funk enterprise the most successful soul act on the planet. ""Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?"" started out with the sound of Clinton's wet mouth and the best ever opening line for an album: ""If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions."" When the beat hits with Hazel's guitar line, there can be no doubt that Funkadelic were without peer as far as this stuff was concerned. This stuff-- hell, tunes like ""Mommy"" and ""Good Old Music"" are slams to the gut as powerful as anything Zep ever did, and with beats to spare. ""Music For My Mother"" is like a Southern myth, detailing a loner's travels through ""Keep Runnin' Mississippi"", hearing music he thought long dead, yet getting trapped by its sticky black allure. ""What Is Soul?"" drops more classic lines (""soul is a hamhock in your cornflakes,"" ""Soul is chitlins foo young,"" ""soul is a joint rolled in toilet paper"") in seven minutes than most bands muster up in a career. Bonus tracks like the tight instrumental ""As Good As I Can Feel"" and several single versions of album cuts make this album one of the most indispensable of all indispensable Funkadelic records. Even as Funkadelic was an inspired statement, it wasn't exactly a coherent one, especially as most of the band had quit and come back again during the recording sessions. Their second record, 1971's Free Your Mind was the first (of only two) records done by the core unit from start to finish-- albeit, according to Clinton, one recorded in the span of a single day, while everyone was tripping. Compared to the debut, it's a lot more ""rock"" and a little less ""soul."" The opening track ""Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow"" was like a Sly Stone jam gone haywire, with fuzzed out guitar and bass, distorto-organ, and spoken, chanted or otherwise freaked vox appearing all over the mix. ""Friday Night, August 14th"", ""Funky Dollar Bill"", and ""I Wanna Know If It's Good to You"" were a bit tighter, and a lot harder. ""Funky Dollar Bill"" features another down-home-on-a-porch-and-an-amp-with-probably-some-pot-and-other-things guitar riff from Hazel and Clinton and company sounding completely fucked up and screaming out at you from the depths of the stereo on lines like ""you don't buy a life, you live a life, a father learns much too late-- HE WAS A-NEVER HOME!!"" ""Euology and Light"" is like a lysergic Lord's Prayer, replete with backwards choir. The bonus track ""Fish, Chips and Sweat"" is again reminiscent of Sly, but in his ""Dance to the Music"" guise, and is suitably celebratory, even as the mix distorts the tape. And then they got serious: Maggot Brain, released in the July of the same year, is the peak of the Funkadelic experience. The songs jam harder, the way out stuff is way fucking out there. Seriously, how many dimensions is Hazel traveling through on the instrumental title cut? His 10-minute guitar soliloquy is a spiraling model of the blues filtered through a psychedelic lens, and almost single-handedly places him in a realm with Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton as one of the great classic rock guitarists. But it got better: ""Super Stupid"" was the tale of a dumbass junkie set to a tune Black Sabbath would have been proud of; ""Hit It And Quit It"" is a funk anthem where keyboardist Worrell gets his licks in and the beat turns around a dozen times before we hit the chorus; ""Can You Get to That"" is honest-to-whoever pop that showed Funkadelic could be serious from time to time, especially when it came to social commentary (and also featured Isaac Hayes' female background singers, giving it a classic soul sheen), and ""Wars of Armageddon"" (recently, wisely used by Optimo on the Psyche Out mix) is a knock-out-drag-down fight to the death between the world's best rhythm section and paranoid, psychedelic sound effects and crowd sounds. Maggot Brain was an explosive record, bursting at the seams with exactly the kind of larger than life sound a band called Funkadelic should have made. Too bad most of the band left afterwards. Tiki Fulwood was fired due to drugs getting in the way of his reliability as a band member; Tawl Ross reportedly got into an ""acid eating contest, then snorting some raw speed, before completely flipping out,"" per Billy Nelson, and has not performed professionally since; Nelson himself quit over a money dispute with Clinton, leaving only Hazel and Worrell from the original Funkadelic lineup. Drummer Tyrone Lampkin replaced Fulwood, while guitarist Gary Shider (who'd already played with the band on parts of Maggot Brain) came aboard to fill out the sound. However, a lot of folks would look at former JBs like Phelps and William ""Bootsy"" Collins additions as the most significant. Certainly, Bootsy's mark on the whole Parliafunkadelicmint thang would eventually be almost as strong as Clinton's. Nevertheless, 1972's America Eats Its Young is a disparate, schizophrenic record. Despite Clinton's efforts to produce a record that would have a better chance at crossover appeal than the first three Funkadelic records, like many double LPs, there's simply too much material, and too many conflicting directions to really make this seem anything other than a Frankenstein production. Of course, it has its classics: ""Loose Booty"" and ""A Joyful Process"" are the two of the best pure funk songs the band ever did, while ""If You Don't Like the Effects, Don't Produce the Cause"", ""Biological Speculation"", ""Everybody Is Going to Make It This Time"", and ""Miss Lucifer's Love"" are great evidence of the band's strong pop bent even as their chosen subject matters could range from dark to disturbing to sci-fi. Tunes like ""I Call My Baby Pussycat"", ""Balance"", and ""Philmore"" even hark back to the more rock-oriented stuff of the first three records. However, it's hard to hear ""We Hurt Too"" (a maudlin ballad about the hidden tenderness of men) as anything but a joke, and the title track, similar to Maggot Brain's title cut, is a bit heavy on the huffing and panting. I think of this record as Funkadelic's White Album, containing too much great stuff to dismiss, but by almost anyone's standards, containing more than it needs. From here on out, Funkadelic would devote increasingly more time to maintaining and expanding their appeal. Albums like Let's Take It to the Stage and Standing on the Verge of Getting It on (also reissued, along with Tales of Kidd Funkadelic) were considerably less freaked-out than the early stuff, but alongside Parliament's concurrent music, helped turn Clinton's empire into one of the biggest acts in music. Still, I'll always love their first records the most. Call me rockist if you will, there's just something undeniably awesome about a funk band blasting guitar jams and telling me about neurotic bitches who want to take over the universe.","Four reissues of Funkadelic's essential, early-1970s Westbound Records releases.

Spelled in Bones,Fruit Bats,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4e5e6ef9596932321a/1:1/w_160/aa162c34.jpg,2005-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3230-spelled-in-bones/,Sub Pop,"Allow me to burst your bubble: Fruit Bats have found a new drummer, 11 days after Pitchfork deemed their ISO newsworthy. His name is Ron Lewis, and by day he's a cheesemonger. (Folks, you can't make this stuff up.) But buck up, would-be Bonhams: There are more exciting outfits to get down with, bands that change tempo, use odd meter, leave space for rip-roarin' tom rolls. Fruit Bats, not so much; they traffic in power-pop without the crunch and speed-- or, in brainchild Eric Johnson's ambitious mind, the hypothetical link-up of Holy Modal Rounders and Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac. Ron Lewis, I hereby charge you, sir, with making these fine songwriters less fucking facile. I want you to bring a brick of oozy stilton to rehearsal and let that sucker stink up these folk-poppers' cleanly confections. If you want a tutorial in how to render well-written songs flaccid and boring, pick up Spelled in Bones. Critics bray about ""trimming the fat"" but that's specious; fat is good! Fat is French! Fruit Bats could use some flab; even the title track, a groggy wisp of a ballad that should drag on ad infinitum, wraps up in under four minutes. Where are the tumescent guitar peals, the reverb-drowned vocals, the bombastic drums? There is no two-part coda. Worse, no trumpet fanfare. Mr. Lewis, you have a tough road to hoe. But you're ideal for the job. Johnson retains his affinity for spic-and-span 70s pop-- the kind that put newspaper in the bass drum, sat Elton John at the keys, and was tooled on a microbiotic level. But what John and the Macs (both Fleetwood and P. __Cartney) lacked in daring, they more than made up for in cheese. So it's to the Fruit Bats' credit that they chose a replacement skins-hitter who actually peddles the stuff. Spelled in Bones doesn't achieve Rounders-Rumours synthesis, but it does successfully update arena fro-yo by excising the coke-fed navel-gazing. Where their forebears slung self-absorbed musings from a druggy maw, Johnson's words harmonize with the Bats' docility. Fruit Bats previously got pleasant with a pair of sleepy Brian Deck-produced slabs, 2001's Echolocation and 2003's Sub Pop debut Mouthfuls. But Spelled in Bones, their most polished effort, teeters near soporific. And that's a shame, because it houses some of the band's best songs. Though the consistency of instrumentation, volume, and tempo invite the ear to wander, there are jags of awesomeness. Amid so much swooshing fluidity, the closing vocal repetition on ""Silent Life"" is almost defiant. Listless ballad ""TV Waves"" is jolted by a chugging, hi-hat driven pickup, which, beneath melty guitar peals (finally), gives the illusion of double-time. Johnson's vox are polite and low-key mostly, which is why his sudden unblanketing of a sultry falsetto on ""Born in the '70s"" is both a much-needed spark and a tease. Instead of paying homage to the megastars of a bygone era-- whose sound comes naturally but whose spirit remains evasive-- Fruit Bats should focus on where they fit in among active analogues. For Pete's sake, they're on Sup Pop. With a loosened-up approach Johnson could put himself in a league with A.C. Newman and labelmates the Shins. As for newcomer Lewis: Bring it, kid. Better that the new pup shit all over the rug than hide behind the couch all day.","Fruit Bats' second Sub Pop LP and third overall is their first without Brian Deck as producer; the result is more spic-and-span 70s pop.

Party Animals,Turbonegro,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82fc0084474cd0c0d89/1:1/w_160/0bfcb434.jpg,2005-08-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8187-party-animals/,Burning Heart,"From a fan's perspective, Norway's Turbonegro have epitomized everything that can go wrong with a rock band. After releasing two amazingly deprived, hedonistic, sometimes downright unsettling punk-rock albums in the late 90's (1997's Ass Cobra and 1999's Apocalypse Dudes), the band broke up amidst self-perpetuated rumors of rock'n'roll excess, drug abuse, and mental breakdowns. In the years that followed, however, the band's popularity grew, especially stateside, where they were practically unknown during their original tenure. In 2002, they returned with Scandinavian Leather, an album that placed more emphasis on mid-tempo rock than any of their work so far, and although it was a definite step down from previous work, it still delivered plenty of the band's characteristic sub-toilet humor while showcasing their impressive musicianship. But really, it didn't come as much of a surprise that Scandinavian Leather didn't deliver the same quality as the pre-breakup albums. How often does a band return from a split and maintain their momentum? And unfortunately, Turbonegro have continued their downward descent with their sixth studio album, Party Animals, a steaming pile of generic cock-rock with hardly a trace of the ""death punk"" the band began bashing out over a decade ago. For a band that has used surprise and shock value to their credit so often in the past, to hear Turbonegro slink their way into such a predictable pattern is a disappointment to say the least. Just like the two albums before it, Party Animals begins with a brief intro before launching into the first true song. But unlike the other two intros, this one is just a mess, combining obnoxious guitar soloing, an unintelligible robotic voice over, and a ""We Will Rock You"" style drum beat. It's more irritating than anything, and it does nothing to ramp up the listener for the rest of the album. The first real song, ""All My Friends Are Dead"", is one of the better tracks, but even so it wouldn't quite hold up in the context of the band's stronger work. It's on par with some of the more upbeat work from Scandinavian Leather as your basic three-chord punk, but it's also the first sign of how crisp and clean of the album sounds, thanks in part to Redd Kross bassist/producer Steve McDonald. And from there on, it's a miss-or-horribly-miss affair until the end. ""Blow Me Like the Wind"" is way too catchy for its own good, and singer Hank Von Helvete's lyrics are so insipid you'll crave the depth of such past hits as ""Wipe It 'Til It Bleeds."" A sample: ""If I gave you a dime, would you blow my paradigm? If I gave you my candle, would it be too hot to handle? If I ran for election, would you support my erection?"" Don't get me wrong; I expect sexual puns from Turbonegro, but I also expect something at least mildly clever and humorous. But Party Animals is neither of those. About the most clever thing here is the track ""If You See Kaye"" (saying it out loud might help to spell out the joke for you, a pun already used by the Poster Children). Elsewhere the band apes everyone from the Dead Boys (""Wasted Again"") to Van Halen (""Stay Free""), and continues with the intentionally just-barely-offensive lyrics. The album's worst offender is ""City of Satan"", which brings back the generic beat you'd hoped to forget from the intro, and features an unlistenable sing-along refrain. But then, about four minutes in, something odd happens. The rhythm changes, the vocals almost completely drop away, and horns and strings join in to punch up the melody. It's like they wanted Bob Ezrin to produce, but could only afford him for those two minutes. This then is the most frustrating aspect of Party Animals: These guys are incredibly talented musicians and arrangers. If they pulled out the strong parts of each song and scrapped the garbage, we'd have an EP that would easily stand alongside anything the band has done in the past. Of course, that's not how it turned out. Party Animals is a failure. It's the sound of a band trying to keep their growing fan base on the upswing, while completely running out of new ideas; the sound of a band collapsing under the weight of their own gimmick.","The second release since the Norwegian band reunited, this is also the group's tamest.

Mangled Demos From 1983,Melvins,by: Austin Gaines,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42ac0084474cd0c3621/1:1/w_160/0a240624.jpg,2005-08-02 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5222-mangled-demos-from-1983/,Ipecac,"You have to wonder why the hell Mike Patton seems to be constructing an empire out of the Melvins. Out of his Ipecac label's 69 spine numbers, at least 25 are Melvins releases or feature a member of the band. If we create sanctuaries for bald eagles, why can't we make one for the goofball kings of sludge? Through Ipecac, the Melvins have been safe to release a book, a noise album, a handful of seven-inches, a re-release of their first album, and even a trilogy. So what kind of gimmick release could top all this? Try a collection of demos from the band's original lineup. When listening to Mangled Demos From 1983, it's apparent that hardcore ruled U.S. indie rock in the 80s. Your parents probably met at a Bad Brains show, and you were probably conceived to a Minor Threat tape later that night (thus making you the straight-edge antichrist). It's no wonder, then, that before they played sludge or Dale Crover joined on drums, these drunk-ass punks from an isolated town in Washington state started a hardcore band. ""Forgotten Principles"", ""If You Get Bored"", and ""Set Me Straight"" have all the generic traits of TSOL, DRI, MDC (and any other acronym you can think of), with their surly, semi-guttural vocals, high-pitched buzzing guitars, and drums that suddenly switch to double-time in an attempt to mask that the same riff is played over and over. Elsewhere, ""Matt Alec"" predicts the meandering grunge that the Melvins were known for, and which millions of kids in overpriced Doc Martens would discover after getting into Nirvana. (""It just ain't a Melvins review without a Cobain reference,"" my hardcore mom used to say.) The highlight of this amateur collection is the Elks Lodge Christmas radio broadcast of ""If You Get Bored"". It starts with banter between God-fearing, blue-collar, WASP announcers and a laughably ""punk as fuck"" Matt Lukin (who would leave after these recordings to eventually form Mudhoney). After the announcers treat the band like cute little kids at a church talent show, Buzz Osbourne and crew proceed to horrify the small town audience with a barrage of blistering noise. Thank God Buzz and company learned to love Sabbath and gave up on being the next hardcore band to move to L.A. and get prominently featured on cheaply photocopied fliers. The Melvins have made some great albums over time (Lysol, Bullhead, and Stoner Witch among them) yet Mangled Demos probably should have lingered in obscurity, cannibalized on various bootlegs for the inquisitive fan to stumble upon on the internet. Instead, thanks to Ipecac, the world has yet another Melvins record floating around.","Ipecac presents the work of the pre-Dale Crover, hardcore-lovin', teenage Melvins.

"12""/80s/2",Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08413d19756521383dd/1:1/w_160/fd32d322.jpg,2005-08-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11712-1280s2/,Family,"We cracked this open at work the other day to give a fellow co-worker (born after 1984) a taste of the original version of 2005's best single (Crazy Frog's ""Axel F""). The verdict: too slow and would be improved by cartoon amphibian ragga chat. So it goes with the rest of 12""/80s/2. Critic and personal hero John Leland has said the 12"" single was the artform (not just the format) of the 1980s, and he's not wrong. On other days I might just make it ""single,"" since 12"" leaves out such totemic 80s artifacts as the first Minor Threat record and Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"". But singles are almost always the artform of any decade, and limiting it to 12""'s for a certain decade makes it nicely polemical. It was probably just a coincidence of commerce, but when CBS (then the biggest major) axed the vinyl single at the dawn of the 90s, it was the end of an era. 12"" singles survive, obviously, but niche marketed to their individual dance scenes. Mixtape tracks, mp3s, whatever...all have features intrinsic to the format that quietly nudge the music into its given shape. When the 12"" single disappeared, so did extended disco motion and mod FX abuse from the pop single still recognizable as a pop single. As the 90s dawned, with house first flexing its iron grip, it became much easier to bung an acapella on top of 4/4 boom-tick to make sure it got Club Play. This is probably the last time ""dance music"" meant multiplicity without being consciously eclectic. Unfortunately, we run into the same problem as the last time I was reviewing one of these things. Scribble out the title above and replace it with ""If You Were White and British In the 80s, It Might Have Sounded Like This."" I count the number of non-palefaces at around three. And, of course, since this is a British collection, no Americans, no rappers, ragga toasters, go-go troupes, Latin freestylers, funk mobs, or unwashed psychobillies. I am not saying it's gotta have the 12"" mixes of ""I Feel For You"" or ""Raspberry Beret"" or the ""Rock Box"" single to be ""complete."" But, from the tracklisting to the octagonal syndrums on the cover, there's an icky kitsch vibe that hampers my enjoyment. Which is a shame because, musically, at least on the first disc, it's pretty unimpeachable, way better than the first. Can you fuck with the Bowie-with-his-nuts-in-a-vice dramedy of the Associates' ""Party Fears Two""? The Tarzan boy roiling dementia of Pigbag's ""Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag""? The ""Annihilation mix"" of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's ""Two Tribes"", which makes cold war paranoia and mutually assured destruction seem both terrifying and thrilling, as well as including the wackest Reagan impersonation this side of Rich Little? The proto-freestyle of the ""Miami mix"" of ABC's ""When Smokey Sings""? The Patrick Nagel glitch of Duran Duran's ""The Reflex""? The best-African-disco-rip-off-ever of Tom Tom Club's ""Genius of Love""? The Cole Porter-meets-conga line acid wit of Kid Creole's ""Annie I'm Not Your Daddy""? (Who, along with Sly & Robbie, are among the few non-anglos here. Oh, and 1/3 of the Thompson Twins.) The amyl nitrate and camp moustache Kraftwerk pastiche of Yello's ""The Race""? No, of course you cannot. As Tom Ewing noted on NYLPM, compilations like this one cast a weird sort of spell in a record store. You hold it in your hands, admire the packaging, notice all the great songs you love and the ones you don't know that could be great, breath in the total consumer object pheromone. And then suddenly all the bad (or mediocre) songs disappear. Until you get it home and play the damn thing. (Generally I have no problem with Culture Club, but ""I'll Tumble 4 Ya"" is so sickly coy and mimsy that you start to think Albini has a point.) These type of comps are also becoming more untenable as (remember kids) legal downloading outpaces traditional bricks and mortar outlets. That sure is nice packaging though.","Sequel to Family's collection of 80s 12""s, this 3xCD collection includes extended mixes of such classics as ""Party Fears Two"" and ""Genius of Love"".

The Tone of the Universe (= The Tone of the Earth),Various Artists,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84fc0084474cd0c0dd7/1:1/w_160/56a858d2.gif,2005-08-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2094-the-tone-of-the-universe-the-tone-of-the-earth/,PsuedoArcana,"Drone is liturgy. Since its mid-century installation in the repertoire of experimental music, drone has been coded with naked aspirations: people looking to the holy East; people looking to the archaic; people looking into deep space, into the pure machine, into the stranger mind. Drone has always been enamored of the faraway. The sacred, as always, must be imported from there. Its devotees are few but fervent. But the faith has always seemed strangely incommunicable: It doesn't seem to get many converts, just initiates and infidels and no commerce between them. Missionary work is a slog. Those who have made stabs at evangelization know the response is usually incredulity rather than hostility. Minimalist classics have been returned to me with a blankness bordering on incomprehension, as if I'd handed out videotapes of television snow and demanded an assessment of character arcs. So it is rare to find yourself born again to a random airing of You Are My Everlovin'/Celestial Power. If you own it, chances are you've already been saved by it. But the seekers of the world owe a just debt of gratitude to Antony Milton's PseudoArcana label for offering up a fine little hymnal for our headphone communions. True to form, the call to prayer comes by way of the Perseus Cluster, a gathering of galaxies some 250 million light years away, which astronomers believe has been humming a steady B-flat drone since the universe was a toddler. Marshalling the extensive and shadowy networks developed between NASA and the New Zealand free noise scene in the wane of the Carter administration, a tribute album to the bass cluster has emerged. And though of dubious scientific merit and obscure political import, The Tone of the Universe (=The Tone of the Earth) is a monumental collection of music. Appropriate to a work of intergalactic negotiation, the compilation draws from the farthest flung reaches of terrestrial drone: New Zealand, the UK, Italy, Argentina, Finland, and the U.S. have sent delegates, like some kind of very slow and poorly-lit Olympiad. This geographical variety translates brilliantly into sound, every contributor seemingly speaking in his or her own musical language, and none falling back on the ponderous immobility that can render minimalism so oppressive. On ""Map of Dusk"", the Blithe Sons, charter members of San Francisco's illustrious Jewelled Antler collective, dispense with their California pastorals and backyard musique concrete for something less humane: a pestilential little cloud of harmonium evaporations and feedback expanding and compressing like an iron lung. Peter Wright's idyllic ""Haboob""-- one of the collection's high points-- is barely drone in any sense of the word, a lyrical 12-string guitar prayer plucked over delicately tremulous strings. The heavy trappings of bow-and-scrape drone are eschewed in Finnish experimentalist Keijo's ""Stellar Wind"", a weirdly rollicking folk blues ramble. Even shot through with warbling treated winds and chirpy electronica, the track seems more suited to the high plains than the higher nebulae. And for those somehow not satiated by last year's sprawling 3xCD set, Pontiac Lady, the mighty Vibracathedral Orchestra add a short jagged slab of noise-rock much more uproarious than their usual skittering ceremony. ""3 Bb Moods"" lurches into Acid Mothers territory with shrapnel guitar lines exploding over psilocybin raga. Vibracathedral's explosive excursion into electric heavyland resolves into Hands of Satisfaction's long ""Version 1"", 11 minutes of noise pointillism, where dead guitar bursts punctuate soft clatter and glitch. Expansive and not entirely successful, ""Version 1"" flags early and doesn't vary its formula. The second disc of the collection is dominated by contributions from the Celebrate Psi Phenomenon crowd. C/Psi/P label head Campbell Kneale's own Birchville Cat Motel serves up a behemoth of bright and majestic skree ""I Am But Dust"". Few practitioners of the art have the natural virtuosity of Kneale, who, like surgeons and serial killers, succeeds by sheer dint of patience. Kneale trusts his own ideas and is unafraid to let them unfold over great durations; and the eight-minutes of washed-out organs and screaming guitars in ""I am But Dust"" proceed with the pomp and circumstance of a coronation procession. Seht's unnerving and appropriately titled ""Antarctica Download (Edit)"" turns warm analog cold, with bright keyboards dripped as icicles ominously from all directions. The piercing scrapes and gongs of 1/3 Octave Band's ""Dominion"", on the other hand, are harsh and unpleasant, albeit mercifully brief. The Tone of the Universe concludes with the grand galactica of the brothers Opalio, the Italian sonic cosmonauts better known as My Cat is an Alien. Amidst bells and phasers and dubious space opera sound effects, an accented continental repeatedly urges us to ""hear the voice of the cosmos."" But to his credit he does not say precisely where one must listen for it. Even with the odd failed experiment or heavy-handed concoction, The Tone of the Universe on the whole succeeds brilliantly, not by paying homage to heavenly bodies resonating 57 octaves below the limits of human hearing, but by bringing the cold and scattered outskirts of the musical galaxy a little closer to hand. There is great solace in hearing that there are still strange goings-on abroad on this planet.

Power to the People and the Beats,Public Enemy,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14dea9e61561daa477b/1:1/w_160/6b084c00.jpg,2005-08-02 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6502-power-to-the-people-and-the-beats/,Def Jam,"There's something almost inherently wrong with learning hip-hop history rather than living through it. Like most youthful rap devotees, I'm a hyper-cognizant, Mix Hut-hoarding zombie, searching out the newest chipmunk loop or broken drum break, learning as I go, collecting knowledge, filing production credits on the regular. But perspective is missing from most young-folk rap criticism today. When forced to research, say, UTFO, Audio Two, or other bygone pillars, it can be difficult to stay focused. The productions can be creaky or the vocals poorly mixed. There are titans (Marley Marl and Paul C. come to mind), but mostly everyone is feeling the sounds out, and adapting to new technology, budgets, etc. We're in the midst of a pop progressives era, thanks to the likes of Just Blaze, Dr. Dre, Pharrell, and Timbaland-- mainstream men literally pushing harder than the next to find the most curious, throttling sounds to ground a pop record. Right now, someone like Grandmaster Flash, while noble and significant, sounds staid. Public Enemy remain one of the few acts that can stand up to the sonic innovations of those dudes-- and in most cases still eclipse them. When I first started devouring the P.E. canon, it was emotional to discover something from their day that sounded like 2077 A.D. The shit still can't be touched. Still, there's really no sense in compiling a Public Enemy greatest hits. They are a classic ""albums"" band, full of songs that crash into each other with force, amelodic glory spilling into James Brown's chopped-up yelps and shouts. It was done once before with 2001's pitiful Universal Masters Collection, a poorly constructed quickie cash-in. If you're serious about 20th century music, P.E.'s first four albums are essential. Yo! Bumrush the Show, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Fear of a Black Planet, and (to a lesser extent) Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black are all sweltering documents of a furiously exciting period. Culling the bulk of its content from those albums, Power to the People and the Beats doesn't offer much unity; rather, it skips chronologically from one chest-thumper to the next. In particular, Nation of Millions and Black Planet, the band's most revered works, get mined for 10 of the collection's 18 tracks. Things jump off with their all-business 1982 fight song ""Public Enemy No. 1"", a track that spurred then-short-bearded buddy Rick Rubin to encourage Chuck D and the newly formed P.E. to pursue a career and sign to Def Jam. Chuck, then 22 and working at Adelphi University's WBAU, initially thought he was too old for the rap game and resisted Rubin's nudging-- luckily, Rubin eventually broke him down. Cobbled-together compilations that utilize the chronological movement usually make sense as a means of understanding an artist's progression, but as a unit, P.E. were so scintillating and fully realized on ""Public Enemy No.1""-- all buzzing squirt synths and defiant Carlton Ridenhour braggadocio-- that to end on 1998's mildly received soundtrack cut ""He Got Game"" is deflating and marks a less-than-subtle regression. But fear not, from ""Rebel Without a Pause"" to ""Fight the Power"" (still the angriest pop song of all time) to the underrated MLK Day screed ""By the Time I Get to Arizona"", Power to the People and the Beats doesn't miss a hit. The gang's all here, too: Flavor Flav, rap's first necessary hypeman; the Bomb Squad, whose avant-garde sample-and-smash productions are still ahead of their time; DJ par excellence Terminator X; and Professor Griff's misguided proselytizing. The construction of the group-- not just musically, but in presentation-- was so dynamic and original that it's impossible replicate in print. Just watch the ""Fight the Power"" video. It's still easy to visualize foot soldiers, the S1Ws, marching along to ""Welcome to the Terrordome""'s walloping snare. Of all the commercially viable and artfully innovative groups of the 1980s, not one is fucking with Public Enemy. Chuck brought a political conscience that spoke mostly out of anger and disenfranchisement (""I like Nike, but wait a minute.../ The neighborhoods are poor, so put some money in it""), and his baritone could flow for days. Flav, a media clown nowadays, is well-represented with ""911 Is a Joke"" and ""Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man"". During this period, Flav was funny but never obsequious, so his spiral into VH1dom is saddening. Terminator X remains a singularly important DJ, unafraid to frighten an audience with thrash and bombast, but also fully aware of how tunefulness lay at the heart of any crowd-mover. The Shocklee Brothers (along with a young Easy Mo Bee, Gary G-Wiz, Eric Sadler, Sleek, and Panic) delivered a new style of music production, chopping loops and samples so harshly and precisely that each track bangs like an elephant stampede. Only the late-era ""Give It Up"" has any sort of sing-along tunefulness here. There are a few minor omissions and fumbles. We're without the ill-advised Anthrax misstep ""Bring the Noize"", rap-rock before we all hated rap-rock. Early jams like ""My Uzi Weighs a Ton"" and ""Louder Than a Bomb"" are omitted to make room for the more obscure ""Hazy Shade of Criminal"". That track is the lone Greatest Misses representative here, but though intriguing for its martial anarchy, it's hardly vital to their oeuvre. Otherwise, Power to the People's tracklist is essentially bulletproof, with latter-day releases like 2003's Revolverlution wisely excluded. In fact, my only personal gripe is the absence of Pete Rock's remix for ""Shut 'em Down"", arguably the finest argument for hip-hop remixes ever. There's been something of a Public Enemy revival of late. In addition to this collection, a live DVD, It Takes a Nation: The First London Invasion Tour 1987, was released in May. Another as-yet-untitled LP is due this fall. (Rebirth of a Nation has been delayed until sometime next year.) Chuck D likewise remains a vocal presence in politics and technology (he was one of the original advocates of filesharing), if no longer a rapper's delight. It's nice that there's a minor resurgence, as it's likely to turn a new generation onto such pioneers, but it makes me yearn for the real thing. Which, of course, I didn't even grow up with.","This well-chosen, single-disc PE best-of highlights the band's power, vitality, and invention but is no substitute for their early studio albums.

Electrified,Dressy Bessy,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1bea9e61561daa7145/1:1/w_160/cf797aa5.jpg,2005-08-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2455-electrified/,Transdreamer,"In rock's answer to rap battling, Denver four-piece Dressy Bessy KO'ed mainstream goliath Coldplay on a June NPR broadcast pitting the bands against each other. In Bessy's corner, NPR's Ken Tucker gave mad props to the band's more, er, ""electrifying"" sound, while roasting Coldplay's soporific set. Not to sound all Darwinist here, but without competition there's little incentive for improvement, which would explain Electrified's concession to safe, suburbia-friendly new wave. Sure, on 2003's self-titled effort the band spit out their bubblegum sound and assumed a more grown-up persona, but frontwoman Tammy Ealom's miffed sexuality felt like playacting. That album's dolled up production gets dressed to the nines on Electrified, taking its mixing cues from Last Splash while settling for Veruca Salt-caliber songwriting. Mid-tempo rocker ""Stop Foolin'"" best summarizes this problematic dichotomy. Innocuous power chords drag along a sedated, Pixies-inflected riff, with both dependent on Ealom's prominent and often nuanced vocals to substantiate the song's pedestrian structure. Ealom almost reconciles these influences on the standout title track, with her coy gasps (""you're six feet tall, electrified!"") and riot grrrl 'tude (""Suspicion, don't push me down/ Your diction is off the wall"") establishing a brusque female libido that would've been squelched on earlier albums. No way Ealom's sultry overemphasis on the first syllable of ""dic-tion"" passes on the fluffy Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons. Unfortunately when Ealom sticks her neck out, no one's got her back. Electrified's rife with cardboard power chord progressions that should've been buried with all the other Nirvana aftermath opportunists. There's literally a stretch of six or seven songs here where I keep thinking I accidentally had the repeat button on. Fortunately the dry spots here aren't egregious, save for some cutesy Saddle Creek moments speckled throughout. Maybe Entertainment Weekly's right proclaiming the band ""the best thing to come out of Denver since John Elway!"", but if you hold indie supremacy over Colorado's music scene and the Denver Broncos, chances are your band's nothing but paper champs.","Colorado indie band punches up its sounds on its latest LP.

Rough Trade Shops: Counter Culture 04,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84e5e6ef959693211a0/1:1/w_160/b86d4008.gif,2005-08-01 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2093-rough-trade-shops-counter-culture-04/,Mute,"Hey remember 2004? Unless you care about nuclear proliferation, the Geneva Conventions or wholesale death/destruction in countries that aren't the U.S. of freakin' A., that was a pretty good year. The Red Sox shattered the Curse. Animal Collective (disc 1, track 20) deconstructed SMiLE!-style harmonies and resurrected them in a misty, pantheistic glen. The Go! Team (disc 2, track 4) rocketed over cynics like so many triumphant TV-theme samples and block-party beats. Speaking of, Bloc Party (disc 2, track 22) here offer some of their undeniably accessible post-what-have-you. At London's Rough Trade Shops, 2004 was apparently a year of sleep-encrusted avant-folk (disc 1) and steroidal dance-punk (disc 2, with happy exceptions). Omissions are legion, well-documented, and fun to point out: Mike Skinner's thousand quid? Lost again! Arcade Fire's Funeral? They've never been born! The Concretes? Their name's actually on the album cover, but I guess they don't watch Target ads overseas. Over two discs and 49 songs, the Rough Trade crew requite themselves better as historical curators than as present-day tastemakers. Their greatest discoveries are actually rediscoveries, like 1966's ""Please Stay"", an achingly desperate, far-superior Drifters cover by overlooked Merseybeat sextet the Cryin' Shames (not to be confused with Nuggets vets the Cryan' Shames). Candi Staton turns in tear-stained turn-of-the-70s Southern soul classic ""You Don't Love Me No More"", reissued last year as part of a welcome Astralwerks anthology. The Cramps' backing on Queen of Rockabilly Wanda Jackson's recent re-recording of her 1962 ""Funnel of Love"" whisks the song into the psychedelic tumbleweed of First Edition-era Kenny Rogers. As for new stuff: The quiet disc (disc 1, in case you weren't paying attention) starts with an ethereal sigh, ""Believer"", courtesy of Norwegian group Susanna and the Magic Orchestra, which includes Jaga Jazzist alums, and somnambulates from there, only occasionally bumping into wakeful brilliance. For every ""Let's Get Lost"", a typically depressive Elliott Smith song in ""Mother Nature's Son"" bake, there's a mood-killer by CocoRosie or Pony Up!, with passable but forgettable folk from the likes of Willy Mason between. Holly Golightly gets off the comp's best one-liner (""The diamonds you gave me still sparkle like diamonds""), Britta Phillips & Dean Wareham offer a rare dud awash in hokey new-age sound-effects (it's raining Z's!), Coil's hilariously forced rhymes make ""Sex With Sun Ra"" sound worse than celibacy. The loud disc (part dieux) hails from a parallel 2004 where indie kids, upon learning how to dance, refused to dance to anything smacking of pop. Annie, M.I.A., we hardly knew ye. Gang of Four comparisons have grown tiresome because dudes keep boring us in their name: Do Me Bad Things (guitar-shredding dance-punk!), Schwab (impending lawsuit-mandated name-change dance-punk!), Measles Mumps Rubella (vaccinate-your-children-or-you'll-be-forced-to-listen-to-this dance-punk!). Liars' noisy change in direction has never been so appreciated, nor has Death From Above 1979's visceral magnetism. When dancing to guitars grows tiresome, we groove electro: Mu, the Knife, the unfortunate new Le Tigre. Alter Ego's ""Rocker"" is a bona fide dancefloor filler, and that Throbbing Gristle remix is pretty OK, but given a 2004 like this it's no wonder the Rough Trade guys find their most pleasant memories in music's past.","Remember 2004?

Chin Up Chin Up EP,Chin Up Chin Up,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a729ea9e61561daa5513/1:1/w_160/69946f5a.gif,2005-08-01 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1793-chin-up-chin-up-ep/,"Record Label, 2000Record Label, 2000","This isn't the follow-up to Chin Up Chin Up's promising debut, but a reprint of their first EP with the addition of two remixes, an acoustic version of ""Falcons and Vulcans"", and a video. Hearing it now, it obviously sounds like a first step, but it reaffirms what many heard on We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers: a poppy spin on a familiar sound, a singer still finding his voice, and a band with a great deal of potential. The original version of ""Collide the Tide"" opens the EP (it was re-recorded for their full-length), and while the hand-muted guitar scratches and funk rhythms wedged between jangly choruses weren't exactly revelatory on either version, the chords pull a surprisingly tender switch beneath Jeremy Bolan's hushed vocals, and this version's rhythm flows a little more naturally, like post-rock with a steady pop pulse underneath instead of just playing bait-and-switch with genre. The EP doesn't have half of the varied instrumentation of their following full-length, so tracks like ""Fuck You, Elton John"" and ""For All the Tanning Salons in Texas"" fall a bit flat. ""Elton John"" could have been more successful if its climax didn't depend on Bolan's ability to belt out his vocals, and he strains when outside of the hoarse, near-whispered style he relies on. The band are still toying with ideas here, and ""Tanning Salons"" gets by on galloping guitar lines that would suffice for an instrumental, but sound gray and flat in the context of a pop song. However, there is some variation here. ""The Soccer Mom Gets Her Fix"" winds 80s keyboards around its unpredictable rhythms. ""I'm Not Asking for a Tennis Bracelet"" uses a theremin as its anchoring melody (played by fellow Chicagoan Devin Davis), and grows progressively calmer over the many permutations of winding guitar notes and layered vocals. ""Pillage the Village"" is an average performance that nonetheless builds nicely, and the minimal one-note keyboards hint at the Cure influence that was expanded upon on We Should Have Never Lived... The remix of ""We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers"" is reverent to the original, borrowing all the right segments and stretching the wistful emotions at the heart of the track. Unfortunately, the new beat is average and tepid IDM fare-- so close, and yet so far. The remix of ""The Architect has a Gun"" by Ronald Simmons/Gene McDonald (aka Tim Kinsella) leans too far in the other direction, taking the originals's elated vocal performance and twisting it into low, creepy choirs and buzzing hives, but it's neither a very daring nor memorable sound. ""Falconz and Vulcanz"", however, translates surprisingly well in an acoustic setting, revealing richly melodic guitar work. Despite their ponderous song titles and instrumentation, Chin Up Chin Up were already reaching towards concise pop songs on their debut EP. The best songs here straddle the line between melodic indie and post-rock, and if the band could use the merits of both, balance technical ability and instrumental tension-and-release with sharp hooks, they'd have boundless potential for great future records. Listening to the varied arrangements and melodies of We Should Have Never Lived... after hearing this EP makes it sound all the more possible. I can't wait to hear what they do next.","Promising Chicago indie rockers reissue their self-titled EP, adding two remixes, an acoustic version of ""Falcons and Vulcans"", and a video.

Lover's Acid,Luke Vibert,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9549d034d5c69bf3c26/1:1/w_160/357d1682.jpg,2005-08-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8464-lovers-acid/,Planet µ,"Lotta acid in 2005. Apparently the long elliptical orbit of music fashion has brought the squelchy buzz of the 303 back into view. It's just the tip of the iceberg, I'm sure, but in the last couple months I've sifted through all the AFX Analord releases, digested Uwe Schmidt's faux comp Acid Evolution 1988-2003, Soul Jazz's Chicago acid house disc, and this, Luke Vibert's collection of three acid-themed 12-inches put out by Planet Mu. Of the newly recorded material, this is the best of that lot. I've never been a huge Vibert fan in any of his various guises (Plug, Wagon Christ, etc). His music has always seemed workmanlike and consistently listenable, but I was never able to tease out much in the way of personality. Lover's Acid, though, reveals Vibert as a producer with a keen sense of musical humor and an abiding interest in funkiness. ""Funky Acid Stuff"" from the ""'95-'99"" 12-inch is an excellent opener-- a James Brown bassline sample combined with big, splashy drums, which drives an wonderfully obnoxious acid line through the center of the thing. The breaks on ""Acid2000"" also draw rhythmic inspiration from hip-hop, with a simple piano progression serves as a delicious contrast to the busy electronics. On these tracks it's enjoyable to hear Vibert's instrumental hip-hop Ninja Tune aesthetic with the lead 303 way out front. The pure machine tracks are slightly less interesting but still good. ""Lover's Acid"" is a spacey mid-tempo number that's basically just dinky analog drum programming behind a lead squiggle, and the late-90s track ""Analord"" has a vintage palette quite similar to the recent AFX project of the same name. Vibert's take on the sound is simpler and more pop, with regular hints of sing-songy new wave in the melody. ""Come on Chaos"", a rougher electro track out of a sci-fi film chase scene, loses some energy with clichd ""C-c-c-c come on!"" vocal samples. Two tracks, the Mo' Wax-style trip-hop ""Prick Tat"" and the faux-exotica ""Gwithian"", forego the acid theme entirely, and both come across as the same sort of solid but unexceptional material Vibert has been making for a long time. All told Lover's Acid is a lot of fun despite a few dull patches. These dozen tracks recorded over the course of eight or nine years show little reference for any particular genre, and seem to grab from whatever's handy and might provide a laugh. Where the AFX Analord records followed the gurgle of the 303 straight into the guts of the machine to mediate on the physics of vintage electronics, Vibert uses the essential ridiculousness of the sound as a foundation on which to build effective party music.","The acid revival continues, here courtesy of the veteran electronic producer and Planet Mu.

Ta Det Lugnt [Expanded Edition],Dungen,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8c13d197565213b0f5/1:1/w_160/f5816f8d.gif,2005-08-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2575-ta-det-lugnt-expanded/,Kemado,"Despite the constant influx of catchphrase-coordinated marketing campaigns that would lead you to believe that life-affirming records are released daily, it's forever rare to stumble upon one as consistently mind-blowing and aesthetically far-reaching as Dungen's Ta Det Lugnt. Because of this scarcity, when such an unexpected (and immediate) discovery does take place, it's like being struck by indescribable melodic lightning: Unlike discs that warrant facile disses or mediocre passing grades, the countless reasons for its boundless successes remain ineffable and shadowy despite repeat late-night close-listening sessions. Simply put, Dungen exhibit all the signs of legitimate, hard-won staying power. Ta Det Lugnt is an exceedingly triumphant psych-pop oddity that evokes Keith Moon's drum fills on The Who Sell Out, the wraiths of unsung bedroom psyche celebrants, and the acoustic sustain and harmonizing of The Byrds' Younger Than Yesterday. Ta Det Lugnt feels less like a new release than some ancient tome, a fully formed masterpiece dropped unexpectedly on corduroy laps from some blue-brown sky. It's so aesthetically tight that even carbon dating insists that it could not be post-millennial. To be sure, there's a major difference between retro and somehow embodying your parents' vintage zeitgeist: It's damn-near impossible to believe that the humming tubes, crackling drums, smoky backdrop, and complexly interwoven melodies on Ta Det Lugnt were birthed in a quick-fix iPod age. But perhaps even more impressive is that, despite the music's headiness and intricacy, its anachronistic results feel unusually effortless, earnest, and unpretentious: Dungen seem driven to this sound not for bloodless cred points, but out of a very sincere devotion to the music from a bygone era. Accomplished beyond his years, 26-year-old Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gustav Ejstes is the pin-up mastermind behind Dungen's vibrant polish. For the full duration of his third album's 13 bracing tracks, he perfectly inhabits-- and then expands upon-- his homeland's late-60s/early-70s acid-rock scene. Ta Det Lugnt particularly taps into the expansiveness of his Swedish psych predecessors, Parson Sound, while maintaining a murky rocker edge: Imagine that band colliding with The Kinks, or Amon Dl II with Olivia Tremor Control, or Comets on Fire with The Zombies on their way to Terrastock. Interested in pushing pop glitter to its limits, Ejstes doesn't go as far afield into psych-pop cliches like chirping birds and hippie atmospherics as his elder brethren, but his equally vintage garage sound allows a definite space for ethereality in the form of funereal dew-drop strings, free jazz breakdowns, brief whiffs of AM radio tuning, flute minuets, lushly cascading pianos, prog time changes, florid medieval chimes, sky-melting freak outs, church organs, fuzz-guitar jousts, doubled mountain-top whistles, roaring six-string solos, and autumnal instrumental interludes. It's obvious his songs are painstakingly arranged with a sense of depth, gradations, and tonal three-dimensionality redolent of something as off the charts as Pet Sounds. I said all of the above and more last year, and it still holds true. Hindsight and new layers of hype included, Ta Det Lugnt remains a consistently amazing album. Since my initial tongue-wagging Dungen's deservedly gone from limited distribution and whispered word-of-mouth to NME hyperbole and glowing write-ups in just about every community newspaper from the Philadelphia Daily News to San Francisco Weekly (and beyond). There's also been a rush to offer more sounds: A few months back came the generally misunderstood compilation 1999-2001, wherein Ejstes re-stitched early material into three lengthy soundscapes instead of presenting them in their original form, and now, of course, comes the U.S. re-release of the fire starter, Ta Det Lugnt. Repackaged by NYC's Kemado Records (home of Elefant, Diamond Nights, and goofy Brooklyn loft crashers Cheeseburger), the album is as it was, but comes with an extra CD that includes five previously unreleased tracks, which will also eventually appear on Subliminal Sounds as a vinyl 12"". As might be expected, the add-ons aren't as amazingly ordered or cohesive as the album proper, but they do pleasingly expand the Dungen oeuvre. Of the five tracks, four are instrumental. Only the opener, ""Tyst Minut"", an outtake from the Ta Det Lugnt sessions, offers a new taste of Ejstes' Swedish. The sleepy mid-tempo four minutes open with crystalline strums, Nyquil vocalizations and chordal rings, then turn back into a semi-smoking singsong. The chorus picks things up a bit with accompanying guitar noodle and the bridge is a molasses solo that shifts into florid piano cascades. It's followed by ""Jamna Plagor"", an instrumental from 2003, notable for its interesting percussion sound (tinny, echoed hand drums?) and mid-song dissolve into a brief metagalactic interstices. Though enjoyable, it's nothing special. More interesting are the three new recordings, ""Sjutton"", ""Christopher"", and ""Badsang"" (""Bathing Song""), which give a taste of Dungen yet-to-come. There's a free, loose feel honing in at points on improvisational jazz and/or Can's galvanic sweep. ""Sjutton""'s pronounced flute and cocky shaker keep time while the rest of the band swaggers and staggers alongside cymbal crashes. The blistering ""Christopher"" is a two-minute showcase of sweaty, Hendrixian psychedelia, as well as a nod to dark-minded LSD trips everywhere. Closer ""Badsang"" sounds very much like something you and yours would plug into while frolicking with water nymphs in a sunny, dusky forest, though the vibrational Dr. Who halfway point does grow a little lizard-king creepy. As increasingly de rigueur reviews cloud the water, it should be interesting to see if Dungen can one day top Ta Det Lugnt, or if album three proves a magically brilliant and unrepeatable accomplishment. Regardless, they seem to be taking the success in stride, showcasing more than a few positive-growth indicators including their emergence as a solid live band (and not simply an elaborate studio project), the decision to continue recording in Swedish, Ejstes' folk fiddle mastery, and the well-grounded, astute experimentation suggested in their newer work.","Finally released in the U.S., this psych-folk 60s throwback is expanded to two disc with the addition of five previously unreleased tracks.

Then again, did he ever really have any in the first place? Always more intrepid as a brand-man (how 'bout those UNKLE Gor-Tex coats and action figures!) or ambitious A&R; (let's get Thom Yorke and Richard Ashcroft!) than a DJ or musician, Lavelle has floundered since DJ Shadow renounced the UNKLE name after the release of their still-impressive Psyence Fiction album. Without Shadow's pummeling drums, the Mo' Wax entrepreneur seemed listless on official follow-up Never, Never Land, and his recent limited-edition UNKLE Sounds DJ set CDs have been passable at best. With the likes of Diplo and Rupture cutting, scratching, and bumping far flung sounds by the hour, Lavelle and Sounds collab-buddy Richard File come off as antiquated as some of the random movies they sample on this lazy and unspectacular motion-pictured-themed two-disc set. Originally created for a ""future cinema"" exhibit at London's Institute for the Contemporary Arts, Edit Music basically takes Lavelle's omnipresent love for all things ominous and cinematic and works them into two hour-long DJ sets that haphazardly cut and paste dialogue from dumbfuck obvious flicks like Scarface and Kill Bill alongside slightly tweaked seven-year-old UNKLE jams (""Lonely Soul""), and continuity-foiling soundtrack picks like Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" (Almost Famous) and Chris Isaak's ""Bad Bad Thing"" (Eyes Wide Shut). Disc One is introduced by the horn-blaring 20th Century Fox theme and such cutesy flourishes (yes, the THX noise-blast and 2001 theme are here too) render these discs throwaway silly. Once the (quaint) thrill of Name That Movie dies down, there's little left besides sometimes pulsing, sometimes ambient soundtrack music that hardly coalesces into a thematic whole (an implicit goal thanks to the frustrating lack of individual track breaks). The image conscious spinner seemingly spent more time on the album's stark quasi-Vader cover than the actual mix; Lavelle's once-refreshing anything-goes ethos has fallen into aimless self-parody as he's now outdone by creative, open-minded mp3 blog-mixers on a daily basis. Even for the few trenchant UNKLE obsessives left, this liner notes-less import is not only unessential but also kind of sad. Foolishly slaving to a lame at-the-movies blueprint, Lavelle ignores the most exciting British beat-styles of today (ahem, grime) and sticks with his trademark doomsday sludge that now sounds as creaky as a knee-jerk John Williams score. Dude should stick to pawning those tres unique (read: fugly) new UNKLE-Nike Dunks on eBay--$102.50 with an hour left!","Originally created for a ""future cinema"" exhibit at London's Institute for the Contemporary Arts, this is James Lavelle's self-described ""Soundtrack Reconstruction"".

Profile,Githead,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c00ec0084474cd0c3121/1:1/w_160/763681a5.jpeg,2005-07-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3661-profile/,Swim~,"Headgit, last year's debut EP from Githead concisely mapped out an interesting sound built on sharp, no-nonsense rhythm and textural guitar interplay. In my review of that record, I even hoped for a full album from the group, which-- as a joint side project of Wire's Colin Newman, Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner), and Minimal Compact's Malka Spigel-- threatened to be little more than a promising one-off. Well, they've delivered that full-length, and though it's very solid, I'm finding myself rather wishing they'd followed the blueprint of Wire's own Read & Burn series and just issued another EP. The Githead sound hasn't changed on the LP, but the songs have grown longer, and Profile suffers as a result of the more long-winded delivery. The band's compositions work best in quick bursts, as they were presented on the EP, but here they stretch them out and work with a narrower palette on each song, sometimes dimming their memorability. It could just be that on an album where the vocals are predominantly spoken and the guitars stripped back to textural and harmonic roles, the relative lack of melody is simply more noticeable over a long period of time. Whatever the case, the record crawls by in a sort of ambient pop vein with a noticeable dub influence and pads the space between highlights with patches of extreme competence, but not much more. The highlights are worth the trip, though, especially Spigel's ""My LCA (Little Box of Magic)"", a song that slips along on soapy bass and clicky programming. (The Beat Monster this time is accompanied by live drummer Max Franken). Spigel's deadpan speaking tone on the verses gives way to a chorus that features her multi-tracked voice singing a two-part harmony in unison with herself, a technique that has the odd effect of adding a melodic hook to the song without really feeling like a melody. Newman's spoken word is more forceful and urgently rhythmic on ""Cosmology for Beginners"" than on most of the rest of the record, and the song benefits greatly from the increased intensity. Unfortunately, the stand-out moments are tempered by the generally static grooves a the kind of compositional streamlining that cuts out a lot of the good stuff along with the gristle. Instrumentals ""Pylons"" and ""Antiphon"" feel like they're building to something bigger but never reach it, and you have to wait through too much basic time-keeping to get to the meat of ""Raining Down"". Whether or not this is it for Githead, it's a shame that Profile doesn't generate the same excitement as their debut, but there's enough quality material lurking in there that it's hardly a total waste. Still, Headgit is quite a bit better, and should be all most people need from this project.","Full-length debut from a collective that boasts Colin Newman, Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner), and Minimal Compact's Malka Spigel.

For the Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,Baïkonour,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49213d1975652138d37/1:1/w_160/e81acacc.gif,2005-07-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1171-for-the-lonely-hearts-of-the-cosmos/,Melodic,"With origins in the same Versailles terroir that birthed Air, it's difficult to resist scrutinizing Jean-Emmanuel Krieger's electronic project Baïkonour for similarities to his fellow countrymen's distinctively purified synthetic landscapes. And though there are moments on Baïkonour's full-length debut, For the Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, that bear comparison to some of the more spacious, iridescent environments of Talkie Walkie, over the album's course Krieger ably distinguishes his work through rigorous, jazz-inflected musicianship and an inspired navigation of spiraling, locomotive Krautrock dynamics. For the Lonely Hearts also distances itself through its unabashed embrace of reliable (if not precisely traditional) rock-based structures. Most of the tracks here feature live drumming provided by Imitation Electric Piano's Lee Adams, and it's often his muscular, hangar-spaced pummel that allows Baïkonour to avoid the stagnant eddies of soporific post-rock. Following the delicate harp-string shimmer of the opening ""Lick Lokoum"", Krieger and Adams immediately kick into the unstoppable motorik-cum-Stax propulsion of ""Coltan Anyone?"" Combining surprisingly humid, greasy rhythms with Krieger's baroque, Floydian keyboard flourishes, this track should provide immediate succor to any waylaid Caribou fans, as it instantly snuffs out any lingering potential for dustless, sci-fi sterility. This last detail feels particularly pertinent, as Baïkonour takes its name from a Soviet missile launch site and the album's title and artwork both imply a certain Sputnik-era retro-futurism. To the contrary, however, these songs remain stubbornly coarse-textured and earthy, even pastoral, as on ""Hoku To Shin Ken"", a track whose circular melody is fed by tranquil, Byrds-like guitar arpeggios. Elsewhere ""Proto-Coeur"" plows a recharged Peter Gunn riff around and through various hairpin turns and blind alleys, while tracks like ""Rusk Plasmique"" and ""60 To 0"" can recall M83's synthesized My Bloody Valentine atmospheres. Throughout the album, Krieger consistently astonishes with the daring breadth of his playing, as he embellishes several otherwise straightforward pop hooks with as much florid ornamentation as good taste will allow. Aside from the occasional submerged whisper, as on the classic-Stereolab echoes of ""2/3/74"", For the Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos contains no vocals or lyrics to speak of, but still the album retains the impression of a cohesive, sequential narrative. Culminating with the vibrant surfside pulse of ""Ultra Lazuli"", the album's plotline feels primarily driven by Krieger's skill at flawlessly integrating the various strands of his musical memory and appetites to recast the familiar in new, evocative shades uniquely his own. And this he does with such an addictively melodic flair that it should be easy for listeners to find space for this album within their lonely hearts.","Rigorous, jazz-inflected musicianship and an inspired navigation of spiraling Krautrock dynamics.

Sala Santa Cecilia,FenneszSakamoto,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7d13d197565213b55c/1:1/w_160/bba338ef.jpg,2005-07-31 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3037-sala-santa-cecilia/,Touch,"Austria's Christian Fennesz is among the most vital artists from the abstract edge of the electronic music spectrum, in part because he never stops growing. Whether he's remixing the indie pop band Junior Boys, immersing himself in improv with Fenn O'Berg and Polwechsel, or crafting dark songs in tandem with David Sylvain, Fennesz is constantly challenging himself while holding on to and developing his core style. That he sometimes fails is a testament to his willingness to step outside his comfort zone. Add one-man entertainment industry Ryuichi Sakamoto to Fennesz' long list of collaborators. This unlikely pair is at present working on an album together, and this teaser EP consists of a single 19-minute track they performed live last year at a festival in Italy. Sakamoto has been working in music too long and in too many contexts to be summed up in a few words. Being a key member of the Yellow Magic Orchestra is a career for most, but for Sakamoto YMO was just the beginning. Since then there have been dozens of records including film scores, vocal pop records, orchestral compositions, and ambient mood music, not to mention a number of acting gigs. Now Sakamoto joins Fennesz shoulder-to-shoulder in front of their laptops to fill a concert hall with challenging computer music. When I finish this review and put Sala Santa Cecilia back on the CD shelf, I'm definitely going to file it with my Fennesz releases. There's no way for me to know for sure who is doing what in this collaboration, but the texture and structure of the music fits nicely alongside the more serene and dreamy passages of Live in Japan. It starts with the two men tuning their machines, playing with and discarding an assortment of eerie and uncertain industrial tones, then locking the pieces that fit into pointy spires of sound. They never stay in one place long, though, as the music is constantly shifting and being bumped off track. During a long stretch of small buzzes and thumps the piece seems adrift and on the verge of floating away into chaos. But then a tender symphonic drone, which sounds to me like it was constructed by a guy with deep understanding of film music and storytelling, pulls the piece back into itself to close with an extremely long and wistful fade to black. Santa Cecilia being the patron saint of church music and this performance having taken place of Rome, it's not hard to read into this piece a kind of gothic drama. The long glitchy passage aside, Sala Santa Cecilia sounds deep and wide, like it was meant to echo inside an enormous room with dark stone walls. If I'm understanding the division of labor correctly, Sakamoto's outsized orchestral flair is an excellent compliment to the more fastidious choices made by Fennesz, and the ideas presented here, while exciting on their own, bode very well for the upcoming full-length.

Clor,Clor,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7419d034d5c69bf374e/1:1/w_160/3865b967.jpg,2005-07-31 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1814-clor/,Regal,"Comparisons can be deal-breakers but what the hell: Clor vocalist Barry Dobbins sounds a little like the Arcade Fire's Win Butler. Well, he does when adding a pained crescendo to the word ""more"" on a song called ""Good Stuff"", from his band's eponymous debut. Other tracks find him tricking out Gary Numan or Robyn Hitchcock c. Soft Boys atop shit-is-bananas synth garb or filching inspirational one-liners (""Each of us is special in our own unique way"") from milquetoast countrymen Embrace. Clor play buzzy, hopped-up indie pop that sounds great with your first caffeine of the day. They're pop in perhaps the most literal sense of the word-- their songs POP out at you, glowing bright blue-green like a Nike tracksuit. Dudes can play, too, and with music this dense (Clor tracks are a frottage of guitar, bass, live drums, drum machine, vocals, and upwards of 14 vintage synthesizers likely purchased on eBay), precision is ne plus ultra. Bios list only five members, which suggests multi-tracking, but that's allowed. These boys nail their notes, and unlike most indie poppers, they can thump. Piloted by chichi sequencers and a house-inflected rhythm, ""Dangerzone"" sounds great coming through walls or from under blankets or with a paper bag over your head. In indie rock, a rigidly self-contained genre whose bands employ strikingly similar sounds and production techniques, the difference between mediocrity and greatness is often, literally, one or two notes. Clor delight in making unexpected stylistic choices. They excel at turning left where most would turn right or not turn at all, and their shiftiness rarely seems forced. Take single ""Love + Pain"". For its first 47 seconds, ""Love + Pain"" teeters on obnoxiousness. Notes bop and bubble in a jittery morass, while Dobbin's nasally vocals claw at nearby skin. It's not bad, just a little nauseating. But then the chorus hits. I'm sorry-- first the prechorus, i.e., the four bars that make all the difference. Instead of launching into the refrain, with its one-line hook and beeline chord changes, Clor prime the canvas with a palate-cleansing arpeggiated riff. Perfect. Like a stand-up comic who overuses shock value, a band can be unpredictable in very predictable ways. Many Clor-type bands use a glitzy, structurally overloaded approach in order to curry favor with bored listeners. But Clor are master blenders, cobbling together tasty unrelated nuggets and making them seem like sonic soul mates. Opener ""Good Stuff"" superimposes a Hives-y quarter-note riff over an ambiguous instrumental backdrop, in which grainy drum machine and chorus-drenched bass invoke post-wavers Poster Children. ""Hearts of Fire"" rubberizes a benumbed Kraftwerk-style motor groove with guitar and vox, both pliant and catchy, before drifting off in an extended instrumental passage featuring more computers than the Very Large Array. They even get mushy on the immaculate ""Gifted"". So it's a bummer the album fizzles a bit toward the end. Clor are so flashy and blemish-free, they're almost celluloid. They work plasticity to their favor mostly-- and damn that's hard-- but ""Magic Touch"", which is wanky, and ""Making You All Mine"", which is unmemorable, leave a divot in this otherwise excellent album. If Clor were a film, they'd be a shimmering (but hardly weightless), FX-laden blockbuster, and those always drag. But as the shimmering (and often weightless), FX-laden albums of its ilk go, you could do much worse.","The label that unearthed the Beta Band introduces this British quintet and their buzzy, thumping indie pop.

Contact Kid,Mixel Pixel,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36213d197565213bd0a/1:1/w_160/5c934d85.jpg,2005-07-28 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5659-contact-kid/,Kanine,"Mixel Pixel are a trio who combine kitschy video-game noises and lo-fi rock. From the crawling beat and dramatic dead stops of the opener, ""I Am the Contact Kid"", this album begs for your attention. Yet while it keeps a consistent sound and atmosphere, Contact Kid would be easier to swallow if it skipped happily by on non-stop Casio beats, but ""I Am the Contact Kid"" and other songs are surprisingly sober. Thin, detuned guitars, distorted drum machines, and bristling garage-sale keyboards all hope to remind you of the lo-fi all-stars in your CD collection, while the vocals are delivered with marbles in the mouth and a tongue in the cheek, Valley-girl style. It's a convincing recreation, but most lo-fi bands work with those production values out of necessity; Mixel Pixel do it for style. They're not the first to record this way just for aesthetics (recent bands like Unicorns and Single Frame spring to mind), but at the very least, those other artists had memorable songs. Nothing about this band is subtle, so the more minimal the songs are, the better: ""Penny Rocket/Romantic"" creeps along on low arpeggios and whispered vocals, and the open space within the song holds as much weight as the instruments. The instrumental ""Gas House Gables"" is a curveball highlight with a deft balance between quirky sound effects and pleasant melody. Yet these moments are few. ""Mantis Rock"" runs through every gimmick at the band's disposal, with the exception of a hook. Cutesy tracks like ""At the Arcade"" sound even more forced and affected (though the video-game breakdown at the end is pretty cool). The singer rants over static and a moseying beat in ""Little Wolverine"", aiming for aloof but ending up dull, and ""Out of My Mind"" is like being stuck in a 5 x 5 room with the most annoying guy at a party-- and he's got an acoustic guitar. While those tracks are grating, they're among the few songs with any impact. There's nothing wrong with wearing your influences on your sleeve, but it's a strange day when harsh, amateur recordings make for inconspicuous background music they way most of Contact Kid does.","Thin, detuned guitars, distorted drum machines, and bristling garage-sale keyboards color this Kanine release.

Tralala,Tralala,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89fc0084474cd0c0e7c/1:1/w_160/1c4b1eb7.jpg,2005-07-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8292-tralala/,Audika,"The first thing you need to know about Tralala is that there's three. That's three syllables, tra-la-la, unless it's tra-la-la. But either way there's actually seven, four girls acclaimed for their bangs plus three guys semi-acclaimed for banging on instruments. They do this to form notes, which can be used for chords. Tralala rely on just a few, sometimes three! But those must be enough because tiny sinus-infected lunch-recess vox fill out the rest, courtesy mostly of the four with bangs. No, not Bangs: Meltzer. Of course three of these guy/girls already maybe know that, having employment experience with the same Greenwich Village record store that birthed Animal Collective. Tralala's kingdom is far simpler: Ramones-y NYC fuzz and girl-group social agony stuck in bubblegum pop. Hello Raveonettes, right? But that's another story for a different subway stop. Tralala are recently corrupted naifs wandering heartsick through a shadowy cinematic Gotham. Except a song like ""The Girls Say"" is pretty seriously solid, put-on or no. It stands out through sheer force of ""ba ba ba-ba ba daaa da"" and yes subtleties like a nervous (please god not pregnant) pause between ""de-"" and ""-flate"" at the end of a line. Our narrator loves a certain boy because he's beautiful-- or is he beautiful because other girls say she should love him? ""I trust my friends, but I can't trust myself,"" she laments, and any critic of the human primate's pack instinct knows that's not a problem of youth alone. For all the handclaps and harmonies, Tralala are at least as not-that-innocent as Skye Sweetnam, with or without her collagen hookup. Too-rote opener ""All Fired Up"" sure sounds like it's about sex. Same with rootsier closer ""Like This"": ""Feels so good, oh baby/ Let's do it again"". Shocking, I know. ""No/Yeah"" even conjures up carnival cruises with ""Lust for Life"" drums and more girlish lust. Sample lyric: ""Am I just some kid to you?"" Bland mimickry also weakens ""Everybody's Doin' Fine"", which reminds us that Judy was a punk before she was a dick slap. All of which brings us back to Number One, bummer your girlfriend says that's gross.","Ramones-y NYC fuzz and girl-group social agony on this new LP from the label that helped reintroduce Arthur Russell.

Four Winds the Walker,Spires That in the Sunset Rise,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b613d197565213924d/1:1/w_160/b9280e12.jpg,2005-07-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7823-four-winds-the-walker/,Secret Eye,"Spires That in the Sunset Rise are a Chicago-based, all-female quartet whose ecstatic, communal psych-folk draws on the same fragrant smoke that fed the otherworldly likes of such vintage acts as Comus, Jan Dukes De Grey, or COB, as well as on the crypto-ethnicity of the Sun City Girls' Carnival Folklore Resurrection series or the Gothic spiritualism of Current 93. On their second album Four Winds the Walker, the foursome emit such inspired gusts of collective fire that they resemble a witches' coven almost as much as a band, their shadow-draped music seeming to issue forth organically from the soil like a sulfurous hot spring. The group consists of Georgia Vallas, Kathleen Baird, Tracy Peterson, and Taralie Peterson, whose supremely scrambled solo work The Artist Revealed is Tarlie Dawn was released under the name Tar Pet earlier this year. Together the four employ a variety of hand percussion and other atypical instrumentation including cello, banjo, African mbira, and Japanese bul bul tarang, all while keeping each musician's individual role fluid and undefined. Hence there is no single lead singer as such, as throughout the album multiple voices swirl and caper from unexpected directions like a swarm of inquisitive fireflies. This freewheeling approach yields strange but alluring fruit on songs like ""Little For a Lot"", where, behind the song's main chorus, the backing vocals appear to be literally mewing like kittens. On more dissonant tracks like ""Sheye"" or the sawing drone of ""Born in a Room"", the vocals sound uncannily like those of Comus' First Utterance, bearing less similarity to traditional pastoral folk than to the theatricality of 70s UK prog-rock. Perhaps most astonishing of all is ""This Ain't For Mama"", a swirling magic carpet of insect-like hums and tribal percussion that is interjected with strident, almost punkish snarls, conjuring something like an imaginary collaboration between Babes in Toyland's Kat Bjelland and the Master Musicians of Jajouka. Many of the most captivating passages on Four Winds the Walker, however, occur when the Spires stretch their songs and put their restlessly inventive combinations of instruments to work. On cuts like ""Ong Song"" or ""Shining"" the group match their curious string instruments and tuned percussion (or perhaps that's the bul bul tarang I'm hearing) in a manner that recalls Harry Partch's hobo jungle, while the cracked hoedown of ""Imaginary Skin"" features some marvelously bent fiddle that eventually gives way to a wordless vocal hayloft serenade. When operating at their peak, which is the case on much of Four Winds the Walker, Spires That in the Sunset Rise can invoke the unbounded, ageless music one might expect to hear emanating from the deepest forest, as mysterious black-cloaked figures dance around the fire-ring. Whether that sounds more like a warning or an invitation is left up to the traveler.","Chicago-based, all-female quartet create ecstatic, communal psych-folk.
