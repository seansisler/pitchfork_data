## Setup
The first group of tasks that I completed for this project was creating a project in GCP where I would have all the tools that I would need to complete my project. I created a compute instance and cloned my GitHub repo for the project so I would transfer files from my local to the virual environment or vice versa. The entirety of this project was completed in Google Cloud Platform with the exception of downloading the Pitchfork dataset that I used from components.one to my local which was then uploaded into the Cloud. The database being more than 50 MB was too large to use GitHub for transfer. 

## Data

I had two main sources of data for this project. I used articles from the New York Times API and a data set provided by components.one with a SQLite database with more than 20,000 Pitchfork album reviews from the beginning of 1999 up to 2019.
