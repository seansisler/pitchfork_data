## Setup
The first group of tasks that I completed for this project was creating a project in GCP where I would have all the tools that I would need to complete my project. I created a compute instance and cloned my GitHub repo for the project so I would transfer files from my local to the virual environment or vice versa. I did the entirety of this project in Google Cloud Platform with the exception of downloading the Pitchfork dataset that I used from components.one to my local which was then uploaded into the Cloud. The database being more than 50 MB was too large to use GitHub for transfer. 

## Data

I had two main sources of data for this project. I used articles from the New York Times API and a data set provided by components.one with a SQLite database with more than 20,000 Pitchfork album reviews from the beginning of 1999 up to 2019.
