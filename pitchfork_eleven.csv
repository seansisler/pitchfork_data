Modern Jester,Aaron Dilloway,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c1c0084474cd0c219a/1:1/w_160/96c1b86f.jpeg,2012-02-27 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16330-modern-jester/,Hanson,"It's been six years since Aaron Dilloway left Wolf Eyes, and he spent half that time making Modern Jester. That's not all he's done-- he's been involved in tons of other releases too, with my favorite being either 2007's rattling Chain Shot or 2008's The Squid, a collaboration with like-minded noise pal C. Spencer Yeh. But in terms of scope and ambition, Modern Jester is Dilloway's War and Peace. It covers practically all of his sonic obsessions, stretching them to lengths at which he can explore every detail and tangent. The result-- seven pieces encompassing four sides of vinyl-- feels like a major statement, even if it's made of wordless, sometimes harsh noise. What exactly is Dilloway trying to say? That's open to interpretation, which is probably his intention. He's into ambiguity, both musically and discographically (he already released a tape called Modern Jester back in 2008, though only one track from that survives here). But as amorphous as his message may be, it's always about the power and attraction of loops. Each track here features some kind of repetitive cycle, whether it's off in the distance or up in your face. Some are lopsided and woozy; others are sharp and punchy; still others are so subtle they're more like ambient atmospheres or dense drones. But dig in deep enough, and you'll find Dilloway repeating some sound, whether miniscule or massive. Those sounds flow together so seamlessly that he's often like a noise DJ, beat-matching his loops so it's hard to tell where each begins and ends. Aptly enough, the piece where he does that best is called ""Body Chaos"", a 19-minute journey taking up all of side two. Portions are like an alternate-universe dance track, as noises melt into each other, burst into anarchic climaxes, then recede into sparse echo. When Dilloway settles into that steady mode, Modern Jester becomes a travelogue where words and pictures are replaced by sonic textures. Such naturalism makes sense given Dilloway's obsession with field recordings. He originally left Wolf Eyes to live in Kathmandu, where he amassed an archive of real-life audio. He released some of it in the fascinating 4xCD-R box set Sounds of Nepal, but he's also used it throughout his solo recordings, and I suspect parts are embedded in Modern Jester. Many moments feel environmental-- at points I imagine a train rolling down tracks, a printing press clacking out sheets of paper, and a power plant chugging smoke into the sky. And even when his music sounds more like a broken circuit or a skipping record, it has the primacy of life's routines-- the way the world seems to loop around you in repetitive patterns as you navigate your way through it. That universality doesn't mean this album is for everyone. It takes some stamina to get lost in these lengthy sound essays. But then Dilloway has never done anything the easy way. If he tried to make his music more accessible, it would likely lose its core power. Instead, he's supremely patient, and he wants you to be, too. If you're up for it, Modern Jester rewards that patience infinitely.","Six years after leaving Wolf Eyes, Aaron Dilloway releases a collection that feels like a major statement, even if it's made of wordless, sometimes harsh noise.

Splendor Squalor,Xray Eyeballs,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b1ea9e61561daa6b2d/1:1/w_160/0c544fa4.jpeg,2012-02-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16317-xray-eyeballs-splendor-squalor/,Kanine,"""They cleaned up their sound."" ""This album is more focused than the last one."" ""They added band members, so the songs are fuller."" All of those statements apply to Splendor Squalor, which is a good thing, right? Xray Eyeballs' debut, Not Nothing, hinted that the band could head in a few directions, so if O.J. San Felipe and Carly Rabalais wanted to fill out their sound, polish the fidelity, and reach for one genre instead of trying out a few, that's a good move. If this sophomore album is evidence of anything, it's that they picked one approach and ran with it: new wave steeped in hollow, jangling synths. It's a look they wore well on parts of Not Nothing, so they could theoretically pull off an album full of it. Sonically, the aesthetic honing works. Their percussion is more clear-eyed and controlled than ever, thanks to new drummer Sarah Baldwin. The synths, from Liz Lohse, bring a welcome new layer to the mix that fills out their sound. The band's octave-separated vocals work well with their new sheen, especially on ""Blue"", where they're especially tight. The case could be made that the jangle and the synths are overly reminiscent of Eyeballs' swooning, 1980s forebears, sure, but since they make up the most dreamy and pleasant moments of Splendor Squalor, it's hard to care. Execution isn't the problem. The main issue here is that when they find a sound they like, they bury themselves in it. For instance, they ruin perfectly good hooks by singing, ""Downtown is such a drag!"" (""Gator"") or ""I control you! You control me!"" (""X"") on near-infinite repeat, to the point that those phrases come to mean nothing. It's made worse by the overall lack of variation in tempo and tone. Each song drags-- it's amazing the record's only 40 minutes long-- and it all culminates in ""Summer Daze"", an excruciating five-minute monotone listing of summertime imagery, including tacos, snow cones, pubes, and DJ Pauly D. Really. Perhaps most telling is that the best song on the album is a cover of a song by Rabalais and San Felipe's other band, Golden Triangle. ""Cold Bones"" gets a shiny new-wave makeover, but despite its status as a Splendor Squalor highlight, it's not as powerful as the original. The Golden Triangle cut has grit in its comparatively cruddy production; this new version has a fresh coat of jangling gloss. Worse is the drum sound, which is brittle compared to the original's robust, powerful drive. ""Four""'s chorus of, ""Take your time, blissful night, big brown eyes, never die/ And fall apart, from the start, lost in love, and have some fun,"" is telling: There's so much love and fun and whimsy here, but it takes forever to deliver. The title Splendor Squalor invokes having a wonderful time despite your poor economic, hygienic, or social condition. That message would've been more effective with editing. Between a few of their choruses and that final tortuous laundry list of summertime activities, fun has never sounded quite so exhausting.","On their beefed-up sophomore collection, the Brooklyn new wave group, featuring members of Golden Triangle, picks one approach and runs with it.

Corrosion of Conformity,Corrosion of Conformity,by: Hank Shteamer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bec0084474cd0c2196/1:1/w_160/709c5f31.jpg,2012-02-27 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16328-corrosion-of-conformity/,Candlelight,"You've likely heard about Van Halen's recent comeback, a surprisingly vital reboot of their classic David Lee Roth incarnation. Considerably further underground, another veteran hard-rock band, Raleigh, N.C.'s three-decade-old Corrosion of Conformity, is answering the same nostalgic muse. As with the Roth and Sammy Hagar Van Halens, it's helpful to think of C.O.C. as two different bands: On one hand, you've got the trio that recorded 1985's Animosity, a whirlwind of a record that drew equally on Bad Brains' frantic sprint and Sabbath's sinister swing, epitomizing what used to be called crossover. On the other, there's the quartet responsible for three far more commercial LPs-- filled with polished but still potent blues-rock, a grunge-era update on Mountain, and other early riff disciples-- from the mid-90s through 2000. Other memorable LPs (including 1991's Blind and 2005's In the Arms of God) featured their own unique lineups, but essentially, the C.O.C. tale amounts to Animosity vs. Deliverance, the 1994 Columbia album that spawned two minor alt-rock hits. Corrosion of Conformity indulges in revisionist history. The lineup here is the same one that recorded Animosity-- bassist-vocalist Mike Dean, guitarist Woodroe Weatherman, and drummer-vocalist Reed Mullin-- and in the absence of 1994-2005 frontman Pepper Keenan (currently focusing on the Southern-metal supergroup Down but rumored to be returning to the C.O.C. fold), the three set the Delorean controls back to 1987, just after the still-punkish Technocracy EP and just before maturity set in. Dean, Weatherman, and Mullin reconvened in 2010 to revisit the 1980s material live-- see them if you can; they sound amazing-- and now they're adding to that repertoire, crafting as fortysomethings a record they never got around to in their 20s. As enjoyable as the Keenan-centric records were, they could seem labored, as if someone were angling for a breakthrough à la Soundgarden, or even White Zombie; on Corrosion of Conformity, those ambitions go right out the window. It's not quite as simple as that. COC is a much more varied, shrewdly paced record than Animosity, yet it still seethes with a swampy rawness that the band hasn't embraced since the 1980s. Part of that is due to principal frontman Mike Dean, whose unhinged whine, at once ugly and profoundly soulful, rarely aspires to anything so civilized as singing, whereas Keenan had developed into a full-on crooner by the time he left the band. A crisp, no-nonsense production job (realized with the help of Dave Grohl, a longtime C.O.C. fan who lent out his L.A. studio for the project) and a purist avoidance of Pro Tools-y perfectionism also help; the performances often sound like they're coming unglued, and that adds greatly to the record's old-school charm. Corrosion of Conformity does overstay its welcome with a couple of second-rate tracks, but overall, the album manages to both recapture Animosity's feral energy and reach compositional peaks that the 1985 versions of Dean, Weatherman, and Mullin couldn't have accessed. A few songs simply recap the Animosity template. In the opening seconds of lead track ""Psychic Vampire"", Weatherman crunches into a bulky doom riff and Dean lets out a cathartic groan, like he's casting off the weight of the previous two decades, during which C.O.C. traded caffeinated adolescence for grown-up discernment. Bass and drums enter, and the trio quickly accelerates to a hardcore gallop. The tempo change feels like a secret handshake with longtime fans: The creature lives, and he's wearing a flipped-up skate cap, Vans, and baggy jean shorts. Crucially, though, there's much more to Corrosion of Conformity than strict reanimation. As good as Animosity is, only a few songs stand out from amid the blur; here, many of the tracks feel lived-in, nearly epic. If C.O.C. ever compile a greatest-hits comp (and they really should, given their diffuse discography), ""River of Stone"" belongs on it. Dean's possessed wail-- like the raving of a crazed seer-- leads the band through a chugging blues-metal verse and a grinding half-time chorus. The trio downshifts into an eerie, molasses-slow bridge, and the track takes on a somber grandeur that trumps both Animosity and the Keenan era for sheer emotive power. By the time the verse returns, you sense the song's proggish sweep; C.O.C. aren't just switching tempos, they're taking you on a journey. The driving anti-government rant ""Your Tomorrow"" is another standout. C.O.C. previewed the track on a 2010 Southern Lord 7"", but the new version ups the intensity; Weatherman's riffs writhe grotesquely, as if they were playing him rather than the other way around, and Dean and Mullin add a shaggy, drunken-giant swing. The trio sounds as commanding here as it ever has, thriving on proud anti-virtuosity: punk spirit inhabiting a metal anatomy. As a whole, Corrosion of Conformity is smartly sequenced for maximum variety. ""Leeches"", a bellowed hardcore outburst, sits next to the album's lone instrumental, ""El Lamento de Las Cabras"", drumless desert blues shaded with acoustic guitar; and the prog-punk mini suite ""The Moneychangers"" (part cowbell-abetted uptempo shimmy, part Floydian mood piece) segues into the proudly grungy doom-rocker ""Come Not Here"" (the record's clearest link to the Pepper Keenan years). It's a shame, then, that Corrosion of Conformity's two least-memorable tracks, the macho kiss-off ""What We Become"" and the 1983-style mosh-pit singalong ""Rat City"", follow one another late in the album. The songs add drag to an otherwise admirably streamlined LP. (Spring for the vinyl or deluxe CD versions, and you get two top-drawer bonus tracks, ""Canyon Man"" and ""The Same Way"".) Uneven patch aside, Corrosion of Conformity is what you want out of a comeback record: not just a reclamation of lost vigor but a meaningful update on a vintage sound. If Animosity seemed like an ugly duckling back in the mid 1980s-- too punk for the metal crowd and vice versa*-- Corrosion of Conformity* registers similarly today. In an era when doom metal keeps growing bleaker and artier, and hardcore skews ever more dire, the album serves as a reminder that swagger, soul, and songcraft still have a place in the heavy-rock underground. Corrosion of conformity, indeed.","For their first album in seven years, the classic heavy-rock trio crafted the album they never got around to in their 20s, an LP recorded in Dave Grohl's studio that seethes with a swampy rawness they haven't embraced since the 1980s.

1966,Karen Dalton,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3aa13d197565213a99e/1:1/w_160/c4666d6e.jpeg,2012-02-27 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16312-karen-dalton-1966/,Delmore,"Picture the great American folk artists of the 1960s and 70s sitting for a group portrait; Karen Dalton's there, but her figure's a blur, flitting restlessly out of frame. Dalton hated recording and felt at best ambivalent about performing in front of strangers (she much preferred playing for friends, on porches and in living rooms), which means that although she's got one of those voices that gets talked about in hushed, reverent tones by everyone from Bob Dylan to Devendra Banhart, she preferred to sit out the kind of rituals that secure a person a snug spot in the canon. She didn't don face paint and a gypsy costume and hit the road with the Rolling Thunder Revue, she didn't dance The Last Waltz under Scorsese's spotlights, and-- years after her flight from Greenwich Village to Colorado-- she's present on the Basement Tapes only as the elusive subject of Richard Manuel's beguiled plea: ""Dear Katie, if you can hear me…/ How much longer will you be gone?"" Dalton has a Mona Lisa voice: it gestures toward a whole universe of unknowable things, and the way it makes notes curl up at the corners seems to suggest-- no matter how sad the song-- that its keeper is slyly smiling to herself about something you'll never quite comprehend. I can think of few better examples of this quality of her voice than her arresting take on Tim Hardin's ""Reason to Believe"", which opens 1966, the latest collection of unearthed Dalton recordings. The song's most famous version, Rod Stewart's 1971 cover, is all stomping melodrama, and even Hardin's comparatively subdued original has an air of tragedy: It is an accusation, a wounded person blaming an unfaithful lover. Dalton finds something else in the song. Her gentle cascade of finger-picked notes and plaintive, drama-free vocals (""If I listen long enough to you/ I'd find a way to believe that it's all true"") turn the song into something of a koan: It becomes an acceptance of love's co-existing light and shadow. She sings the same words as Stewart and Hardin, but in her care they take on an entirely different meaning. Like so many of her other classics-- her versions of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" and ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)"" come to mind-- the track presents a solid argument that Dalton (who never wrote any material of her own) is one of the most subtly skilled interpreters in the history of American folk. The Oklahoma-born Dalton put out just two studio albums in her lifetime, 1969's It's So Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You the Best and 1971's In My Own Time. In the past few years, though, the number of Dalton tracks known to the world has more than doubled, thanks to two reissues from the Delmore Recording Society: the home recordings of Green Rocky Road, and the double-disc Cotton Eyed Joe. The latter is the Karen Dalton equivalent of a live album: just she and her 12-string, deftly plucking traditional folk numbers in a Colorado bar called the Attic, the end of each track punctuated by the applause of maybe a few dozen people. It's a mesmerizing performance, and comparing Cotton Eyed Joe against some of the more bombastic live records of her contemporaries, its unpretentious intimacy is as refreshing as a breath of mountain air. 1966 finds Dalton in a setting even more intimate: her own cabin in Colorado, rehearsing with her estranged husband, fellow Village ex-pat Richard Tucker. Dalton had no intention for these songs to be recorded; the 14 tracks here exist only because Tucker's friend Carl Baron brought a portable reel-to-reel over one day and captured the couple preparing for an upcoming gig. Some tracks feature Dalton solo, and some feature her and Tucker together, working out the kinks of some the duets in their repertoire, like ""Mole in the Ground"" or Fred Neil's ""Other Side to This Life"". As their voices and guitar stylings unite and occasionally veer off into imperfect harmony, 1966's more unpolished moments invite a glimpse into their process, while the occasional snippets of dialogue from the couple (who split shortly after) straddle the line between poignancy and black comedy. ""Wow, what an ending, we just did it perfect,"" Tucker sighs at the end of a rendition of Hardin's ""Shiloh Town"". ""No, we didn't,"" Dalton mutters. ""I didn't know what you were doing."" The material on 1966 spotlights two songwriters in particular (and two of Dalton's closest friends): blues-folkie Neil and confessional songwriting pioneer Hardin. Neil's ""Little Bit of Rain"" and Hardin's ""While You're on Your Way"" would later become some of Dalton's signature tunes, but these are the earliest known recordings of her interpretations. 1966 was also the year that Hardin released his acclaimed debut, Tim Hardin 1; shortly before Baron's recordings, Hardin had traveled to Colorado to personally play his new songs for Dalton and Tucker. Since she was used to singing almost exclusively traditionals before 1966, there's something moving about how many of the songs on 1966 are penned by either Hardin or Neil (who released his own classic Bleecker & MacDougal a year prior). By bringing them into her oeuvre, Dalton's saying she thinks the songs her friends were writing were just as good as the classics (and they way they're juxtaposed here show that she was right), and her adapting them to her own style foreshadows the forays into contemporary pop she'd explore on In My Own Time. Dalton had a hard life: She struggled with a drug addiction that she never overcame, and she was more or less homeless when she died in New York in 1993. 1966 augments her legend not by romanticizing the tragedy of her life, but instead by showing the skill and depth of feeling that Dalton brought to even her most informal performances. It was an ordinary evening that Baron captured on his reel-to-reel, and the moments when his recorder drops out (like the clipped 40 seconds of ""Hallelujah"", as if snatched from the ether, that conclude the disc) only add to this collection's poetry-- they suggest the hundreds, maybe thousands of other times that Dalton played sets like this one for nobody in particular. Another testament to the riveting power of her music, 1966 is one more piece to a puzzle that will never be complete-- which is of course how Dalton herself would have had it.","Captured by a friend on a portable reel-to-reel, this 14-song collection finds the late folk singer in a cabin in Colorado, rehearsing for an upcoming show with her (soon-to-be-ex) husband.

Put Your Back N 2 It,Perfume Genius,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c913d197565213a9ce/1:1/w_160/347b95c5.jpeg,2012-02-27 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16335-put-your-back-n-2-it/,Matador,"How do we deal with personal trauma? After it's over, what comes next? These are some of the Big Questions Seattle singer/songwriter Mike Hadreas addresses on his second album as Perfume Genius. Put Your Back N 2 It follows Hadreas' overlooked 2010 debut, Learning, and it feels like a proper sequel to that album's suite of dysfunction and devastation. On his first album, Hadreas tackled subjects such as molestation, substance abuse, suicide, the complications of inappropriate sexual relationships, and the struggle for acceptance from those you love. The morose subject matter and melodic simplicity of Learning's piano-based songs drew comparisons to indie-pop artists like Stephin Merritt and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone's Owen Ashworth. But Hadreas' ability to set a scene and convey detail, which brought to mind Sufjan Stevens circa Seven Swans, lent the songs extra force. There were moments of impressionistic, synth-smeared beauty on that first record, but the overriding sense of despair and hopelessness could be overwhelming. On Put Your Back N 2 It, there's a crack of light coming through the darkness. Hadreas is still exploring the more harrowing corners of human behavior. ""Dark Parts"" details the abuse his mother suffered at the hands of her grandfather; opener ""AWOL Marine"" takes inspiration from a tape of homemade pornography that Hadreas viewed, in which one of the participants admits, camera still rolling, that he's just trying to get medication for his wife. ""Floating Spit"" also deals with drug addiction, ""Take Me Home"" explores prostitution in the context of the need to be loved, while ""17"" uses a metaphor of a body stuffed into a violin, covered in semen, and hung up on a fence to shine a light on corrosive self-loathing. So don't let the whimsical album title fool you: If you're looking for something low-key to vibe out to, you've come to the wrong place. The ""light"" the album allows has to do with how Hadreas approaches the material. He has a brilliant feel for poetic imagery (""The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes/ But still he broke the elastic on your waist,"" from ""Dark Parts"", is particularly haunting), but he's mostly moved away from storytelling to explore emotional themes at their most fundamental. Put Your Back N 2 It is an album about love-- what happens when we feel sheltered by it, how we fail to love ourselves and the people around us-- but amidst the heartache and bruised tenderness, there's hope, too. Hadreas sums it all up in the hollowed-out torch song ""No Tear"": ""I will carry on with grace."" For all its violence, Back radiates warmth. Much of the beauty is due to the expanded instrumentation, from the swooning, countryish guitar bends of ""Take Me Home"" to the interspersed snare rolls on ""No Tear"". The brutal low fidelity of Learning is gone, replaced with clarity and sonic intimacy that, when paired with these rich songs, raises every hair on the back of your neck. The more expansive sound gives room for experimentation, from the submerged electronic percussion on ""Floating Spit"" (contributed by UK producer David Edwards, aka Minotaur Shock) to the robust and surprising full-band blast of ""Hood"". The latter, with its bloom-and-burst structure, is the perfect example of Hadreas' growth as a melodic songwriter, having moved well beyond the the functional melodies that marked Learning. Many of these songs-- ""Hood"", ""All Waters"", ""Take Me Home"", ""17""-- forego resolution and basically build tension and drop everything, in silence. Hadreas likes to steer clear of cathartic release, since in this world, there is no easy way out. On ""All Waters"", he begins singing in a low register and ends in his highest falsetto, as the song dissolves in wordless cries and frissons of far-away distortion. The song is a wish for a world where he and his boyfriend, Alan Wyffels (who also serves as his main musical collaborator), can hold hands in public without fear, and the lyrics (""When all waters still/ And flowers cover the earth"") suggest that it's not going to happen any time soon. Mike Hadreas is gay, and many of the songs here focus on the issues that young gay men face in their lives (he referred to ""17"" in a press release as ""a gay suicide letter""), even as Back's sustained exploration of love and hate has resonance for anyone. There is a lot of him in this music, the minutiae obviously pulled from a single person's life and experiences. But the album is less about confession as a form of release and more about trying to bring something positive into the world. ""I don't want it to seem like I've been through more than other people..."", he says in promotional materials for the album. ""Staying healthy can be more depressing and confusing than being fucked up. But I want to make music that's honest and hopeful."" With so much recent conversation about marriage equality and gay teen suicide, and with the predictable election-year demonization of homosexuality, Mike Hadreas' work is not only satisfying on a purely musical level, it also feels of-the-moment and above all necessary (it's so topical, he found himself in the middle of a standards-of-decency ""family values"" battle earlier this year between his label, Matador, and internet-media titans Google and YouTube). Independent music has woefully few artists dealing with these issues and asking difficult questions, and doing so in a context that never forgets about the importance of songwriting. That's a disappointment, but at least a handful of people like Hadreas are doing something about it.","Mike Hadreas' powerful second album addresses personal traumas like physical abuse, drug addiction, and desperation, but, unlike his 2010 debut Learning, some light shines through the darkness.

Hairdresser Blues,Hunx,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3abb1335d7bf169a622/1:1/w_160/7c65af34.jpeg,2012-02-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16313-hairdresser-blues/,Hardly Art,"Seth Bogart, better known as Hunx, has been spending the past few years upending the certain heteronormative rock'n'roll clichés, whether through creating a girl-group with himself at the center, or through subverting the machismo of 1950s greaser icons by adding a liberal dose of glammy homoeroticism. Last year's Too Young to Be in Love proved to be a valuable contrast to the heterosexuality of first-wave rock'n'roll, but more importantly, it was an enjoyable garage-pop record. Bogart and his ""punkettes"" sounded like they had a ball recording it, embracing the kitsch of malt-shop soundtracks. And while the album certainly possessed the air of ""sock hop night"" at your favorite gay bar, it also had a universal emotional core, with many of the songs detailing the highs and lows of teenage infatuation-- which, in spite of what you're told, doesn't get much more mature when you enter young adulthood. When it was announced that Bogart would record a solo album, speculation arose. A Hunx record with no punx, no punkettes, and no Shannon Shaw to potentially steal the show. Is Bogart heading into pensive singer/songwriter territory? Would he go from the unbridled fun of Too Young to Be in Love to releasing his own Nebraska? Recorded by Bogart and Too Young producer Ivan Julian (with help from Daniel Pitout of British Columbia punk band Nü Sensae on drums), Hairdresser Blues finds Hunx reflecting on the past in a major way, writing ballads to his old friend Jay Reatard, his departed father, and the Bay City Rollers. With the newfound emotional weight comes punchier production and fuller arrangements, sacrificing the girl-group harmonies of songs like ""Lovers Lane"" for driving surf-rock numbers and Flying Nun-indebted Farfisa organs. The songs still traverse into the realm of Nifty Fifties homage by way of pastiche à la Hairspray (""Do You Remember Being a Roller?"", right down to the title, is the album's most overt nod), many of them still carry an undercurrent of writhing lust. (Hint: ""Private Room"" isn't exactly about those spaces in the library hallway with the opaque glass doors.) But whereas Too Young to Be in Love was the excited doodles of a crush's name in a notebook, Hairdresser Blues is the discarding of the love letters that came after. Most of the album's songs finds Bogart singing about wanting to turn the clock back to past experience, the time-honored method of dealing with bleak periods by thinking about simpler times. ""Say Goodbye Before You Leave"" is an ode to Reatard, with Bogart singing of the fun he had opening for him on tour and their late-night phone conversations, wishing he could run his fingers through his hair or just hang out one more time. (When he sings, ""We can talk about girls,"" in the second verse, there's a clear hint of compromise in his voice, a plea that they could do whatever he wants to do, as long as he just comes back.) Closer ""When You're Gone"" is the classic case of when a departed loved one feels like a phantom limb, when it hasn't quite sunk in that someone is gone for good, and all you do is wait for them to come back. Like Too Young to Be in Love closer ""Blow Me Away"", the song is about his father, who passed away when Bogart was a teenager. Through heartbreak and death, Hairdresser Blues is very much an album about loss and the different ways it affects us. But the darker recesses of Bogart's memory are tempered with moments of levity, the moments of waiting up for someone who's never coming back sitting alongside dreams of Bogart having a blow dryer between his thighs.","The solo debut from the Hunx and His Punx frontman finds him reflecting on the past, writing ballads to his old friend Jay Reatard, his departed father, and the Bay City Rollers.

Underrated Silence,Ulrich SchnaussMark Peters,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bb5e6ef959693224ce/1:1/w_160/8118f637.jpeg,2012-02-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16325-underrated-silence/,Bureau B,"Ulrich Schnauss knows what he likes, namely the amorphous rush of shoegaze and the swooning teenage dreams of 1980s synth-pop and goth at its most feathery and unthreatening, all of it run through a slick spritz of turn-of-the-millennium IDM. And he's been giving it to us for over a decade now, both solo and as a member of Engineers, regardless of whether or not these homages to 4AD's imperial years and the less convoluted side of Warp offer anything new or vibrant. Schnauss has managed to make a career for himself on being just pleasant enough to keep you from turning off any of his records in mid-flow, but I can't think of any Schnauss track that's surprised me or stuck with me or compelled me to click ""repeat."" And even if you class Schnauss as an ambient artist, well, even the best ambient music makes you want to linger in its world for one more play. The very title of Underrated Silence, his new collaboration with fellow Engineer Mark Peters, poses a probably unintentional, sort of mean but not entirely unfair, question about Schnauss' approach. Given the terabytes of sound you've probably amassed at this point, is enjoying a few moments of silence preferable to filling that time with something this pretty but anodyne, well-made but insubstantial, polite to the point of barely registering? All the familiar notes from Schnauss projects past are struck here, and once again they all verge on stirring some emotion without usually doing so. More unfortunate are the moments when Schnauss and Peters aim for surprising or affecting and veer straight into kitsch. ""The Child or the Pigeon"" wants to be some sort of pastoral ambient/folk hybrid and winds up bringing to mind a new age album that John Denver never got around to making. Elsewhere the borrowings are both more blatant and less icky, but nonetheless bland when strung together. ""Forgotten"" somehow manages to evoke a half-dozen familiar sounds-- Julee Cruise coos, Tangerine Dream synths, Cure gloom, the tick-tock rhythms of early electronic music-- without managing to evoke much in you, the listener. ""Amoxicilin"" is to Frippertronics what generic caffeine-free diet cola is to chasing slugs of Red Bull with spoonfuls of sugar. There's been no shortage of this sort of ethereal strum-and-woosh (with or without beats) over the last 25 years, but every so often someone will come along with a take that makes it all seem grand (if not exactly revelatory) once again. Schnauss is never going to be that guy, and at this point you're either okay with that or you stopped listening around 2006. Way back then, Pitchfork's Mark Richardson wrote that Schnauss' music ""begs for a riskier approach, something with bolder strokes and an infusion of drama that risks cheesiness."" Six years later, that remains truer than ever, and while there's nothing wrong with being the kind of musician who fixes on small gestures and easily identifiable reference points, the luster is still steadily wearing away from Schnauss' bricolaged miniatures.","The German-born ambient artist collaborates with Mark Peters, his bandmate in the dream-pop band Engineers, on a collection of ethereal strum-and-woosh.

Audience of One,Oren Ambarchi,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b7c0084474cd0c218b/1:1/w_160/e3d800c2.jpeg,2012-02-24 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16320-audience-of-one/,Touch,"It's a strange kind of fate that has caused Australian multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi to spend most of his career making records that demonstrated his singular guitar sound, only to gain greater notice for an album that barely shows it off at all. But that's the way Audience of One, released by his longtime label Touch, is panning out. Ambarchi is also known for his collaborative work with Sunn O))), with whom he's recorded and played live, complementing his extensive solo releases and further alliances with musicians including Keiji Haino, Jim O'Rourke, and Christian Fennesz. Other guests emerge on Audience of One's four pieces. Among them are impressive contributions from Warm Ghost's Paul Duncan, providing vocals on the opening ""Salt""; and Eyvind Kang, filling out a chamber arrangement on the expansive ""Knots"". There's a sense of new life forming, of Ambarchi's re-contextualizing his place in the world. His music has taken in vast stylistic shifts in the past, but here he forges deeper into the unknown, loosening control over his work to allow his collaborators to leave a more indelible footprint and pushing many of the shapes he forms into a tighter framework. Those shapes on the opening ""Salt"" mirror the glass-like ambience of Markus Popp's Oval, sifting a stilled beauty into the track as Duncan's keening vocal echoes softly over them. When a hushed swell of strings momentarily enters the frame it scrapes close to the kind of work Jason Pierce was experimenting with circa Pure Phase, where a chilly tone-drift provides a simple backdrop for raw, unhampered emotion. That may be a surprising comparison for longstanding fans of Ambarchi's work, but on Audience of One he's clearly happy to buck a few expectations. On the 33-minute centerpiece ""Knots"", there's a greater widening of his vision, bringing in the pitter-patter of drummer Joe Talia's metronomic ride-cymbal playing, initially counterbalanced by shards of abstract noise, ranging from barely extant slivers of sound to a blackened, all-encompassing bedlam. It's strung up in an unusual space, full of gaps for the musicians to move around in but also striding forward with purpose and goal, ricocheting back and forth between the known and the unknown. It's reminiscent of Thomas Fehlmann's work with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra on ""DFM"", where all the players are intuitively aware of how to expand into spaces without overwhelming the track's fragile fabric. ""Knots"" is intricate and fascinating, the kind of piece that's impossible to digest in one or two hearings, always holding back secrets to reveal on further plays. There's a lightness and a density to it, with Ambarchi's black-hole soloing at the midway point falling back into near-quiet in the final third before a series of forceful, metallic clangs push and pull it to a barbed close. The only way out after that is to return to the buttoned-up euphoria of what came before, with singer Jessika Kenney cooing over ""Passage"" while Ambarchi caresses out ambient noise by kneading the rims of a series of wine glasses. It's a necessary climb-down from ""Knots"", an escape hatch that stops the mind from reeling on what came before. To complete the picture, and to continue the strain of reinvention that runs throughout Audience of One, the album closes with a cover of Ace Frehley's ""Fractured Mirror"". It's a marginal lift in tone after ""Passage"", with the plush march of a drum machine providing a steady pulse for glass-cut guitar playing to echo around. In 2004, Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy reviewed Ambarchi's Grapes from the Estate, wondering what the guitarist could do with Van Halen's ""Hot for Teacher"". ""Fractured Mirror"" may be the closest we get to an answer, with the overabundant guitar playing of Frehley's version sucked out and replaced with a downplayed beauty that's just about perceptible if you listen closely to the original. But that's typical of Ambarchi's approach on Audience of One, which feels like he's listening harder than ever to feel out new ways to move forward, causing him to quietly cleanse his vision in ever more compelling ways.","Across four pieces, including a cover of Ace Frehley's ""Fractured Mirror"", it feels like the Australian multi-instrumentalist is listening harder than ever to feel out new ways to move forward.

Recollected,Hood,by: Ned Raggett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3525e6ef95969322438/1:1/w_160/9f6947b3.jpg,2012-02-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16248-recollected/,Domino,"The Leeds, England-based Hood, now some years into a relaxed hiatus following 2005's Outside Closer, are one of many bands that should have been deservedly famous. Then again, one gets a feeling in listening to their music that such a circumstance would have been contrary to everything about their art. Following in the vein of such personal musical heroes as Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Disco Inferno, brothers Chris and Richard Adams, plus a continually rotating group of supporting players, went from a pleasant if sometimes derivative start-- in their case including numerous short, sometimes fragmentary lo-fi tape experiments and rushed songs that were very early-1990s indie-- to a different place, a blend of something modern and timeless, suffused with an apparent serenity that in reality was never entirely at ease with the rest of the universe. A fairly big claim, perhaps, but as the six-disc box set Recollected makes clear, the end results can be described almost in no other way. It's not a full career overview-- that would have meant a literal doubling in the size of the set, counting all their other archival efforts and earliest albums, including four CDs' worth of singles and compilation appearances alone-- but a close focusing on their work for the Domino label: four albums, a one-disc collection of singles and EPs, and an expanded reissue of their post-Outside Closer tour CD, The Hood Tapes, plus liner notes, photographs, and further details. Due to longer song lengths and the production and touring membership of Third Eye Foundation's Matt Elliott, Rustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys, their full length Domino debut from 1998, was seen at the time as a contextual response to acts such as Mogwai as well as a more formal allegiance to a drone-rock scene at the other end of the country in Bristol. But it now sounds like its own genteel creation, ominous but not empty, referencing nature and time, while hints of the modern seep in through the arrangements-- consider the almost glitch-like feel of ""The Light Reveals the Place"", elements suddenly stopping and starting even while the overall flow continues. The dry but wounded speak-singing of the Adams siblings often felt more isolated as a result, distant cries from the titular locations. 1999's The Cycle of Days and Seasons felt like a slight return given the shorter songs, including three brief instrumentals, but the mood of cryptic contemplation remained central, skeletal arrangements with lots of space in the mix filled by equally cryptic noises and textures. Voices echo and loop, a slightly fuzzy recording of church bells recurs at points during the album, and the crackle and buried beats of ""In Iron Light"" implicitly suggest what else was happening in the sonic universe. That one particularly delicate, focused number, following in the vein of earlier self-referential titles, is called ""Hood Is Finished"" acts as both in-joke and summary: The band's approach had become so beautifully refined that it almost seemed as if anything further could be gilding the lily. This made the shift evident on 2001's Cold House all the more appealing. From the opening full-on glitch loop of one of three cloudDEAD collaborations, ""They Removed All Trace That Anything Had Ever Happened Here"", set against a still understated but more cleanly energetic performance from the group, there's a clear sense of having turned a corner. The feeling of real dislocation as aesthetic move was now fully clear, a more frenetic, in-the-moment atmosphere complementing and sometimes disrupting but never overwhelming the calm they'd already established. A song like ""I Can't Find My Brittle Youth"" is almost them in anthemic Wedding Present territory but in ""You Show No Emotion At All"" they had a perfect single showcasing their latest approach-- crisply propulsive, poised, and still reticent, guitars and keyboards as pinpoint touches and horn arrangements as a further startling glaze around a poised vocal performance about concern and distance. If Outside Closer turns out to be the final album Hood release, then it found them building on Cold House's new balance extremely well-- if ""The Negatives..."" was, again, at heart, a softly sung contemplation, its arrangement was practically a soul stomper in context, with shimmering samples and melodies swirling throughout. ""Winter 72"" and ""Closure"", in turn, worked with techniques clearly inspired by dub while the stellar ""The Lost You"", a kaleidoscopic collage of beats and shifting arrangements, found Hood just as indebted to Timbaland as to Disco Inferno's Ian Crause or Talk Talk's Mark Hollis. Earlier glitch fascinations continued elsewhere on songs like ""Any Hopeful Thoughts Arrive"" with further depth and detail, arrangements building steadily into dramatic conclusions. The EPs collection mostly covers the latter half of the period, starting with 2001's ""Home Is Where it Hurts"", capturing the group in a transitional space and continuing through the B-sides for ""The Lost You"" and ""The Negatives..."", including fine songs such as ""The World Touches Too Hard"", ""Over the Land, Over the Sea"", and ""Across the Lonely Writing Side"". A key number is at the start, however-- ""Useless"", a 1997 vinyl A-side that many fans consider the band's best, capturing their Disco Inferno fascination for the unexpectedly anthemic with a mix of rough guitar, very Crause-like vocals, and a low-key woodwind melody. The bulk of The Hood Tapes covers rough and ready sessions following Outside Closer, less detailed but as always exploring various acoustic/electronic combinations, with further rarities including the lovely tour-only single ""Winter Will Set You Back"", a rare dip into full acoustic/string waters, and the split-single effort ""You Shins Break My Heart"", an engaging interpolation of Talk Talk's ""New Grass""'s core arrangement into their own approach. It's a bit overwhelming to take in all at once, and each disc's strengths almost come out better in isolation. But as a welcome and well-deserved overview, Recollected covers the continuing evolution of a band that, having established a strong identity over time, then proceeded to transform it to avoid repetition of what it'd already achieved. Would that more performers could be so bold, and secure enough in themselves to feel that taking a break is no bad thing.","Since 1990, the Leeds, England-based post-rock group Hood have created a blend of something modern and timeless. This six-disc set is not a full career overview, but a close focusing on their work for the Domino label.

Parastrophics,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c4b1335d7bf169a63a/1:1/w_160/fa80ebbf.jpeg,2012-02-24 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16331-parastrophics/,Monkeytown,"You don't expect bands like Mouse on Mars to be around for two decades. When Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma debuted under that name in 1994 with Vulvaland, a pillowy-soft album that found threads between UK post-rock and ambient house, other artists on their label included Th' Faith Healers, Moonshake, Seely, and Laika, bands that would be pretty much done by the turn of the millennium. But Mouse on Mars endured and, though they never ""broke through"" in any real sense, they've managed to remain part of the conversation. They stayed relevant by adapting and changing, applying their mastery of music-making technology (which was changing rapidly in those early years) to a distinct sense of structure. Mouse on Mars albums such as Autoditacker and Glam sounded futuristic in their own way, but their charms had less to do with the way they pushed the limits of sound design and more to do with how you tended to remember things like chord changes, melodies, rhythms. The band's sense of experimentation ramped up in the 2000s, as they tried their hand at straight electro-pop (Radical Connector), collaborated with Mark E. Smith of the Fall as Von Südenfed, and made excursions into dense, abrasive sound that bordered on noise music (Varcharz). After that, they went away for a while, working on side projects (Jan St. Werner with his Lithops alias, Andi Toma doing studio collaborations with bands including Junior Boys) and now they return with their best record since 2001's hyper-eclectic Idiology. While that release found them dabbling in mutant ska, blown-out noise, and lush acoustic instrumentals, Parastrophics is diverse within narrower parameters. This is very much an electronic album, though it covers a tremendous amount of ground in that broad terrain. What's most striking about Parastrophics is how, despite sounding very much like Mouse on Mars and in some ways coming over as a throwback to the dense, colorful style they were perfecting between 1997 to 1999, it sounds very much in tune with the maximalist electronics of the moment. Since their comparatively muted first two albums, St. Werner and Toma have not been known for restraint; if there's an open part of the sonic spectrum, they're going to fill it. But while current artists like Rustie and Flying Lotus foreground technology, packing their tracks full in a way that makes you think of a bent and shaped data stream, Mouse on Mars have a weird knack for putting the technology of the music in the background. The songs here are music first and sound excursions second. And they manage to string a staggering number of tightly packed nuggets of melody and texture into 46 minutes. Parastrophics flows like a suite, with very few pauses and chances to catch your breath. Everything is constantly in motion. One moment there are string-like stabs that sound pulled out of the score from the factory scene in Modern Times, another there's a swooning slide guitar that brings to mind a plasticized version of Hawaiian tiki; there are bass drops and ""Numbers""-like synth pulses and voices that are looped and even sort of rap. The lines between tracks, instruments, and genres are continually blurred, but it never feels incoherent. The defining aspect of that sensibility is something that is very rare indeed in the world of electronic music: Mouse on Mars are funny. It's hard to talk about instrumental music in terms of humor, but Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma make music that is playful and sometimes even silly. Part of it is their sound palette, which tends to favor cartoony bleeps and squelches and toots, and part of it is their feel for rhythm, which always injects a charming bit of awkwardness into the beats. So while the playful spatter-house of ""Polaroyced"" can get heavy, and the bouncy electro of ""They Know Your Name"" has a tough low end, these tracks are also shot through with goofiness, a sort of exaggerated top-heavy strut. But if the textures and beats are winking and mischievous, the overall sense of musical structure is dead serious and, ultimately, virtuosic. The songs grow, change, build, and resolve, and never stay in one place for long. They are surprising, filled with non sequiturs that tend to accrue logic with repeated listens. They can be strange, crawling, drone-ridden things with pinched, heavily processed vocals, such as ""Syncropticians"", or they stream-roll with a rapid-fire rap and industrial grind that bring to mind Mu's ""Lets Get Sick"". The peculiar genius of Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma is that they make all these things sound like they could come from no one else. The fact that they are still doing it 18 years after their first album, and still capable of making some of the best music of their career, is inspiring.","After a six-year pause, Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma return with their best record since 2001's hyper-eclectic Idiology.

808 Mafia,Various Artists,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b5b1335d7bf169a62c/1:1/w_160/512d22f6.jpeg,2012-02-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16322-808-mafia-808-mafia/,Brick Squad Monopoly,"The Lex Luger beat-- an ugly tangle of glitching rhythms, hissing hi-hats, and booming low-end-- currently dominates urban radio. Its ubiquity isn't a surprise. Rap is forever falling in love with a production style and then shamelessly squeezing all the life out of it. But at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, something is different this time around. It's all a bit more numbing than usual. Thanks to computer technology, which makes spot-on mimicry quite easy, and facilitated by the industry's embrace of ruthlessly utilitarian music (see also: dubstep, four-on-the-floor euro-pop), there's no demand to gently tweak the Lex Luger formula. 808 Mafia, Lex and fellow Atlanta producer Southside's personal crew of guys mining the Luger sound (Be-Bop, Bobby Beats, Purps, Tarentino, and Trackman), are creative enough to keep this rapidly aging-out style vital. The joy of this mixtape is hearing it done by originator-approved copycats and observing the way that each production subtly differentiates itself from the other. Often, it's with something as simple as throwing in a distinctive sound, like the flickering synth on Be-Bop's ""Gold 2"" or the thick, Vangelis score fog in the background of ""Ripe"" by Tarentino. On the best tracks, though, it's a precarious balance between giving listeners exactly what they're anticipating and slyly tipping the sound in a new direction. Mixtape highlight ""Genn"" from Purps could easily be mistaken for some forgotten strain of UK dubstep. Anchored by a whirling, creepy organ and ominous synth horns, it seems more leisurely than the rest of the instrumentals. This is a Luger beat that isn't in a rush to unleash the drums-- a beat-drop anticipated by trap-rap fiends much the same way bassheads wait for dubstep's drop-- and it seems just as excited to fill the downtime with stoned-out atmosphere. Is it necessary for Bobby Beats' ""808 One"" to stretch to seven minutes? Probably not, but it's a terrifying march of a beat, and the confidence to let it rattle and pound for this long suggests some kind of strange ambition. But when the rewards of loud, evil rap beats are in the tiniest of details, something is seriously wrong. Had 808 Mafia arrived a year or so ago, perhaps it would have been a bit more mindblowing. The problem is, instrumental hip-hop, thanks to AraabMuzik, Clams Casino, and others, has made 808 Mafia's beat-tape approach seem underwhelming. A fun game for your ears though, is trying to imagine the Lex Luger beat as new again, not pounded into the ground by popular radio. Luger and his peers, minions, and imitators cut trap-rap's mid-2000s Wagnerian synth bangers down to size, removing the grandiosity, replacing it all with an ugly, eardrum-attacking snap and crack, and turning mix shows into an hour-long crunk-punk cacophony. 808 Mafia isn't a game-changing instrumental mixtape, but it is a nice reminder of the vitality of the increasingly limp Lex Luger sound.","The joy of this instrumental mixtape by Lex Luger and fellow Atlanta producer Southside's crew is hearing the Luger sound done by originator-approved copycats.

Go Fly a Kite,Ben Kweller,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b8ea9e61561daa6b38/1:1/w_160/9efaf312.jpeg,2012-02-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16323-go-fly-a-kite/,The Noise Company,"The trouble with being a child prodigy, Ben Kweller's new record suggests, is you might grow old faster than everybody else, too. In 1997, when the Texas singer-songwriter was only 15, The New Yorker chronicled the major-label bidding war for his alternative rock band Radish, en route to an appearance on Late Show With David Letterman, European tours, and a commercially disappointing debut album. By 2002, at only age 20, he was living in Brooklyn and making a modestly successful comeback, with the shaggy yet sweetly melodic pop of solo debut Sha Sha, a charming distillation of influences from Weezer and Ben Folds Five. A Ben Folds Five reunion album is on the way, and Weezer's echoes live on in more recent bands such as Surfer Blood and Yuck, but Go Fly a Kite has remarkably little to say about the present. After Sha Sha, Kweller sanded away some of his endearing idiosyncrasies for 2004's more straightforward On My Way, an approach he took further on 2006's Ben Kweller, before decamping back to Texas and trying his hand at alt-country on 2009's Changing Horses. It's silly to quibble over which is best, though, because it seems like a pretty good bet that any fan's favorite Kweller album is whichever one you heard first. Accordingly, Kweller's latest solo full-length, his first to be independently released-- on his own Noise Company label-- brings it all back home, resulting in a retrenchment that's as understandable as it is frustrating. Kweller's impeccably competent craftsmanship is not in dispute. The Steve Miller-tinged Southern rock of ""Free"" builds toward a bluesy guitar solo exactly where it should, despite being unwilling to deploy an F-bomb, and the Wall of Sound-scaling ""Jealous Girl"" packs in enough references-- 1950s pop, Bruce Springsteen, the Cars, John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy""-- for a Girl Talk meta-mp3 binge. Even in the album's lesser songs, such as piano ballad ""The Rainbow"", country-tinged weeper ""I Miss You"", or tempo-shifting organ rocker ""Justify Me"", evidence of Kweller's 15 years putting songs together professionally is on full display. If pastiche means ""speech in a dead language,"" then Kweller is a fluent practitioner. For an album that includes the guitar chords for every song in its packaging so you can play along at home, however, Go Fly a Kite sure is coy when it comes to memorable hooks or lyrical detail-- particularly when compared to Kweller's past songs ""Wasted and Ready"", ""Lizzy"", or Guster collaboration ""I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today"". On the waltzing piano-popper ""Gossip"", we get portentous guitar arpeggios that recall the Beatles' ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", but little to talk about beyond the observation that gossip is ""gonna get you down."" The Pavement-ragged lurch of ""Time Will Save the Day"" contains the following opaque revelation: ""I went through the fortress, I slept with the mistress/ I read through the Bible, it gave me revival."" Which tells us... something. Kweller never makes a mistake, but he never does anything here risky enough to be considered a mistake, either. The most disappointing aspect of Go Fly a Kite is that it sounds so satisfied, almost smug, in its complacency. At 30, Kweller and I are the same age, and we're both fathers, but I'd rather keep chasing our ever-evolving pop culture and risk looking silly than dig in and try to hold onto my 20-year-old self (who, it must be said, could be a total ignorant asshole sometimes). ""Don't regret anything I ever did,"" Kweller insists in John Lennon double-track on scorching new-wave opener ""Mean to Me"", adding, ""'Cause I always knew where I was coming from."" Well, that makes one of us. ""I've come full circle,"" Kweller futher declares over the CSNY-style folk of ""Full Circle"", which could easily have been the album's title. By jaunty back-porch closer ""You Can Count on Me"", though, it's unclear whether Kweller has learned anything along the way, or whether he's just back where he started from-- without the youthful impulsiveness that made him likable to begin with: ""It's a sad day 'cause all my old friends have changed/ I just want you to know that I'm still the same,"" he promises. Well, fuck that, Kwell-dog. As a much older, forever-young man once sang, ""He not busy being born is busy dying."" An even better title for Go Fly a Kite would've been Get Off My Lawn.","Ben Kweller's latest solo full-length, his first to be independently released, suggests that child prodigies might grow older faster than everybody else, too.

The Narrow Garden,Eyvind Kang,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b69d034d5c69bf4d5e/1:1/w_160/3aabcb21.jpeg,2012-02-23 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16321-the-narrow-garden/,Ipecac,"Eyvind Kang is not the type to repeat himself. To come to grips with the music of the prolific American composer, arranger, and violinist, you would need to sift through upwards of 50 albums, each with its own secret but palpable internal guidelines. (Lots of them have to do with ""NADE,"" a Sanskrit word with a number of obscure connotations that has a mysterious significance for Kang.) And you would have to range far beyond the composer's own works, through those of Laurie Anderson, Sunn O))), Mike Patton, John Zorn, Marc Ribot, Bill Frisell, and many other hard-to-classify artists. To generalize, Kang refracts strategies from global classical, jazz, folk, and experimental music though his esoteric personal interests, which are always changing. He's a musical polymath who writes in his own voice instead of self-consciously ""crossing genres."" Boundaries are aren't smashed, but simply ignored, dreamily melting away. The Narrow Garden features an exotic array of strings, winds, horns, and percussion, performed by an international cast of more than 30 musicians from three different ensembles. Written at home, on an island near Seattle, but partially recorded in Barcelona, the record purports to explore the medieval concept of courtly love. We all know that ""explores the concept of"" often boils down to ""mentions in the liner notes,"" but you don't have to strain too hard to hear Kang's intricate weaving of soft, romantic consonances and harsh, anxious dissonances as an expression of the quicksilver joys and miseries of formalized desire. Taking in lyric poetry, Western choral music, Middle Eastern and South Asian modes, and ""ashugh"" singing (a popular folk tradition heavily associated with the Caucasus), The Narrow Garden features some of the most sunny and flowering music that Kang has created, seamlessly joined with a couple of sinister threnodies. If the Middle East-tinged jazz of Wyatt, Atzmon & Stephen's For the Ghosts Within had been aggressively produced by Svarte Greiner, it might have come out like this. At one extreme, there are ravishing compositions of deceptive simplicity, which accumulate delightful embellishments. These include ""Pure Nothing"" (a sultry setting of a Guilhem IX poem translated into English by W.S. Merwin) and ""Forest Sama'i"", where a serpentine melody seems to hover over Eastern and Western classical modes without alighting on either one; the playful variations unfold until the song abruptly takes flight in a scherzo-like dance animated by trembling whistles. At the other extreme are the title track and ""Usnea"": dense, metallic braids of screeching strings, ear-spearing flutes, and other distressed timbres. Kang knows how to sculpt and compress clashing harmonies until they take on an inviolable collective form, like a perfect cube of mangled cars fresh from a compactor. But the best thing about the record's tonal variety is how neatly it all blends together, especially on epic closer ""Invisus Natalis"", where a fleet of guitars, basses, strings, and bassoons taper down to a liquid cacophony, dissolving all of Kang's thought-provoking musicological contrasts into a flawless, golden glow.","The American composer and violinist's exploration of courtly love features an array of strings, winds, horns, and percussion, performed by an international cast of more than 30 musicians.

"Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads",Dustin Wong,by: B Michael Payne,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ac9d034d5c69bf4d4f/1:1/w_160/39985838.jpeg,2012-02-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16314-dreams-say-view-create-shadow-leads/,Thrill Jockey,"The output of guitarist Dustin Wong has gradually shifted from chaotic to crystalline. His early work with Ecstatic Sunshine veered toward shaggy guitar rock, while Ponytail was like an unhinged version of Deerhoof with odd hooks and wordless vocals. Wong's solo work, though obviously springing from the same headspace, consolidates and unifies his aesthetic. Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads follows 2010's solo debut Infinite Love, a conceptual album based in part on a psychedelic experience. It featured the same material-- repetitive, layered guitar lines and a tiny dose of drum machine-- presented in two similar renditions across two discs. Dreams Say has a similarly out-there origin, with a title inspired in part by his dreams. But the album's actual construction is more compact and solid than its predecessor. Wong has explained his creative process-- the way he uses a guitar and a series of pedals-- in terms of a textile factory. The pedals that change the guitar's tone add texture, delay pedals weave a pattern, a loop pedal replicates the sounds, and an envelope filter colors them. It's a powerful explanatory tool for thinking about Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads, but after receiving piles and piles of such exquisitely crafted sonic fabrics, I'm left with the question of what to do with them. The answer to that challenge is surprisingly broad. On the one hand, it seems as though Wong's music is naturally introspective. It lacks the rock immediacy of Ecstatic Sunshine, and there aren't Ponytail frontwoman Molly Siegel's pre-verbal vocal yelps to divert from all the intricacies. Some songs, such as ""Space Tunnel Graffiti"", sound like basalt blocks being dropped around your head. Alternately, ""Feet Prints on Flower Dreads"" starts with an urgent guitar figure and builds slowly into an industrious, vaguely conventional pop song with chorus-drenched chords and competing lead lines that cut sharply across the audible spectrum. None of the songs are simple, and they mostly all build to surprising and surprisingly weird heights. A twin strength/weakness of these songs is that they generally start discretely, as simple guitar figures onto which Wong piles more loops and lines. The album's strong sense of pacing leads to moments where, as each song crests, you tend to think, This, right here, is the highlight. Then it ends, and the next song starts from point zero. Which is good and bad. ""Toe Tore Oh"", something of a centerpiece, builds slowly and doesn't hit a groove until about four minutes in. Two minutes later, it stops abruptly, and the listener's given a new fabric to examine. In a way, each song's pattern is like an aural Rorschach test. (Wong's textile analogy is apt.) You hear the music, sure, but only the parts your brain latches onto. Even on good headphones, it's difficult to catch everything that's going on. Your mind wanders along one guitar path, and then you realize you've necessarily missed five or six branching paths. That's not a huge knock, though, since the album does reward repeat listens. In fact, it requires them. One go around might emphasize the Motown-style bassline in ""Purple Slipped Right"", and on another you'll notice the ghostly harmonic artifacts popping up among the pizzicato muted string rhythm. Wong uses the loop pedal like a factory machine stamping out parts, and the little imperfections and accidents that get captured and preserved only add to each layer's complexity.","Following 2010's Infinite Love, the onetime Ecstatic Sunshine and Ponytail guitarist offers a complex, well-crafted collection of loops and layers inspired, in part, by dreams.

The Something Rain,Tindersticks,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a3b1335d7bf169a617/1:1/w_160/2ac0c753.jpeg,2012-02-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16307-tindersticks/,Constellation,"It was a mere coincidence that Tindersticks' original lineup dissolved not long after their most faithful students, the National, broke overground with their third album, Alligator. But in retrospect it's hard not to view that moment as a symbolic passing of the torch, akin to proud working-class parents sending their kids off to an Ivy League school in anticipation of future success. While the National's more melodramatic take on Tindersticks' patented pop-noir balladry has landed them in hockey arenas and presidential-campaign videos, Stuart Staples and co. have been defiant in their refusal to follow their disciples' charge into the mainstream. Since signing to Constellation and introducing a revamped lineup with 2008's The Hungry Saw and 2010's Falling Down a Mountain, Tindersticks have gradually drifted away from the string-swept epics that defined their astounding first three albums and the studious soul tones that defined the next three; by loosening up their performances, amplifying their psychedelic side, and projecting a greater degree of playfulness, they've practically become the world's most dignified jam band. While the more freewheeling approach has provided this veteran group with a renewed sense of inspiration by stretching their signature sound into uncharted territory, their first two Constellation efforts didn't yield the sort of cardiac-arresting emotional wallop that's synonymous with the Tindersticks brand. But with The Something Rain, Tindersticks strike the sweet spot between experimental sprawl and hot, bothered soul, and if it doesn't achieve the same weightiness as their 1990s-era name-making triptych, it's fully on the level of their exceptional early-2000s releases Can Our Love... and Waiting for the Moon. Tindersticks have traditionally favored low-key opening tracks to gently lure you into their harrowing headspace, but The Something Rain effects a pronounced break from that logic with ""Chocolate""-- for one, it clocks in at nine minutes, making it the lengthiest track in the band's dense catalog. More significantly, it marks a return to the spoken-word soundtrack format of their 1995 signature ""My Sister"", setting a short-story account of a first date to a molten acid-rock refrain that gradually erupts into a brass-blasted climax that heralds the welcome reintroduction of long-time associate Terry Edwards. And just when you start to question why such a seemingly mundane narrative warrants such an over-the-top presentation, there's a ""gotcha!"" denouement to the story that constitutes the band's most broadly humorous gesture to date. In both tone and form, ""Chocolate"" is by far the most atypical track on The Something Rain, but its audaciousness translates into the fiery performances that follow. Where Tindersticks tend to deploy 1970s soul and R&B signifiers to cut through their albums' prevailing air of despair-- and the cheerful, cha-cha-cha strut of ""Slippin' Shoes"" and the gorgeously languid ballad ""Come Inside"" serve a similar purpose here-- Something Rain standout ""Show Me Everything"" uses its smoky Hammond-organ groove, shots of brass, and female backing singers to coax a masterfully intense vocal turn from Staples, with images of latex-gloved hands pressed against glass that ooze with seedy suggestion. ""This Fire of Autumn"" works a similar trick to equally captivating effect, but at a quickened tempo that turns more anxious with each verse/chorus pass; glockenspiels have rarely been used to such unnerving effect. Where Staples' downcast narratives were the driving force of the band's early works, the retooled Tindersticks' power lies in their skills of arrangement; structurally, these songs don't really change once they begin, but they accrue considerable force through the layering of complementary string/horn patterns and Staples' pushing his perennially bruised croon to heightened levels of desperation. That makes the heady rush of ""Frozen"" all the more amazing-- though the song never breaks out of its skittering, wah-wah-accented rhythm, it still feels completely weightless and disorienting, with Staples' echo-drenched voice contorting in and out of the mix while Edwards' free-flowing horn squawks swoop in like stormy gusts of wind. And each time Staples repeats the line, ""If I could just hold you,"" it starts to sound less like a call to a faraway lover than the predatory intimations of a stalker. It may have taken them two albums to find their proper footing with their new line-up but, with The Something Rain, Tindersticks provide a wholly convincing reminder that they are, by definition, an incendiary device.","On Tindersticks' ninth album, their best with their retooled lineup, the pop-noir balladeers strike the sweet spot between experimental sprawl and sultry soul.

Lilacs & Champagne,Lilacs & Champagne,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39913d197565213a986/1:1/w_160/8f19cf6a.jpeg,2012-02-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16300-lilacs-champagne/,Mexican Summer,"The first seven seconds of Lilacs & Champagne's self-titled album contain an appropriated piece of music so instantly resonant to a particular segment of listenership that it might dictate the way they hear the remainder of the album. It's the short fanfare ITC Entertainment used in its mid-1970s pre-show identification, smothered under enough reverb and crackle to evoke something not entirely dusted off before being spooled up, and if you recognize it at all it's probably from one of two contexts: either the beginning of ""The Muppet Show"" or ""It's a Big Daddy Thing"". Say what you will about pop-music hauntology and its reliance on plucking at our memories, but that kind of cue isn't the entire conversation-- just an attention-getting way to start one. Once Lilacs & Champagne strikes that nerve, it pulls you through one of those experiences unique to sample-based, mostly instrumental music-- reconstructed old sounds built up into a theater of the mind, the soundtrack for a story that exists only in the blanks that listeners fill. Alex Hall and Emil Amos have spent enough time in Grails to have both the desire and the means to translate their ear for psych-inflected desert rock into something a bit different, more indebted to sounds that already exist but still have new juxtapositions in there somewhere. And the album that Hall and Amos put together is as much an evocation of Stones Throw genre-hoarding fadedness as it is of post-Syd, pre-Dark Side Pink Floyd in European-art-film-soundtrack mode. Think of the spookiest bits, intentional or otherwise, of small-press acid rock, library-music ephemera, or trans-continental exotica-- Lilacs & Champagne brings it all to a head. At its simplest, Lilacs & Champagne runs its MPC fodder through a hangar-sized cavern of reverb, a move that gives its musically cinematic allusions the sensation of bringing dark, movie-theater isolation out into the great wide sunlit open.This gives its guitar/percussion interplay a sort of twangy, nerve-rattling airiness, another logical midpoint on the dub/rock continuum that Internal Wrangler tangled with a dozen years back. ""Sensations"" and ""Laid Fucking Back"" in particular have the cast of bleary-eyed, heatstruck codeine rock, Blue Öyster Cult's ""Then Came the Last Days of May"" stretching on into an endless summer. Yet those cuts aren't alone in maintaining an overarching mood of sun-yellowed strangeness, even as they're interspersed with DOOM-ready slabs of grindhouse oddness like ""King of Kings"" and ""Listener X"" that wrangle the stoner-rock lineage into more explicitly hip-hop territory. But above and beyond the memory-blurring allusions to vaguely experienced times and places that come with this kind of stylistic hybrid, the feel of Lilacs & Champagne and its counterculture-exploitation-soundtrack appeal trades on a certain distinct self-awareness of its own evocative potential. It helps that there's an undercurrent of emphasizing what happens when mellow pleasantness, of-the-moment fad-chasing, and feel-good sophisticated kitsch grow unsettling with age. Love-scene string sections and guitars that sound like they could've come from an earnest hippies-for-Jesus folk mass are phased into decaying oblivion. The chipper Quaalude frolic interpolation of ""Anything Goes"" that ""Nice Man"" opens with could be the remnant of some now-irrelevant celebrity's hokey network variety show, but the lo-fi tape wobble that so many wave-gazers filtered their bedroom pop through turns this particular clip into the stuff of The Shining, especially when the skittering horror-movie pianos roll in. And the lounge-crooner refrain of ""Lilacs"" that gives the group and album their name bobs with an almost disembodied shakiness over a bed of synthesizers suited more to stalkers than romantics. It's sort of campy stuff, but it's gripping in its willful oddity, and its synthesis of long-lost psych and longer-lost B-movie mood-setting is dead on. The only way it could be more faithful to that experience would be if you stumbled across it at 3 a.m. while channel-surfing, and spent the next hour wondering if anybody at the station knew something this strange was even being aired. Assuming you weren't dreaming it.","Grails' Alex Hall and Emil Amos have put together a gripping collection of sample-based, mostly-instrumental music: Think of the spookiest bits of small-press acid rock, library-music ephemera, and trans-continental exotica.

Blood for the Master,Goatwhore,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b3ea9e61561daa6b32/1:1/w_160/08933b5b.jpeg,2012-02-22 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16319-blood-for-the-master/,Metal Blade,"If you take the time to read the script of Blood for the Master, the fifth album by New Orleans death metal quartet Goatwhore, you might be intimidated. True to stylistic expectations, these 10 songs are indeed rife with deicide, genocide, apocalypse, upheaval, bloodshed, and biting. The horror-house images are occasionally compelling, too, like the loaded descriptor ""bound in serpent's coil"" or the suggestive ""a drop of blood in water."" During opener ""Collapse in Eternal Worth"", there's talk of perdition and sacrifice, decay and slaughter, extinction and returning ""these false gods to realms of disease."" Elsewhere, heavens burn, virgins bleed, underworlds hunger, massacres gratify, and zombies rise. In a brilliant moment of deadly entendre, the narrator even intends to ""awake the mourning into onyx dawn."" In an age of Mediafire links and nabbed torrents, though, you're rightly asking yourself who even reads death metal lyrics-- or lyrics at all-- really? Why take the time to pore over these 2,500 words concerning demons and death when you could simply let these 38 minutes blast at high volume? Wouldn't that be more fun? Generally, yes, but Blood for the Master is such a tedious listen from a tired band that the lyrics are more entertaining than the sounds behind them. Each of these 10 verbose tracks pummels through three to four minutes of rote, static death metal, racing through the motions with an edict that suggests not the obliteration of humanity or the heavens but instead imagination itself. If reading lyrics is boring, hearing these is a step worse. Musically, Blood for the Master is bland enough to make mid-song trade-offs between singer Louis Falgoust's serrated sneer and Sammy Duet's deeper bellow newsworthy, because it pretty much encapsulates the extent of any given song's dynamic. When the two briefly shout together during ""When Steel and Bone Meet"", it's a cause for care that passes as quickly as it happens. And when the second side opens with a spiraling web of acoustic and electric guitars played by producer Erik Rutan, there's an instant when you might even believe Blood for the Master can save itself. It returns immediately, however, into its own morass of circumscription. It wasn't always this way for Goatwhore: Though they've never been a great band during their 15-year tenure, they've occasionally been interesting or, at the very least, promising. In 2006, A Haunting Curse trussed touches of their homeland's scuzz to the death metal tide, while traces of sprinting grindcore and mid-tempo Motörhead added depth. Nearly three years later, Goatwhore pulled the reins for Carving Out the Eyes of God, excising some of those excess strains while still allowing for enough black metal rushes and tempo twists for some measure of unpredictability. But Blood for the Master is completely codified so that little but the basics-- a lot of thrash, a load of weak solos, a pair of vocalists who mirror more than complement each other-- survive. Goatwhore offer a glimpse of black metal at the start of ""Beyond the Spell of Discontent"" before returning headlong into their own orthodoxy; on ""In Deathless Tradition"", they at least nod to a different tempo, sinking into sludge beneath Cookie Monster imprecations. Pretty much everywhere else, though, Goatwhore stand boldly for the boilerplate, or sounds that have been captured with more enthusiasm and adventure countless times before. For a band that's lyrically so devoted to upsetting the order, Goatwhore sound unequivocally content with replaying the past. ""Praise the order of chaos,"" Falgoust barks at one point, just above the endless din of his ostensibly sanctimonious revivalists. Well, OK, but you first.","The New Orleans death-metal quartet's fifth album is filled with songs about deicide, genocide, apocalypse, upheaval, bloodshed, and biting.

Maraqopa,Damien Jurado,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b25e6ef959693224be/1:1/w_160/00f4d241.jpeg,2012-02-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16318-maraqopa/,Secretly Canadian,"Maybe 13 really is a lucky number. That's the number of years into Seattle singer/songwriter Damien Jurado's career that he linked up with production extraordinaire Richard Swift for the former's 2010 LP, Saint Bartlett. The album saw the former painting his works with broader brushstrokes and an expanded palette of colors, exercising an accessibility that made the album stand out like a gloriously sore thumb in a catalog of Pacific Northwest folk rock that, for most of the previous decade, had only registered with the closest-watching of observers. As much credit as Jurado obviously deserved for making the leap from ""good"" to ""great,"" though, it's inarguable that teaming up with Swift, whose reputation as a studio collaborator grows with every release, was Jurado's most inspired choice during Saint Bartlett's genesis. The echoed claps of the swooning opener ""Cloudy Shoes"" sounded like the remaining pieces of a puzzle, hidden for way too long, had been found and snapped into place. Soulmates are hard to come by, and Damien Jurado definitely agrees. For his latest album, Maraqopa, he reunited with Swift in the latter's National Freedom studio in Oregon, the pair sharing performing duties. The results are kind of a sequel to Saint Bartlett: Like its predecessor, Maraqopa is largely varied in sonic mood, changing its tone song-to-song to include soft-psych freak-outs, rainy folk, haunted 1960's pop, and slow-burning oddball sparseness. That might sound like an unfocused mess on paper, but this collection's success lies in Swift and Jurado's restless experimentation. You can almost feel the heat off of the pair's kinetic synapses, as it radiates off every unspooling guitar line on the stormy opener ""Nothing Is the News"", or the gorgeous warbling that lies under ""Working Titles"". Press materials for Maraqopa have pointed out that the title references a fictional, far-away place, going as far to subtly suggest that the record is a loosely drawn concept album. I'm not buying it-- partially because Jurado can't help but evoke the very real section of the United States he resides in, from the title of ""So On, Nevada"" to the Washington references in ""Working Titles""-- but that's not to suggest that Maraqopa is lacking in concept. Jurado recently mentioned on Twitter that he drew inspiration from The End Is at Hand, a double-zip homemade compilation from California blog Aquarium Drunkard that rounded up obscure 1960s/1970s psychedelic folk and guitar music attached to the Jesus People's Movement. Maraqopa's first half is, indeed, cloaked in the long shadow of religion, with references to ""golden crowns,"" stars aligning, and the spookiness of faith (and, at times, lack thereof). The spectre of belief literally haunts a few of these songs; ""Life Away From the Garden"" elicits chills via organ stabs and faded, childlike call-and-response backup singing, as Jurado exercises his sneaky lyrical talents with double-meaning (""There was a time/ When we were golden/ Like the sun/ We were lights in the world""). By the time the spooky, deeply felt weirdness of the invisible-fame non-fantasy ""Reel to Reel"" arrives, Jurado's belief-fixated eye has shifted from the intangible to the tangible, underlining a motive that's run throughout his career: always ask questions, whether you're staring at the sky, down below, or the people around you on solid ground. Maraqopa feels less revelatory than Saint Bartlett on pure impact; while the latter was a fine balance of chewy folk-pop delicacies and the basement-borne shadowy expressions that Jurado's built his fanbase on, this album is more of a mood piece, its melodic rewards teased out over time and drenched in the type of steady rain that his home state is known for. So, it's the second-best album of his career, then-- which is nothing to sneeze at, really. Maraqopa marks 15 years since Jurado's debut album, the Sub Pop-released Waters Ave S, and yet this fruitful renaissance has seemingly just begun, injecting new life into an artist who had less been written off than he'd been lost to the hype-obsessed, new-new-new sands of time. Whether the destinations be real or fictional, it'll be a real treat to watch where Jurado-- hopefully with Swift in tow-- will end up next.","The Seattle singer/songwriter reunited with Saint Bartlett producer Richard Swift for his 10th studio album.

Concerning the Entrance Into Eternity,Jim Jarmusch,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a29d034d5c69bf4d3c/1:1/w_160/bd23cac0.jpeg,2012-02-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16306-concerning-the-entrance-into-eternity/,Important,"Jozef Van Wissem's self-proclaimed ""liberation of the lute"" has always been a process of inversion. In fact, the songs on his very first release, 2000's Retrograde Renaissance Lute (A Classical Deconstruction), are literally inverted. He took traditional lute tablatures and rewrote them upside-down, then cut up and rearranged the results to form new compositions. Since then, Van Wissem has continued to invert his baroque instrument in order to be, as he told us earlier this month, ""a lute player with a punk rock attitude."" He's written musical palindromes (melodies which sound the same played forwards or backwards), delved into experimental techniques like field recordings and improvisation, and collaborated with modern-styled string players such as James Blackshaw and Tetuzi Akiyama. Those players dip into classical styles themselves too, but the musical mindset of Van Wissem's latest collaborator, Jim Jarmusch, was formed in the punk-drenched milieu of late-1970's New York. There the now-famous indie film director played keyboards and sang with the no-wave band the Del Byzanteens and shot no-wave films starring musicians like John Lurie and Richard Edson. Which makes the pair's debut album the first full release Van Wissem has made with an actual punk rocker. (Jarmusch added guitar to one track on Van Wissem's 2011 solo album, The Joy That Never Ends). Such a meeting of divergent backgrounds could result in a kind of tonal car crash, but Jarmusch easily and compellingly weaves his playing into Van Wissem's era-bridging craft. At times their sounds connect like rhyming lines of poetry; in other places, like opener ""Apokatastasis (Restoration)"", Jarmusch's long tones form the echo of Van Wissem's patient, precise notes. In a few instances, such as when Jarmusch plays acoustic guitar, it can even be tough to tell these twin souls apart. That complementary vibe is due in large part to Van Wissem's simple, sparse melodies, which leave lots of room for Jarmusch to enter and move around in. Concerning the Entrance has its moments of contrast and tension, too. On ""The Sun of the Natural World Is Pure Fire"", the way Jarmusch grinds out caustic noise behind Van Wissem's exploratory plucks produces a mesmerizing dissonance. Later, on closer ""He Is Hanging By His Shiny Arms, His Heart an Open Wound With Love"", he interrupts Van Wissem's solo playing by reciting St. John of the Cross' poetry with a cool, detached tone, sounding oddly like Thurston Moore at 16 rpm. Still, the best moments come when Van Wissem and Jarmusch share a single musical mind. The most blending comes during the album's middle track, ""Continuation of the Last Judgement"". As Van Wissem devoutly spins out a lute loop, Jarmusch adds small accents, then slides into electric guitar waves that slyly bend around Van Wissem's cycles. Here, the duo's capacity to find interlocking patterns feels infinite, making ""Continuation"" the best possible title. You can imagine these comrades spinning their wordless yarns long after the album ends.","Jozef Van Wissem, the self-professed ""lute player with a punk rock attitude,"" offers a collaborative LP with the film director (and guitarist) Jim Jarmusch.

Mr. M,Lambchop,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b332ea9e61561daa6a55/1:1/w_160/6a3a8164.jpeg,2012-02-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16221-lambchop-mr-m/,MergeCity Slang,"For the first 20 seconds of Mr. M, all the listener will hear is the sound of a string section, gliding, pretty, and warm, like something from an old Disney movie. The strings are followed by brushed, rolling snare drums. Soon, Kurt Wagner, the band's singer, stumbles into the mix. ""Don't know what the fuck they talk about,"" he sings. His voice sounds beery and disoriented. It seems possible that he's in the wrong room. Coming from some singers, the line might sound like a challenge, but coming from Wagner, it's a simple admission. Lambchop is a band that has spent the past 20 years in Nashville building its own idiosyncratic universe. For better and worse, the current state of music, its trends and its innovations, pass them by completely. Even during the days when alt-country seemed like a viable art form, Wagner's ornery sense of humor-- the kind that drives you to cap your album with a 40-second-long song called ""I Sucked My Boss' Dick""-- made them seem totally out-of-step with their supposed contemporaries. In a lot of ways, Lambchop is a band that seems committed to its own irrelevance. Irrelevance, though, isn't a burden for Lambchop as much as it is a jumping off point for what makes them them. ""I see your Pitchfork I-rock saviors,"" goes one line on 2006's Damaged-- ""I'm sorry, I still prefer Jim Nabors."" If you aren't sure who Jim Nabors is and you're still reading our reviews about I-rock saviors, you've unknowingly participated in Wagner's self-definition: He hears the conversation going on but damn if he'll take part in it. Nothing on Mr. M is designed to pop, not in the conventional sense of the word. To describe the band's current style is to invoke genres with an almost negative cultural cachet: lounge, 1970s country, Burt Bacharach-- styles so fixated on sounding high-class that they run the risk of feeling trashy. On paper, Lambchop is a band that would appeal primarily to grandparents and drunks. Wagner's voice is a low, wounded-sounding instrument whose character has only deepened with time (though Wagner, in his self-effacing Wagnerian way, has attributed it to cigarettes). At root, he's a crooner, but his croon sounds alternately fragile and gruff-- the elderly neighbor who returns your lost dog one day and commands you to step off his azaleas the next, spittle hanging from his lip. His lyrics are a mix of minor, concrete observations and poetic flights. ""We have crawled among the elements, taking pictures of our phones"" is one. ""Sleep makes you possible"" is another. His writing has the power to transform the everyday into a mystery, but his voice-- and the music behind it-- attempts to transform the mystery into something unplugged and emotionally direct-- to make ""The wine tasted like sunshine in a basement"" sound a little bit like ""I love you."" If Lambchop's music bears some essential ambition, it's to marry ambivalence and sentimentality. My favorite turn on Mr. M is on ""Buttons"", a portrait of a small-town loser by a narrator who seems to neither love nor hate the man he sings about. ""Been better times for those that are in trouble,"" Wagner sings, ""and maybe there'll be better times for you. The weight you've gained has made your head a bubble, and your button eyes are brown and not her-- black and blue."" On the last words-- ""black and blue""-- Wagner's voice warps into an almost grotesque croon, like he's either about to giggle or weep over the string section, and yet the image in my head is of a pudgy, small-town loser and the woman who he may or may not have beaten with his own sad fists. What we are supposed to do with these mixed emotional cues, I have no idea. It's to Lambchop's credit that their music avoids comfortable resolutions. Instead, it hangs there, no moral, no judgment. Apprehending Mr. M does not take a genius, nor does it take an English degree, nor does it take 180-gram vinyl and an $800 Scandanavian turntable with counterweights made out of rare geodes. What it does take, I think, is patience. I like tarted-up, throat-grabbing music as much as the next frantically inattentive twentysomething. I also find a deep satisfaction in Lambchop's subtlety, which never makes the mistake of thinking that being high-minded or instructive will get us over to their weird team. Nobody, not even the most depraved among us, needs to be slapped on the wrist in order to see beauty. And still, despite Wagner's protests that he doesn't know what the fuck they talk about, Mr. M sounds aware of itself as an argument-- an argument for the kind of patience the music on it demands. And so we return to this idea of Lambchop's irrelevance. For the purpose of barroom reductions, Mr. M sounds like a bunch of guys tapping delicately on acoustic instruments from deep within a mausoleum, or the sound of wind blowing gently through the pages of an open book resting on a front-porch rocking chair. But how rare is it that a band asks you to listen to so little, and how much rarer is it that they make it sound like so much?","Kurt Wagner and co.'s masterful 11th album is one of the best to emerge from their strange, modest universe.

Meltdown,Mind Spiders,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b376b1335d7bf169a5cb/1:1/w_160/87200954.jpeg,2012-02-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16272-mind-spiders-meltdown/,Dirtnap,"Denton, Texas, punk mainstay Mark Ryan (Marked Men, High Tension Wires) didn't intend to take Mind Spiders out of the studio. He recorded the self-titled debut-- a collection of lo-fi garage, glam, punk, darkwave, and rock'n'roll-- largely by himself out of boredom during the Marked Men's hiatus. When people showed interest, he found it strange. Then, when he started getting requests to play some Mind Spiders festival sets, he did what Cloud Nothings and Wavves did before him: put together a band that would later accompany him in the studio. But while Dylan Baldi had three guys on Attack on Memory and Nathan Williams brought two along for King of the Beach, Ryan wrangled a veritable murderer's row of Texas garage staples for Meltdown: an additional guitarist (Stephen Svacina of Uptown Bums), a bassist (Daniel Fried of Bad Sports and Wax Museums), an organist (Peter Salisbury of Stumptone), and two drummers who play at the same time (Mike Throneberry of the Marked Men and Gregory Rutherford of High Tension Wires). Talk about everything being bigger in Texas. But the mob effect is well-placed on Meltdown, where most of the songs have enormous hooks and use the extra hands for a fuller, more powerful soundscape. The loud-quiet-loud ""Play You Out"", for example, utilizes the extra guitar well-- during the softer moments, one churns the rhythm while the other adds tinges of harmony. When it picks up speed, the extra guitar amplifies the volume, naturally, but also adds another palpable layer of power. As for the second drum set, you have to listen carefully for it-- the occasional fill or cymbal crash will hang over the album's continuous drive-- but the extra kit seems to strengthen each song's percussive backbone. That said, it's not entirely necessary to have all the extra men in the studio-- the supplementary cymbals that follow the soaring opening riff of ""Beat"" could easily be added in post. But it's an album of robust garage-punk fare, and part of the appeal is that it'll sound just as sturdy and huge live. The majority of that energy and volume is stacked right at the front of the album, the A-side brimming with anthemic riffs. It's hard to take opener ""You Are Dead"", a near perfect bit of chugging, under-two-minute power pop, off repeat. Ironically, that opening song also points to one of the biggest potential pitfalls for Ryan: Several tracks on Meltdown hold a not-so-subtle resemblance to Jay Reatard. The hooks, melodies, and even Ryan's voice are eerily similar. See ""More Than You"", which has an organ-led balladry format reminiscent of ""I'm Watching You"". That's not to say Ryan copped Jay's style so much as the two men ran in similar circles and have always had like-minded sensibilities when it comes to songwriting. (See most of Marked Men's recorded output.) And really, it's hard to complain when the songs are as exciting and over-the-top as they are at the front of Meltdown. For the first Mind Spiders album, Ryan didn't put too much emphasis on organization-- he jumped through different genres and styles. By contrast, Meltdown is organized with a loose sonic narrative. Synths start infiltrating the B-side, which works for the most part, but by the final track, ""Meltdown"", the live band is chucked out and replaced by a lengthy, unmoving, useless synth jam. And maybe that's the concept here-- that the album gradually ""melts down"" into Computer World-lite. After so much muscle, it's a disappointing finish (especially since it's placed directly after potential perfect album closer, ""Wait For Us""). That sci-fi instinct to melt rock'n'roll into synths is at least, thematically, a good fit for Ryan. He named the band after Fritz Leiber's 1961 sci-fi collection The Mind Spider and Other Stories, and he's said that he loves Brian Eno. On Mind Spiders, he communicated those interests by including the word ""spider"" in nearly every song for an ""old sci-fi movie plot"" effect. That seeps into Meltdown on several songs, like ""Upside Down"" (""the spiders are all around"") and ""More Than You"" (""When my head starts to crack/ And the spiders attack""). According to Ryan, it's not symbolic of any deeper meaning; instead, it's an attempt to appropriate sci-fi for rock'n'roll fun, as the Ramones co-opted horror movie imagery for ""Pinhead"" and ""Chain Saw"". And, until that last song, fun persists in the album's absurdly infectious hooks without being marred by concepts or meaning.","After a lo-fi debut he recorded largely by himself, Denton punk mainstay Mark Ryan (Marked Men, High Tension Wires) has assembled a mob of Texas garage staples to assist him with this robust followup.

Dub the World! Actually Remixed,La Big Vic,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a79d034d5c69bf4d46/1:1/w_160/41937f84.jpeg,2012-02-21 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16310-dub-the-world-actually-remixed/,Underwater Peoples,"The law of diminishing returns is exceedingly relevant when it comes to remix albums. Generally, the practice is to take an album that was already good, put its songs in the hands of other artists, and cross your fingers in hopes that they'll turn in something interesting. Then, they give it to the label, pick the best (and/or catchiest) songs, and repeat the album release cycle with minimal legwork. At best, you'll have an interesting collection of tunes, one that does things the artist would have probably never tried. At worst, the whole process will be every bit as cynical as it sounds. In rare cases, you'll end up with an album that can hold its own against your best material. That said, the idea of a band reinterpreting its own work, in spite of its also being a crapshoot, rarely ceases to be a fascinating venture. Even if it manages to be a drudge of a listen, minimal to the point of being skeletal, or simply a mess, there's always the thought process-- whether a clear musical narrative, an exploration into uncharted territory, or simply an attempt to improve the original-- that serves as a conceptual anchor. For a band as wildly cosmopolitan as Brooklyn's La Big Vic, a trio that includes Pitchfork contributor Emilie Friedlander, it serves as a chance to recontextualize itself without dulling its sonic expansiveness. In fact, the group's sound houses so many components that paring them down and using a clear focal point yields some tremendous results. As a lot of Actually was built on the improvisational instincts of the band, it's no surprise that the dub plates used here are simply a foundation for them to mess with the (already loose) structure of the originals, to venture off into even more far-out territory. Fragments of the original songs are chopped, blurred, and stretched to fit their new grooves, while new harmonies, instruments, and even looped snatches of digital ephemera from other songs (and what sounds like a retro radio commercial) are woven into the whole. ""Mr. Broken Bird Dub"" dulls the propulsive bounce of its source song into something of an anticlimax when filtered into dub-- the opposite effect of the original-- but most of the tracks do a fine job of adjusting. La Big Vic's proclivity for improvisation is best exemplified on ""LYNY Dub"" and opener ""Everybody Needs Jah (FAO Dub)"", where they take the most recognizable melodies of their originals and fuse them with a host of elements: pedal-treated synths, exploratory guitar work, even a section of uncut dialogue from Friedlander, trying to make heads or tails of a freshly recorded take. The concentration required to seamlessly merge as many styles as they do is the calling card of La Big Vic, but just as important is their innate ability to go off-script, creating a sound as natural, imperfect, and human as it is out of this world. When you think about it-- as far-flung as their members are, as many world-music elements are subtly used in their music-- La Big Vic making a dub album isn't very far out of the realm of possibility. Dub is essentially a platform for experimental artists to utilize their most improvisational techniques and couple them with a strong (but not unbendable) rhythmic anchor. Actually was an album that achieved these goals by throwing out the rule book. It's not surprising then that a remix album that sets a clear template, while allowing the band to explore the outer recesses of its sound, is every bit as vital as the work from which it was derived.","Wildly cosmopolitan Brooklyn trio La Big Vic's dub reinterpretation of its 2011 debut serves as a chance for the band to recontextualize itself without dulling its sonic expansiveness.

After Hours,Nick CatchdubsJackie Chain,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3af5e6ef959693224bb/1:1/w_160/e0ffae3c.jpeg,2012-02-21 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16316-jackie-chain-after-hours/,Fool’s Gold,"The Huntsville, Alabama, MC Jackie Chain first surfaced on the national radar thanks to an odd single titled ""Rollin'"". It's become something of a minor cult classic; with a Gucci-sampling hook and a beat that is basically just a loop of Robert Miles' trance song ""Children"", ""Rollin'"" still doesn't sound like any other dance music/hip-hop blend, because its goal was not to operate as functional dance music in any capacity. Compared with the four-on-the-floor Guetta sound common today, Block Beattaz had laced Jackie with a track that emulated ecstasy's emotional rush while leaving the dancing to someone else. Jackie's latest tape with DJ Nick Catchdubs, After Hours, follows a similar formula. Despite the frequent references to club sounds new and old, the tape is closer in function to the Beatnuts' brand of ignorant party-rap than to Pitbull or Flo Rida. Instead of sampling the dance music of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, though, this music draws on sample sources that rose in the wake of the rave. What helps make this release work is that it studiously avoids being just a club record; it simply references club records. ""Moving"" runs off of a sample that was everywhere the past few years; Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" was transformed into trance by Avicii, which was in turn remixed by Skrillex and played everywhere; shortly afterward, Flo Rida borrowed the same vocal sample. But Jackie's version actually uses Pretty Lights ""Finally Moving"", which is primarily lounge-esque trip-hop, not functional club music. To keep this interesting, it helps that Catchdubs has given him a wealth of clever and unexpected reference points; there are obvious novelty club samples from Scatman John's ""I'm a Scatman"". The album's climax is ""Molly"", an ode to the ubiquitous ecstasy pill with a euphoric saxophone sample swiped directly from Guido's ""Mad Sax"". There are exceptions, but-- thanks in part to Catchdubs' excellent work sequencing the record-- they end up feeling like a part of the overall ebb and flow. It's doubtful that DJ Burn One-- a largely traditionalist ""southern rap tunes"" advocate-- planned that his ""Don't Violate"" production would provoke the overwhelming nausea of a bad trip, but that's effectively its role on the tape. One of the things that keeps the record relentlessly entertaining, of course, is Jackie Chain himself. He's a completely one-dimensional personality, which is perfect; it's a performance of party-rap ignorance with few peers, and his distinctive, shouted, caps-lock flow is the perfect blunt object to effectively convey raw ego. Not that the record is one-note; it manages to capture a wide range of variations on the partying theme. It's just that Jackie's role is to be the same consistent hardhead throughout. His character has no flaws or vulnerabilities; he's simply a partying everyman, his only motivations drugs, booze, money, and women. No one likes thinking about the consequences of stupid behavior, and that's exactly what Jackie Chain is offering: consequence-free hedonism in exactly the right setting.","Drawing on sample sources that rose in the wake of rave, the distinctive Huntsville, Alabama party-rap MC's mixtape with DJ Nick Catchdubs studiously avoids being simply a club record.

Generators,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ad9d034d5c69bf4d51/1:1/w_160/98c867a1.jpeg,2012-02-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16315-generator/,Editions Mego,"Since moving away from his splatter-break Hrvatski alias roughly a decade ago, Keith Fullerton Whitman has spent many albums and EPs winding his way through the long history of electronic music. Where he once found inspiration in the fast-changing and endlessly malleable world of laptop computers and customized Max/MSP patches, he eventually made a deliberate shift to explore the more limited possibilities of earlier technology. Electronic music was once the domain of academics and researchers with access to vast rooms filled with pulsing tubes and clusters of snaking cables. Only those with a commission were allowed anywhere near the machinery. Whitman has spent much of the last decade revisiting the approach and technology of those days and finding ways to personalize and update those tools, bringing the worlds of analog and digital together in a series of lower-key albums and EPs. Whitman has an uncanny knack for taking the analog soundmakers and ring modulators of yore and applying his precise and detailed theoretical constructs to something that sounds, above all, musical. Pieces build and shift and go to unexpected places; textures feel grounded in a tradition but also open and exploratory. These characteristic virtues are here on his new album. ""Generator"" is a piece that Whitman premiered in 2009 and performed in different variations over the next couple of years. These two versions of the piece, very different in tone but with some overlap in terms of musical elements, were recorded at separate shows in September 2010. There's a tiny detail in the early going of ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"", recorded at a show paying tribute to the French electronic music pioneer, that lets us know we're in for something special. As a sine wave hum in the 100 Hz range fades in, we can hear someone coughing and weight being shifted on chairs. This is, in other words, a recording of live electronic music that was made by positioning microphones in a space rather than taking the feed from the sound board. That it's a recording of sound in a room rather than just an electrical signal is important; Whitman's M.O. is to explore the emotional possibilities at the intersection of disparate technologies and histories-- where digital meets analog, ""live"" meets studio, old meets new. And on these two tracks, we're hearing the results of these experiments in an approximation of how they sounded to those in attendance, imperfect rooms with their own resonances and people with respiratory issues and squeaking chairs. After that opening drone, ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"" shifts to a piece of classically pulsing minimalism, the rich tones of Whitman's synth rig spilling out notes and scales and rhythm. Sometimes the movement of the piece takes on an almost baroque air, echoing the mathematical perfection of Bach in the way phrases are proposed and resolved, and it is tuneful and melodic even as the structure is hard to apprehend, lingering just out of reach. It feels weirdly short even at 17 minutes, as its constantly shifting patterns and harmonic combination hint at a piece that could conceivably be endless. While ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"" is gorgeous and endlessly replayable, ""High Zero Generator"" veers further in the direction of experiment. Its first nine minutes are all crackle, bleep, static, and whirr, a lengthy excursion into the realm of pure texture. While the sound of the pinging tones and groaning springs have their own sort of magic, the piece's first half winds up feeling like a long build-up to the sequenced notes of its second, which uses textures and a compositional arc similar to the first piece. While ""Issue Generator"" is rich and full, ""High Zero Generator"" feels pinched and claustrophobic, as if fat synth tones were being shoved into a small hole and frayed into pieces. Together, the ""Generator"" pieces form a terrifically engaging contrast, a fascinating 35 minutes of electronic music that, while drawing heavily from the past, also sounds like nothing else out there now.","Two versions of the Massachusetts electronic composer's 2009 piece ""Generator"", recorded live at separate shows in September 2010, form a terrifically fascinating contrast.

Interstellar,Frankie Rose,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39fb1335d7bf169a611/1:1/w_160/2ac068b1.jpeg,2012-02-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16304-frankie-rose-interstellar/,Slumberland,"Frankie Rose spent a few years kicking around the Brooklyn jangle-pop scene before striking out on her own: As the most charismatic member of Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, and Dum Dum Girls, she was a reliable bolt of onstage electricity enlivening the often noncommittal presences around her. It was pretty clear, even then, that she was eventually destined for bigger things, but her first solo record, recorded under the name Frankie Rose and the Outs, still felt constrained by a reflexive sort of cool-kid slouch. Between that record and Interstellar, she has dropped the pretense of a backing band entirely, and is recording simply as ""Frankie Rose."" The implicit point is clear: This time around, she's going for it. The first moments of ""Interstellar"" make this point immediately. The song opens on a cool-blue vista of synthesizers, a transportingly vast sound of the sort Frankie's never made before. When her voice enters the mix, cooing about interstellar highways and moon dust, it's piped from above, passed through a series of filters so until she slightly resembles the Laurie Anderson of ""O Superman"". A minute in, a massive, Valhalla-pound drum hit resounds, the synths explode sideways, and Frankie hurls us down a flume ride of descending vocal harmonies. It's the most colorful, thrilling music of her career, and as grand a pronouncement as one can make that we're not doing things the same way anymore. Interstellar is a big, second-album leap of faith into deeper waters, a sparkling synth-pop record that wants very badly to mean something to dreamy, hyper-emotional twentysomethings. For her model, she's taken the impression of some of the dreamiest, most hyper-emotional records of her youth. The production on Interstellar is gorgeous, and clearly modeled on the Cure's big, panoramic pop records, like Disintegration: booming-canyon drums, acres of spannable horizon. The drum beat that opens up ""Know Me"" is virtually identical to that of ""Close to Me"", and the silvery guitar leads on ""Gospel/Grace"" are pretty much mimeographed from ""Plainsong"". But although Rose indulges pretty heavily in the Cure's primary colors, she paints something distinctly her own with them. The world of Interstellar is a vision of paradise as lifted from the front of a Trapper Keeper: air-brushed, pastel-hued, and gloriously vivid. Interstellar is not a thematically rich experience-- it basically has one single invitation, and that is to swim with Frankie in the glorious bath of echoes she's drawn for herself. ""All that I want is a pair of wings to fly/ Into the blue, a wide open sky/ Show me your scars, I'll show you mine/ Perched out of the city on a pair of power lines,"" she sings over and over on ""Pair of Wings"", and you can hear this yearning for escape echoed in the record's every upward-spiralling note. Her singing has always been breathy and modest, but on Interstellar, her voice seems to mist on contact, even when she's swirling herself into a prismatic mini-choir of Frankies. On her record, she's just another celestial body orbiting larger ones. The resulting album isn't one you actively explore so much as bask in gratefully. The longer I spend immersed in it, the more I appreciate its details: the haunting, truncated piano chords that the melody of ""Apples for the Sun"" clumps around, or the way Frankie's voice melts into and becomes one with the bloom of synthesized strings in the last minute of ""Gospel/Grace"". Rose is tapping the same slightly shameless clear eyes/full hearts well of teen melodrama that sourced M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, and she demonstrates the same kind of focus and vision in carrying it off. On Interstellar, she transports us further and takes us higher than she ever could have as the drummer of an indie pop revivalist band. Amen to breaking free of sonic restrictions when they outlive their usefulness.","While kicking around the jangle-pop scene, Frankie Rose was a member of Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, and Dum Dum Girls.

I Am Gemini,Cursive,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38a5e6ef95969322490/1:1/w_160/5178b618.jpeg,2012-02-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16291-i-am-gemini/,Saddle Creek,"Credit where due: I Am Gemini is Cursive's weakest record by a disheartening margin, but its lyrics sheet sets a remarkably high standard for anti-piracy measures. I'm sorry, lyric sheet is something of a misnomer, this is a full-on libretto. Knowing the concept behind I Am Gemini is the easy part-- by now, you should know that every Cursive record is organized by some conceptual framework, and Tim Kasher has been more than happy to do the heavy lifting for us. Here, it's ""twin brothers separated at birth, one good and one evil, their unexpected reunion in a house that is not a home ignites a classic struggle for the soul."" Got all that? Now just try to imagine some misguided fool who downloaded this without the 13-page booklet laying out all the characters (which include twin sisters conjoined at the head), indicating ""stage direction,"" and generally letting you know what the hell is going on. But if that sounds a little too Mars Volta for comfort, there's good reason. Kasher similarly leaves you impressed by his dedication to this project even as you have no way to meaningfully interact with it. And that inability to connect is troubling. Because even while Cursive's Domestica and The Ugly Organ remain some of the most purposefully narcissistic albums to ever bear the emo tag, their lyrical acts of emotional martyrdom understandably inspired an intense cult. The feelings behind ""The Recluse"" and ""The Night I Lost the Will to Fight"" aren't exactly healthy, but they're human and worthy of being expressed where they could be related to rather than projected outwards. But lest you think Kasher was simply a breakup opportunist, the Good Life's Album of the Year proved he could make a compelling, fictional couples record. And though uneven, Happy Hollow and Mama, I'm Swollen had plenty of expressive moments where Kasher got outside of himself in order to make the same withering points about religion and consumerism as he did about relationships. But here, Kasher's intent is less clear. Is it some sort of morality play, a grotesquerie exposing greed, ambition, and exploitation? You get some clues in songs that hint at underlying substance abuse, sibling rivalry, and schizophrenia, but the themes are cruelly underdeveloped, hinting at a prequel Kasher forgot to inform us about. If you zoom out far enough, you can ascertain the major plot points easily enough, and Kasher pads things out with references to homemade elixirs, amateur surgery, avian metaphors, Greek mythology, the book of Genesis, Frankenstein, and Freaks. But none of it's in service of establishing any sort of wider resonance or universality of the story, instead just spiking the punch with false potency as cadences bulge with overripe penmanship. Conceptual tomfoolery aside, the music aligns with Kasher's increasing tendency to sand off the edges of his prickly attitude and serrated vocals, and I Am Gemini is by far Cursive's most playful record and almost fun at points. But it isn't necessarily catchier than their previous work, lacking the abrasion and unnerving over-sharing. Cursive were never the place to go for hooks, so how are Kasher's strengths transferrable? While Gemini gets off to an auspicious start with ""This House Alive"" and the new wave-ish ""The Sun and Moon"", unlike the ""singles"" from a similarly linear record like the Streets' A Grand Don't Come For Free, they're all but meaningless as vignettes. And soon thereafter, Gemini loses itself in its plot turns with an undifferentiated mash of rambling, almost randomly pitched vocal melodies, goofy keyboards, buzzing riffs, sarcastic harmonies, and a mocking delivery that sees its subject material as beneath him. At one point on ""Wowowow"", Kasher sings in puns taken from Cursive titles, and this kind of meta exercise makes a sad kind of sense within the context of I Am Gemini's impenetrability. After all, main characters like Cassius, Pollock, Young Cassius, Young Pollock, and the Narrator are all voiced by the same guy the same exact way, a more concrete way of essentially pointing out that the whole of I Am Gemini is Kasher talking to himself.","The latest convoluted concept album from Cursive is based on ""twin brothers separated at birth"" and ""a classic struggle for the soul,"" but the real struggle is trying to make it all the way through.

Misery Wizard,Pilgrim,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a013d197565213a990/1:1/w_160/38305d4f.jpeg,2012-02-20 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16305-misery-wizard/,Metal BladePoison Tongue,"Last year the two headiest stories in heavy metal keyed largely on transgression: There was Liturgy, of course, the Ivy League Brooklyn boys in tattered jeans and baggy t-shirts. They mixed black metal with math-rock and ecstatic classicism while writing a manifesto, making electronic music, and quoting David Tibet. Some people didn't like their attitude. And then there was Lulu, a collaboration between five very rich men who were so important to so many people in so many different contexts that culture critic Chuck Klosterman deigned to, once again, write about heavy music-- for a website bankrolled by ESPN, no less. Both of these scenarios included, for better and worse, someone crossing into new territory and subsequently raising either hackles or heckles. But every battle doesn't have to be won or lost on a bleeding edge, an axiom that the young and enthusiastic doom metal trio Pilgrim keeps sacred. There's nothing shocking or even provocative to report about these three, except maybe that their noms de guerre are incredible: the Wizard sings and plays guitar; Krolg Splinterfest, Slayer of Man slays his drums; and Count Elric the Soothsayer thumbs the bass. Otherwise, the news is that their debut album, Misery Wizard, is an extraordinarily enjoyable if stylistically ordinary entrée into a field that's spawned dozens of offshoots and hybrids during the last four decades. The primary influences here are as obvious as they are legion-- Black Sabbath, Cathedral, Candlemass, Sleep, Saint Vitus, and Electric Wizard, just to shake the ashes off the tip of the old joint. But in a realm where the old-school and the experimental push against one another in an eternally dynamic non-equilibrium, it's certainly not about who your influences are. It's, of course, about how you use them. Pilgrim simply have fun with these predecessors, renewing old sounds with the zeal of teenage boys worshipping cheap Sabbath posters on their bedroom walls and the skills of players who've been at this for a while. Pilgrim sing about devils and tears, paying dues and surviving adventures, taking care to touch on most of the requisite tropes while not pushing any one too far. Misery Wizard isn't the sort of record whose importance will likely outlive its 55 discipleship minutes, but that has more to do with time and context than quality. This is an excellent debut from a preternaturally developed upstart. In an interview last month, BrooklynVegan baited the revivalist hook perfectly for Pilgrim, asking if the band was interested in integrating strains of other doom alloys into its sound. ""No, that stuff doesn't really interest us. We like 'true doom metal,' the classics!"" replied full-throated singer and riff-lurching guitarist the Wizard. ""We don't have time to sit around sulking. We are always ready for whatever quest lies before us."" Actually, Pilgrim sound more than ready. With a level of control that suggests contemporaries Yob, they march through each of these six tracks with steely resolve, not a miss among the bunch. The four-minute onslaught ""Adventurer"" manages all of the impact of ""Masters of the Sky"", a beastly, teasing, 11-minute trudge that spotlights the band's understanding of pacing and patience. Though their espousal of doom is spot-on, they twist a few tricks into Misery Wizard, like the coda of ""Quest"" that suggests post-rock heights and a demon-invoking chant on the back end of closer ""Forsaken Man"". And like Pallbearer, the Arkansas doom squadron whose debut arrives only a week after this one, Pilgrim are as good with vocals as without them. On opener ""Astaroth"", for instance, while the band crackles over a hypnotic groove, the Wizard's bellow retrenches the force rather than distracting from it. In spite of age or debut status, Pilgrim works as an efficient unit. That's always a pleasure to witness, no matter the transgression or relative lack thereof.","Guys with names like the Wizard, Krolg Splinterfest, Slayer of Man, and Count Elric the Soothsayer merge influences like Black Sabbath, Cathedral, and Sleep into a satisfying and distinctive whole.

In Ghostlike Fading,My Best Fiend,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37dea9e61561daa6ad5/1:1/w_160/fa7f34e7.jpeg,2012-02-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16281-in-ghostlike-fading/,Warp,"It's not usually a good sign when being from Brooklyn is a new band's major talking point. And even if Warp is still mostly considered a forward-thinking electronic label, it shouldn't be much of shock when they release something doesn't sound exactly like Autechre-- see Grizzly Bear, Born Ruffians, Maximo Park. But this Bushwick-via-Philly quintet's debut album somehow manages to exist in both of those realms. Despite being so out of character and anti-fashionable, it circles around to be its own kind of fashionability. While Fred Coldwell sings with a Yankee accent, this bleary-eyed and heartsick comedown rock is almost always associated with the UK or called ""classic rock"" by people who like to believe the Velvet Underground's popularity is equal to their influence. More than anything, In Ghostlike Fading sets out to make you think, ""they really don't make 'em like this anymore."" Or, more accurately, they haven't made 'em like this since 2008. That's the last time we got new albums from Spiritualized and the Verve. My Best Fiend come from a similar place, one where, to borrow a phrase from Richard Ashcroft, the drugs still work and they just make you worse. That said, In Ghostlike Fading lacks those bands' dope-sickness or cosmonautic ambition. Most of these songs follow a similar pattern: a few basic chords strummed on an acoustic soon joined by Coldwell's pleasingly adenoidal sneer, maybe a little electric piano or bluesy noodling tossed in to make it clear things are just warming up. The drums eventually come in and play so intently and unobtrusively that it's easy to overlook that they go missing for several minutes at a time. And then those same chords get played louder, and maybe a saxophone or slightly gospel-infused backing vocals makes things a little more widescreen but never too overblown. Given these elements, I can't help but think of In Ghostlike Fading personified as a dumpy apartment of college kids hungover on keg beer milling about, shooting the shit, and waiting for that one last guy to come out of hiding so they can finally get some brunch. Which is to say that even with the cushy song lengths and top-shelf influences, In Ghostlike Fading feels like comfort food. There are certainly individual moments that stand out-- ""Cracking Eggs"" spends approximately 60 percent of its runtime in climax mode, windmilling guitar chords and massing group vocals on top of each other. On the opposite end, the gorgeous title track creates a florid, stare-at-the-sun psychedelia, and the ethereal arpeggios that cycle through the entirety of closing waltz ""On the Shores of the Infinite"" follow in that vein with an almost creepy delicateness. But for all of its immediate pleasure, In Ghostlike Fading feels slightly vacant, valuing tribute and stylization above personal expression. Sonically, My Best Fiend have enough ""copy of a copy"" accusations to face, and Coldwell's lyrics are fittingly heavy on standard religious tropes and vague drug references placed just so that In Ghostlike Fading feels often inexpressive beyond a surface level (and potentially raises the question of just how much Chris Owens' biography influences our assessment of Girls' doing something similar). Take, appropriately enough, ""Jesus Christ"", if the mere title of the supine acoustic strummer ""One Velvet Day"" doesn't do it. I have no reason to think the feeling behind something like, ""Jesus Christ, I know that I'm wrong/ But I swear to God, I won't do it much longer,"" is somehow inauthentic-- lord knows, it's not aiming for the zeitgeist. But similar platitudes pop up all too frequently. My Best Fiend can charm by never betraying the fact that they're still young, and it's understandable that they have a better feel for their record collection than they do their own voices. So In Ghostlike Fading shows a group still admirably ready to open up for arena bands or play early daytime shifts at festivals. It's not a stretch to think My Best Fiend's next batch of songs could come from those experiences, and hopefully they can do more to make them sound like theirs alone.","This Brooklyn band on Warp swirls together influences including the Verve, Spiritualized, and the Velvet Underground, aiming for a familiar kind of drug-sick state of grace.

Hive Mind,Ital,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35c5e6ef95969322447/1:1/w_160/f7e3f130.jpeg,2012-02-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16256-hive-mind/,Planet Mu,"Daniel Martin-McCormick is unconcerned with neatness. Throughout his work with Mi Ami, Sex Worker, and Black Eyes, and now as Ital, his music betrays an intentional, fuck-all messiness he uses to explore the carnal and sinister. Ital is Martin-McCormick's house-music project, or more accurately, the project in which he jumbles up house signifiers until they represent something sloppy and shaggy. Hive Mind is his first full-length as Ital after three excellent 2011 12""s helped launch Not Not Fun sublabel 100% Silk's foray into electronic dance music. A sound-world almost pathologically obsessed with its own neatness, house is an excellent foil for Martin-McCormick. It wasn't always this way: In its early Midwest ""disco on a budget"" incarnations, house music's wild, amateur, and experimental nature overwhelmed the mechanical precision of drum machines. Hive Mind isn't nostalgic, necessarily, but its unhinged attitude has more in common with early Trax recordings than, say, the note-perfect imitations offered by revivalist acts such as Azari & III. Those early recordings were oriented toward social and communal issues; Hive Mind is smaller and more private. It's body music meant for the mind, though some distance from the living-room techno peddled by labels such as Smallville and Dial. Recognizable four-on-the-floor kick drums provide a backbone from which Martin-McCormick can hang his gargled synths. In this way the beat and the tempos are familiar, but everything else is askew. See the diva-soup of album opener ""Doesn't Matter (If You Love Him)"", which samples Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston. The message is simple enough-- dance music's wailing mantras are vainer and darker than their lyrical content often implies-- but the method is eerie and confrontational. ""Floridian Void""'s glistening synths might've been an anthem, but Martin-McCormick interrupts them with half-heard conversations. Snippets of oration also dominate ""Israel"" before it settles into a slurred cowbell groove. Again, mind over matter: If the point of Hive Mind is to gain purchase on the dance floor, there are easier ways to go about it. This mangled formalism is new for Martin-McCormick, who has traditionally operated under the everything-goes umbrella of post-punk (the interstitial industrial workout ""Privacy Settings"" is the only track here that forfeits composure). Martin-McCormick retains his fondness for long, engrossing pieces, stretching three Hive Mind tracks past the 10-minute mark. Unconcerned with whipping dancers into a frenzy, the tracks shift and swing unexpectedly. ""First Wave"", which contrasts a sickly sweet synth melody with grumpy, tumultuous rhythms, drops its melody repeatedly and randomly, and the result is the rare house track that feels as if it's decaying rather than building. The massed, clipping vocals of ""Doesn't Matter"" are annoying, intentionally so. Sonically familiar, Hive Mind subverts the expectations and structures of house music. Perhaps you prefer the wild imagination of Mi Ami or Sex Worker; what Martin-McCormick accomplishes on Hive Mind is trickier and, frankly, more impressive. He's hardly the first artist to turn an experimental eye toward house, but his instincts are good, and it seems that he could churn out proper bangers if he weren't so mischievous. Important too is that Hive Mind doesn't feel wholly loving: There's healthy skepticism built into these readings, which are less about tearing down walls than rearranging the furniture. By reining in his more abstract impulses, Martin-McCormick has delivered as messy and thoughtful a take on house as we're likely to hear this year.","On his debut Ital LP, Daniel Martin-McCormick (Mi Ami, Sex Worker, Black Eyes), jumbles familiar house signifiers until they represent something sloppy, shaggy, and surprisingly thoughtful.

Reign of Terror,Sleigh Bells,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b394b1335d7bf169a5fc/1:1/w_160/1d9cc6c5.jpg,2012-02-20 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16297-reign-of-terror/,Mom + Pop,"Sleigh Bells arrived fully formed with blunt rock riffs, crunk beats, and airy, feminine vocals. Their debut, Treats, may be the first record to fetishize the negative consequences of the Loudness War, with guitarist and producer Derek E. Miller pushing an already bombastic sound to absurd extremes by deliberately narrowing the music's dynamic range to the point of clipping even at moderate volumes. Treats owes its greatness to its simple, direct hooks, but the band's overly hot recordings were also thrilling in that they tapped into our positive associations with cranking stereos up to the maximum volume because we loved what we were hearing. Sleigh Bells' second album, Reign of Terror, is plenty loud, but it doesn't rely on this volume trick. Instead, the duo emphasizes the delicate elements of their sound that mostly got crowded out in the midrange of Treats' speaker-melting din. Alexis Krauss, the former teen-pop singer turned punk-rock badass, is foregrounded throughout the record, and her roots in Clinton-era bubblegum are more fully integrated with Miller's heavy riffing. The beats are less indebted to hip-hop this time around and the guitar parts have gone full-on metal, alternating between elemental AC/DC-like hooks and late-80s harmonics. Reign of Terror is a brash, hyperactive set of songs, but Miller and Krauss' synthesis of disparate strands is exceptionally graceful, with traditionally macho and girly sounds flowing together seamlessly in dynamic, often ecstatic pop tunes. They refine their take on girl-group pop and cheerleader chants on ""Leader of the Pack"" and ""Crush"", and set shoegazer swooning to machine-gun drum fills on ""Born to Lose"". More impressively, Krauss' melodies somersault over Miller's waves of alt-rock buzz guitar and colorful keyboards on ""Comeback Kid"", and they fully commit to the gentle, sentimental melodies of ""End of the Line"" without compromising their noisy aesthetic. ""You Lost Me"", one of three consecutive songs that lean hard on metal harmonics at the end of the set, is straight-up gorgeous, with layers of clean notes, slow-motion drones, and breathy coos building to a headbanging catharsis. Sleigh Bells pull off this more sophisticated and nuanced approach without calling attention to their improved craft or maturity. They remain obsessed with overwhelming their audience with excitement and pleasure, and their heaviest moments on Reign of Terror eclipse those on Treats. ""Demons"", the record's fist-pumping centerpiece, is an adrenaline rush sustained over three minutes, with Krauss affecting her most sinister tone above an overpowering riff straight out of the (original) ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" series. Miller has mastered the big dumb riff, but his arrangements are full of subtle touches that embellish and reinforce the bludgeoning attack of his chords. All through Reign of Terror, he and Krauss hit upon an ideal balance of texture and simplicity, expanding on their basic formula without losing any of their direct, unfussy charm. The band makes such incredibly physical music that the lyrics would seem to be beside the point, but it's notable that so many songs on both records are fixated on winning and losing. This isn't a surprise, really-- given the triumphant sound of this music, what else would you want to sing over it? Krauss often sings from the perspective of a supportive confidant, offering a sweet pep talk on ""Comeback Kid"", or empathizing with a friend's suicidal thoughts on ""Born to Lose"". She spends a good chunk of Reign of Terror dwelling on the aftermath of violence and tragedy, seeking out ways of coping, moving on, and thriving despite the chaos. Themes of suicide pop up throughout the album, climaxing with ""You Lost Me"", which seems to be at least partly inspired by a pair of Nevada teens who attempted suicide while listening to Judas Priest in 1985. (One survived and their parents famously sued the band.) Krauss avoids moralizing on the subject, opting instead to project understanding and concern. In a small way, her approach is refreshing and subversive-- this sort of aggressive, over-the-top rock is traditionally a vehicle for narcissism, but she invests this music with kind-hearted concern for others.","Sleigh Bells' brash, hyperactive sophomore album is plenty loud. This time around, though, the duo emphasize the delicate elements of their sound in service of dynamic and ecstatic pop tunes.

Existers,Lucky Dragons,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39ec0084474cd0c2161/1:1/w_160/bde7d546.jpeg,2012-02-17 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16303-existers/,Swill Children,"While the Los Angeles-based duo Lucky Dragons utilizes music in its interdisciplinary work, it's not really a band. Sarah Rara and Luke Fischbeck clearly favor museums and galleries over concert halls and nightclubs. They pay more attention to context than content, and spontaneous audience interaction (in the Pauline Oliveros mold) is at the heart of their project. Their albums tend to feel like annexes of what they call ""interactive performances and installations,"" rather than self-contained works measurable by conventional standards. But as disjointed as Widows and Dream Island Laughing Language could be, they were redeemed by their energy and zippy ideas, which had cumulative force even when they were individually slight. If one electro-acoustic doodad didn't interest you, another was always right on its heels. It's hard to make the same concession to the new Existers, where the ideas are almost insultingly thin. After recording uncharacteristic drones ""inside of an egg, a pyramid, and on top of a mountain"" for 2011's Shape Tape, Lucky Dragons return to the techno-tribal primitivism of their earlier albums on this limited-edition collaboration with visual artist Jesse Hlebo of Swill Children. Dominated by tuned and textured percussion, the marbled tones of modular synthesizers, and electronically dismembered voices, it's full of sounds that get stuck and repeat, inert elements clashing with constantly changing ones, and harmonic patterns that spectrally multiply. Sometimes, it strikes a decent balance between the grimy attack of Excepter and the dreamy flow of Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Often, it sounds like scraps Gang Gang Dance would have left on the figurative cutting-room floor. The album is startlingly profligate with its 21-minute lifespan, casting about for inspiration as if it's got all day. Indifferent sequencing shines a harsh light on Existers' dearth of content. Only three of its seven songs are developed enough to earn the designation, and they occupy track positions one, two, and six. Brief interstitials can work great between substantial compositions-- that's why they're called interstitials!-- but three of them in a row is not a good look. After the lightweight but adequately wrought arcs of the title track and ""What You See is What You Get"", we're left to stare down the barrel of a couple of happy accidents with a looping pedal and a reprise of an already worn-out motif, until the purposefully driving ""Mirror Makers"" seems to capture Lucky Dragons remembering that this is supposed to be an album for other humans to enjoy, not a private jam session. That all flies out the window on ""No Weapons"", where Fischbeck just sings the title over some kalimba-sounding tones for a couple of minutes, and we're done. Lucky Dragons are in the habit of sandbagging their music with outrageously elevated rhetoric, and Existers is no exception. ""EXISTERS,"" we're told, ""resist without intervening, subsist without consuming."" It's a meretricious piety that becomes flat-out absurd when attached to a physical, commercial artifact that creates imaginary value through artificial scarcity. At best, it's disingenuously flattering; at worst, it reveals a fatal blind spot between what Lucky Dragons are doing and what they think they're doing. The very real dilemma for artists who are wary of the marketplace-- to make products or not to make products?-- is not satisfactorily resolved by making half-assed products under the guise of some vague brand of resistance. All praises due to those who break the mold, but if you're going to make (and sell) a record? Make a fucking record.","The L.A.-based duo of Sarah Rara and Luke Fischbeck return to the techno-tribal primitivism of their earlier albums on this limited-edition collaboration with the visual artist Jesse Hlebo.

Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees,Liberteer,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39513d197565213a979/1:1/w_160/0c6f733b.jpg,2012-02-17 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16299-better-to-die-on-your-feet-than-live-on-your-knees/,Relapse,"Matthew Widener, who played in the gory grind crew Exhumed in the mid 1990s, formed the Carcass-inspired grind trio the County Medical Examiners, and still performs in Cretin, the trio fronted by guitarist/vocalist Marissa Martinez (one of the only transgender people I can think of in extreme metal), shifted the name of his longtime political grindcore band Citizen to Liberteer as he got deeper into anarchism. He handles everything on Liberteer's debut, Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees, a compact but exceedingly expansive grind record packed with major-key riffs, digitized horns, real-life banjos, mandolin, martial drumming, blast beats, and the lyrics you'd expect from the setup and the CrimethInc.-like vibe of the album title. His words are unrelenting. Widener isn't one for metaphor or couching things in poetry. You can delve into the lyric sheet (""To birth a world, the first must die,"" ""Killing never justified itself/ But sometimes you must fight/ When peaceful protests choke in tear gas/ Blitz in black bloc squads,"" ""To be happy, god damn it, kill those who own property"") or focus on songs with titles such as ""We Are Not Afraid of Ruins"" and ""Class War Never Meant More Than It Does Now"". (Then there's the booklet that comes with the album and gives instructions on how to use the case, the CD, and said booklet as a weapon, as a way to hop barbed wire fences, as a stencil for graffitti, as a bomb, etc.) Better to Die opens with ""The Falcon Cannot Hear the Falconer"", a short instrumental that takes its name from W.B. Yeats' much-quoted poem ""The Second Coming"". Despite its context, anarchy, in the descriptive sense, doesn't come across in the music itself: Widener, who also records classical music, carefully composed these 27 minutes. Repeated motifs echo throughout the collection; specific guitar parts resurface. The 17 songs bleed and blend. There's an overall arc as well as the in-song drama. It's a tightly contained outburst. The first proper track, ""Build No System"", incorporates triumphant horns and flutes into its final section, and it comes over like Napalm Death clobbering John Philip Sousa. Another track, ""Usurious Epitaph"" basically breaks into ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" at the 42-second mark. ""99 to 1"" works in some electronics that would sound dance-y even without transforming into the weirdo ""Chariots of Fire"" grind of instrumental ""Sweat for Blood"". If not for the crunchy distorted guitars, the banjo and horn-lined ""Rise Like Lions After Slumber"" would make sense at a Stare Fair hoedown. Thing is, even when he's not incorporating these oddball flourishes, Better to Die is a memorable, staggeringly detailed, shout-along collection. (Grindcore doesn't often sound this big.) Widener's decision to place his very real call for action in this anthemic, angry, surprisingly catchy (and just plain surprising) grindcore was a smart one. More than any album I've heard in recent years, Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees reminds me of the more idealistic, early-20s version of myself who moved West with a sleeping bag and some books, to basically dumpster dive, write, and read anarchist theory and Beckett, who I thought could teach me something very real with his expansive use of minimalism. I got older and more cynical, and rejected anarchism for various reasons, but Better to Die is the kind of record that draws that line in the sand again. It reminded me how good it feels to want to tear things down; more importantly, Widener has the intelligence and ambition to create something new in the process.","This surprising grindcore record from Matthew Widener of Exhumed adds digitized horns, banjos, and martial drumming to the aggressive splatter, coming over like Napalm Death clobbering John Philip Sousa.

The Russian Wilds,Howlin Rain,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39cc0084474cd0c215e/1:1/w_160/0d0778a5.jpeg,2012-02-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16302-howlin-rain-the-russian-wilds/,American,"There was a time when most rock bands would gladly have tossed their bass player off of a cliff for the chance to snatch a lock of Rick Rubin's beard hair, let alone coax the reclusive record producer and Def Jam label impresario into a studio. But the aspiring rockers of the post-file-sharing era may want to consult Howlin' Rain's The Russian Wilds, and then reassess whether or not courting the nation's leading rock'n'roll yogi is worth the time and effort. Crafted over a period of four years with extensive guidance from Rubin, the San Francisco quintet's latest full-length has all the tropes of a record-as-game-changer-- it's moody and duende-soaked, meticulously crafted, and sprawling in its ambition. But The Russian Wilds is not the neo-jam-band classic it might have been. A conscious stab at classic album-making-- with all of the madness, obsession, and studio overtime that allegedly entails-- The Russian Wilds strives for timelessness, but sounds temporally adrift. In 2006, Howlin' Rain were little more than singer/guitarist Ethan Miller's side project-- a groovy aside to his main gig with psych-rock kamikazes Comets on Fire. But it had a niche. Where Comets skewed toward scuzzy chaos, Howlin' Rain made a conscious effort to splice the mellow sounds of 1970s radio past with New Weird America present. ""I was trying to make it represent the nature and vibe of California, musically,"" Miller told Arthur magazine in an interview that trailed the group's self-titled release. ""I wanted to sonically represent the history of California bands."" That article brought the band to the attention of Rubin, who, after being suitably impressed with the band's live show, released Howlin' Rain's sophomore LP, Magnificent Fiend, on his imprint, American Recordings, and offered to produce its next album. Nearly half a decade later, the work is done. In the years that it took to make The Russian Wilds, entire bands have gone from 7"" to LP to bargain bin. Most of Howlin' Rain's new-weird peers-- like Comets on Fire or Brightblack Morning Light-- have either broken up or receded from the spotlight. Times have changed. Howlin' Rain have, too. During the intervening years, the group has been almost entirely re-staffed, with only Miller and keyboardist/guitarist Joel Robinow sticking around from the Magnificent Fiend lineup. But there's been a distinct sonic shift as well. At Rubin's urging, the band has moved its classic-rock reference points southward-- away from Bay Area favorites like the Grateful Dead and toward Los Angeles groups such as Little Feat and the Eagles. The riffs are softer and funkier, not that far adrift from the shores of yacht rock. Miller has refined his singing style, too. Where he used to bleat and holler like Ted Nugent's punk-rock grandson, here he dials back the wailing in favor of clarity. The band's ear for epic prog-rock pageantry remains intact. Many of the songs on The Russian Wilds muscle past the six-minute mark, letting Miller and lead guitarist Isaiah Mitchell (on loan from San Diego stoner titans Earthless) exercise their shreddiest instincts. On album opener ""Self Made Man"", three-part harmonies and gentle strumming give way to dueling dive-bomb solos. The band's new-weird chops are more visible here than in the past if only because they stand in sharper juxtaposition to Miller's soft-rock songwriting. As a producer, Rubin pushes hard for songwriters to reach into deep, dark places and wring out the bleak bile of their soul in song. Miller meets that challenge with lyrics about suicide (""Strange Thunder""), self-doubt (""Self Made Man""), and regret (""Can't Satisfy Me Now""). But gloom and doom aren't a natural fit for Howlin' Rain. The Russian Wilds' main failing, though, is that, in comparison to the band's concerts, it feels flat. According to Miller, Rubin put him through his paces during the demo process-- pushing the band to write and discard an extra album's worth of material and to set aside its notions of genre. But genre writing is central to Howlin' Rain's appeal. On Magnificent Fiend the band was blissfully aware that it was a punked-up cartoon of 1970s rock. On The Russian Wilds, their sense of purpose sounds clouded, and the performances ultimately suffer. The force of self-examination sands down the band's ecstatic energy. In interviews, Miller is honest that the making of The Russian Wilds was, for the most part, a drag. Never in a rush to get anything done, Rubin would disappear for long periods of time, leaving the band high and dry. That's one thing when a band is financially independent, but another when you're recording a group of California psych-rock lifers who are struggling to pay rent. Had all of the self-help and record-studio psychodrama been set aside, there's every reason to believe that Howlin' Rain could have simply bashed out The Russian Wilds in a weekend and moved on.","Crafted over four years, the San Francisco psych-rock quintet's Rick Rubin-produced third album has all the tropes of a record-as-game-changer.

The Broken Man,Matt Elliott,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38e13d197565213a96d/1:1/w_160/185f1d7b.jpg,2012-02-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16294-the-broken-man/,Ici d'Ailleurs,"The career of Matt Elliott feels like it's been conducted in a peculiar half-light. The Bristol expat doesn't appear to care too much for exposure, quietly releasing album after album either as a progenitor of the kind of dusky soundscapes dubstep would come to inhabit under his Third Eye Foundation guise, or turning to the mopey ruin of the folk-tinged work under his own name. The Broken Man is his latest stab at the latter, a rigidly austere set of seven songs enveloped in blood, sorrow, and torment. At times it feels like Elliott made it after falling flat on the studio floor, face down, choking on dust and bitter rumination. But these aren't ""small"" songs; this is an all-encompassing misery, grandiose in its own way, with great rushes of strings and doomy multi-tracked vocal hums zooming into the frame to pull Elliott up by his bootstraps. On the lengthy ""Oh How We Fell"", there's even the clang of an ominous church bell, acting as a wonderfully dramatic portent of changes in mood and focus. Elliott has sunk down to this place before, on equally remorseful work such as the appropriately titled Drinking Songs from 2005. The touchstones here are similar. When he lets his pangs of grief flush out on lengthy tracks such as ""If Anyone Tells Me 'It's Better to Have Loved and Lost Than to Never Have Loved at All' I Will Stab Them in the Face"", it's reminiscent of the sweeping mixture of guts and grief that make up Dirty Three's stylistic métier. Like that band's music, there's a ruptured form of beauty here too, and it's one that takes a great deal of care and consideration to uncover. The standout ""Dust, Flesh and Bones"" takes numerous plays to really get to grips with its one-part Leonard Cohen-esque lament, one-part lawless-border-town feel. These songs are cloaked in darkness on initial plays, with Elliott building an impenetrable wall around them, only to remove it brick by brick over time. It's a combination of his meticulous attention to detail and a knack for knowing how to let song structures softly contract into new shapes that makes it work. The joins don't show when ""This Is For"" turns from a quietly picked acoustic folk number into a stridently thumbed Spanish guitar piece. Elliott takes that initiative and picks it up again in the following song, ""The Pain That's Yet to Come"", matching the same guitar style to a backdrop of Caligulan cries and moans and great rushes of noise, providing a neat conceptual loop back to similar work earlier in the album. At times there's a mixture of the pit-of-despair weight of Townes van Zandt's best tracks and the light/dark dynamic the most recent incarnation of Swans is so immersed in. The close of ""Oh How We Fell"", where filmy acoustic work falls into a deep well of gravely sighs and operatic trills, feels like the world turning upside-down following a swift kick to the feet of Elliott's barstool. The Broken Man is a brawny, robust album, the type of record that carries an uncommon weight and honesty. When Elliott darkly intones, ""this is how it feels to be alone,"" on ""Dust, Flesh and Bones"", there's complete conviction in his dead-eyed delivery, conveying an unwavering faith in his emotional regression. In lesser hands it's a line that could read as trite; with Elliott it feels well-worn, as though it's been churning around his head for years, gathering emotional baggage with the passing of time. But this isn't just a highly crafted plummet to the depths. There's an eerie, unearthly sense of displacement to much of the material, such as the spindly cries of bowed saw (or something simulating the sound of one) on ""How to Kill a Rose"". Those atmospheric touches make this feel like Elliott's most complete work to date, forming a vital link between his sunless balladry and the shattered electronica of Third Eye Foundation.","The Bristol-born folk musician, who records electronic music as Third Eye Foundation, offers a robust, atmospheric set of songs enveloped in blood, sorrow, and torment.

Visions,Grimes,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32213d197565213a8c0/1:1/w_160/42bf6de8.jpeg,2012-02-17 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/,4ADArbutus,"As a child I feared the day the world would be taken over by robots; these days I am seized by a much more potent fear that I am becoming one. Digital interfaces invade our imagination in strange, tangible ways, and with each day I spend in front of my computer screen, the red Gchat dots representing my friends and co-workers start to look more and more like HAL. Have you ever caught yourself trying to open a new tab in your brain? Was the Wikipedia blackout of 2012 as important a cultural moment as the New York City blackout of '77? Do androids dream of electric sheep, or do you not have an app for that yet? ""Post-internet"" is a term that's stuck all too easily (guilty as charged) to Grimes' airy cyborg-pop, thanks in part to her endless quotability in acknowledging the digital world's influence on her aesthetic (""The music of my childhood was really diverse because I had access to everything."") But Visions, the latest and best album from one-woman project of Montreal-based Claire Boucher, complicates the all-too-tidy ""post-internet"" tag by bringing into focus the many contrasts at the heart of her music: tensions between pop structure and diffuse atmosphere, between technology and the human body, between sensory-overloaded hyper-presence and transcendence. More solidly constructed and a lot more fun to listen to than anything she's put her name to so far, the electro cotton-candy of Visions is an inviting entrance into Grimes' peculiar kind of bliss. On her first albums, Geidi Primes and Halfaxa, Grimes buried pop impulses within textured muck and gloomy tones. But Visions finds Boucher mining not just the clean brightness of Aphex Twin-like atmospherics but also the immediacy of straight-up mall-pop: ""Vowels = space and time"" recalls nothing so much as Stacey Q's 1986 hit ""Two of Hearts"", while ""Infinite Love Without Fulfillment"" sounds like Boucher broke into the Apple store after hours and turned on all the display iPads to the same Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam video, rhythmically looped into something sublime. Some of Grimes' reference points call to mind the experimental pop of Nite Jewel or some of the artists on the 100% Silk roster. But that music seems interested in obscuring pop's immediacy or keeping a distance from the pleasure center, while Visions is an unabashed embrace of its source material, whether it's K-pop, new age, or bubblegum. Boucher spends most of Visions singing in a vaporous falsetto. She occasionally manipulates her voice (as on the steely, Transformers-jam ""Eight"") but mostly she just loops it, layers it, and cloaks it in reverb; there are moments when what she's doing doesn't sound too far off from what Julianna Barwick's music might sound like if she were interested in making a synth-pop record. The most common complaint I've heard of Grimes come from people wishing her songs were more structured or hooky, or that her voice was more ""present."" But-- never mind the fact that even the haziest moments on the record are anchored by melody-- this diffuseness is one of Visions' most refreshing charms. Another oft-cited quote from Boucher the ""post-internet"" poster girl: ""Basically I'm really impressionable and have no sense of consistency in anything I do."" This is pop music for ambient fans, but it's also a welcome change for anyone exhausted by post-Gaga pop's tethers to artifice, theatricality, and skronky, turned-up-to-11 beats. To reach out and touch this music would be like putting your hand through a cloud. But there's still that tension: Song titles such as ""Be a Body"", ""Visiting Statue"", and ""Skin"" are all testaments to Visions' interest in the corporeal. When she sings the titular lyric on ""Be a Body"", it sounds like a nagging request to come back down to earth, while ""Skin"" (which has a sputtering sensuality, like a robot programmed to write a slow jam) feels even more revealing: ""Soft skin/ You touch me with it and so I know I can be human once again."" Still, don't confuse these moments with any kind of new-agey, back-to-nature longing. One spin of ""Genesis"" is enough prove it: Post-humanism sounds like a blast. Late last year, Simon Reynolds described electronic music's response to our digitized world as a new kind of maximalism: ""a hell of a lot of inputs... in terms of influences and sources, and a hell of a lot of outputs."" That's an apt description for the music that Grimes was making before, but Visions showcases a streamlined aesthetic, resulting in a statement that feels focused, cohesive, and assured. It's simple enough to leave room for Grimes to grow, but this thing is so compulsively listenable it's hard to come away from it wanting much more. Anchored to the digital imagination but unbridled from its skittish anxiety and concerns, Visions gestures skyward and beyond.","Grimes is the one-woman cyborg-pop project of Montreal's Claire Boucher.

Living Room Songs / Another Happy Day OST,Ólafur Arnalds,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3919d034d5c69bf4d26/1:1/w_160/8f013743.jpeg,2012-02-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16296-living-room-songs-another-happy-day-ost/,Erased Tapes,"Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds enjoys presenting and releasing music in unusual ways. Tracks from his 2009 album Found Songs were offered via Twitter the day they were recorded, and he's done concerts with the music improvised completely on the fly. One of his two recent projects continues along this path but introduces another technological twist. With Living Room Songs, Arnalds again released a week's worth of songs one at a time, but this time he taped the recordings and put them on YouTube. Made in his Reykjavik apartment, the videos are spare and straightforward, with slow-pan shots of his kitchen and bookshelf. Arnalds orchestrates from his piano while assorted musicians (usually string players) flesh out his subdued modern classical arrangements. There's a voyeuristic kick you get watching these clips, not only from seeing Arnalds' creative process but his actual home-- his couches and friends and personal belongings. The question is whether this music transcends the concept, if the songs function on their own apart from the YouTube format. Arnalds has released them as an album, so presumably he thinks so, but I'm not as certain. From opener ""Fyrsta"" to the plaintive ""Tomorrow's Song"", the tracks feel more like sketches than fully formed compositions. Most begin as slow, deliberate piano arrangements, sometimes incorporating strings or synths along the way, but rarely amount to more than a gentle hum. The music is pretty but still-- without many shifts in color or tone, they sit there like flat, two-dimensional objects. Arnalds' other new project, a film score for Sam Levinson's Another Happy Day, provides an interesting contrast. The soundtrack builds on some of the ideas from Living Room Songs and has a similar melancholy vibe (the movie is pretty bleak), but is more realized. There's the same patient minimalism (Arnalds seems to like drawing as much out of one note before moving on to the next) but where that made for inert compositions before, here they sound polished, almost regal. The best cuts find Arnalds unafraid to blend genres and mix in the electronic flourishes we heard on his earlier records. A good example is closer ""Everything Must Change"", which creates a menacing atmosphere from violin plucks, synth stabs, and a heavy hip-hop drum break. You don't need the story or the visual to feel the tension in it. Another Happy Day doesn't always work as well as a standalone object. Film scores are admittedly tough, because people expect them to act like regular albums when they're usually designed to play a supporting role. The best soundtracks can and do build compelling sonic worlds apart from movies, though, and recent examples include Trent Reznor's work on The Social Network or Cliff Martinez's on Drive. Arnalds' score ultimately isn't as satisfying, especially in the front half where he's excessively patient and slow to build momentum. It can feel stiff, formal. Still, the score proves a much better vehicle for him than the immediacy of YouTube.

Orcas,Orcas,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38d13d197565213a969/1:1/w_160/04ded8e0.jpeg,2012-02-16 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16293-orcas/,Morr,"The question isn't why Thomas Meluch (aka Benoît Pioulard) and Rafael Anton Irisarri decided to work together; it's what took them so long. While Meluch's music often resembles an amnesiac crooner making up karaoke lyrics for Boards of Canada instrumentals, and Irisarri splits the difference between Harold Budd and Gas (trending post-minimal under his own name and electronic as the Sight Below), both of them freely muddle up ambient, classical, electronic, and pop idioms in search of the ideal blend of melodic immediacy and formal opacity. And they've been moving in the same interlocked circles for years, recording for most of the bigger labels that steward this furtive electro-acoustic stuff: Kranky and Type (Pioulard), Room40 and Miasmah (Irisarri), and Ghostly International (both). Ticking another one off the list, they join forces as Orcas for this modest, entrancing Morr Music debut, which sounds in reality exactly how it sounds on paper: nocturnal ambient pop in the manner of Eluvium's Similes, if Similes had benefited from the same rugged grandeur as Copia. The most distinctive and consistent feature of Meluch's music is his sedate yet expressive voice, which moves like something heavy underwater, complacently drowning (""Like coming up for air,"" he intones repeatedly on the hesitantly skipping ""Pallor Cedes""). Irisarri, meanwhile, builds elegantly decaying, chiaroscuro mosaics that seethe with electronic processing. These modes integrate naturally-- in fact, they seem to fill each other's absences. Meluch and Irisarri encase sad, twinkling pop songs for piano or guitar in slow, shuddering masses of electronic sound, striking a fine balance between lyric-driven emotional appeals and aloof abstractions. In either case, Meluch's voice is rightly the focal point, whether atomized into a hissing glow or lucidly double-tracked into streaked harmony, recalling Grizzly Bear at their duskiest-- especially on standout ""Arrow Drawn"", whose cunning melodic pleasures insinuate themselves slowly, which makes them last. There are more immediate highs as well, such as ""Until Then"", a frugal Broadcast cover for close-miked piano and dirty stylus, and ""Carrion"", a grainy, blossoming hymn. Whether menaced by growling distortion, enshrined in gusty reverb, or draped over an unadorned guitar, Meluch's tender, isolated singing is a stable fulcrum for the music's pendulous swing between extreme, gentle inertia and sudden, violent flux. This type of collaboration between experimental pop musicians can too often devolve into aimless fancywork and tech shenanigans, but Meluch and Irisarri have crafted a genuine, coherent album that conjures immense shadows and immense depths worthy of its namesake.","Electro-acoustic composers Thomas Meluch (aka Benoît Pioulard) and Rafael Anton Irisarri strike a balance between lyric-driven emotional appeals and aloof abstractions on this collection of nocturnal ambient pop.

The Hotel Sessions / Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners,The Lemonheads,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b397ea9e61561daa6aff/1:1/w_160/239a29a0.jpg,2012-02-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16298-the-hotel-sessions-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-cleaners/,Hall OfBreath of Saltwater,"There's something wistfully apt about the Lemonheads' relative obscurity. Despite a long career based on short songs, Evan Dando is neither a promising young artist anymore nor a reliably established alt act, but he still keeps chugging, unwilling to follow Buffalo Tom or Belly into that dark night. And yet, he hasn't reinvented himself as a bold businesswoman like old friend/muse Julianna Hatfield, nor has he graduated to éminence grise like fellow Bostonian J Mascis. Instead, Dando remains plain ol' Dando, occupying just enough of the public consciousness to qualify for a career but not enough to suggest a revival any time soon. Despite the recent reissue of It's a Shame About Ray, which showed just how sturdy his seemingly slight songs could be, his music is well served by his way-left-of-the-dial place in pop culture, as two new reissues reveal. For most bands, The Hotel Sessions might seem like a curious release-- or at least curiously timed. Maybe 10 years late. It's a collection of demos recorded to a friend's Walkman at a hotel in Bondi Beach, Australia. Dando says he can't remember if he recorded it at the tail end of 1992 or in the early days of 1993, but that amnesia only adds to the record's stoner charm. It's just him and an acoustic guitar, although the tape hiss and pot smoke should get songwriting credits. You can almost hear the rumpled sheets and bad painting on the wall. Most of these songs would eventually appear in polished studio form on Come on Feel the Lemonheads, which was their best-selling album but not their best and which has been dollar-bin fodder for the vast majority of its shelf life. Yet these tunes might actually have more charm in this woozy setting, as hits such as ""Into Your Arms"" sound sweeter and the line, ""If I was a booger, would you blow your nose?"" sounds bittersweeter (somehow). On the other hand, certain aspects of Dando's songwriting still sound mired in the period, as if preserved in alt amber: ""Paid to Smile"", he explains, was inspired by doing a string of radio performances with a hard-working and enthusiastic publicist. ""Please don't hold the door, I can work the handle on any door,"" he sings before dismissing her efforts summarily: ""You get paid to smile."" How 90s is that? Still, I'd much rather hear Dando's outtakes than, say, Rivers Cuomo's, if only because these pre-emo demos walk the line between introverted and extroverted rather than embrace self-absorption like a business plan. Somehow, Dando's nonchalance here-- his stoned cadences, fleeting hooks, loose-limbed guitar playing, and generally rumpled demeanor-- comes across as a weird but sincere gregariousness. That makes The Hotel Sessions an ideal Lemonheads retrospective, summing up the band's appeal more authoritatively than a conventional collection of hits ever could. Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners is a conventional collection of hits. Named after the group's first release, when Dando was the drummer, this 2xCD, UK-only comp might be too generous at nearly 50 tracks. The familiar songs are all here: ""It's a Shame About Ray"" and ""Mrs. Robinson"" serve as disc openers, and ""Into Your Arms"" and ""Frank Mills"" aren't too deep in the tracklist. But so are never-charted singles, fan faves, and deep-album cuts such as ""If I Could Talk I'd Tell You"" and ""Confetti"", which testify to Dando's deceptively tight craftsmanship. On the other hand, what does it say about your catalog when goofy, one-off, one-listen experiments like ""Rick James Style"" and your unbearably ironic New Kids on the Block cover make your greatest hits? Speaking of covers, Laughing is full of them. Dando has always cast a wide net, but the 90s being the 90s, there seems to be a cheeky ""Step by Step"" (NKOTB) for every sincere ""Frank Mills"" (Hair). Their take on Simon & Garfunkel's ""Mrs. Robinson"" still sounds fairly redundant 20 years later, although the bong solo is a nice way to undercut the generational solemnity, and Randy Alvey & the Green Fuz's ""Green Fuz"" is certainly not the obvious choice from Varshons. On the other hand, Dando's version of Michael Nesmith's ""Different Drum"" exudes all the youthful self-determination that has given the song such a long life, and ""Brass Buttons"" and ""Just Can't Take It Anymore"" suggest he might have a full-length Gram Parsons covers album in him someday. These covers are pleasant diversions, never definitive but not without a sense of self-critical commentary either. Dando is telling us how to listen to his music and how to triangulate his sound, which is more than Laughing does. By forgoing a chronological tracklist in favor of a jumble of tunes, the comp downplays any sense of transformation and growth, suggesting a flatness to Dando's craft. Rambunctious early tracks ""Mallo Cup"" and ""Hate Your Friends"" jostle against cleaner, more streamlined tunes ""The Turnpike Down"" and ""Pittsburgh"", but Laughing doesn't note the discrepancy, much less explain it. It's not that the Lemonheads demand a strict history, but there's no animating thesis here, no sense of the shape of Dando's improbable career. In short, there's no reason why we're listening to these particular songs in this particular order. All this comp tells us is that Dando wrote some great songs over the last 25 years, but we knew that already.","The Hotel Sessions, a collection of demos recorded to a Walkman in 1992, and Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners, a conventional 2xCD collection of hits, offer different looks at some great songs Evan Dando wrote over the last 25 years.

Trap Back,Gucci Mane,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37c9d034d5c69bf4cff/1:1/w_160/5c515060.jpg,2012-02-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16280-gucci-mane-trap-back/,1017 Brick Squad,"Even back in 2009, when Gucci Mane seemed momentarily poised to conquer the known rap universe, there was something combustible about him. His career trajectory felt grease-slicked and frightening, like he was in a car fish-tailing across a major highway, and Gucci did his best, in his music, to reinforce this sensation: Two of his most-repeated ad-libs (""nyyyyyaooooowwww"", ""SKRRT! SKRRT!"") are the sounds of high-speed vehicles spinning out of control. Everything that has happened to him since then-- arrests, jail time, abuse cases-- illustrates the sad difference between the artist who courts chaos and the artist who succumbs to it. Everyone loves a live wire when they're sparking, but the flip side of ""live wire"" is, of course, ""perpetual fuck-up."" Gucci fans and rubberneckers alike have had more than enough of both sides to last them a few years. To have fallen in love with Gucci's drunken-carnival rendering of gangsta rap, then, is to have learned to take what you can get from him, when and where you can get it. I may be alone on the internet in admitting it, but I enjoyed BAYTL, his inexplicable, internet-baiting team-up with Kreayshawn associate and deeply lamentable human being V-Nasty, simply because it provided several solid-to-great Gucci verses alongside production by frequent collaborator Zaytoven, whose best beats sound like they're built entirely from Dippin' Dots. Gucci never conquered the rap world-- sales figures for The State vs. Radric Davis, his best shot, roughly equalled that of the Game's last studio album. But nothing has been able to quite stop him and, every once in a while, he still surprises us with something great. Trap Back, his latest release with noted mixtape curator and professional loud person DJ Holiday, is just that: great. It isn't as great as The Movie 3-D or the first Writing on the Wall mixtape. Or Gucci Sosa or even the 10-track Gucciamerica throwaway or The Gooch Man or any number of his past classics. But like all his best music, it is colorful and interesting and flagrantly dumb and sneakily clever, all at once. His mush-mouth buries the details of his writing so deep that you'd have to spend ages picking them out, but on a good Gucci verse, you can feel them flying by on first pass, content in the knowledge that you will be able to revisit and explore them later. In the dope-sales reminiscence of ""Back in 95"", details like ""Smokers didn't know my name, so they used to call me Black"" and ""Dope-fiend Willie used to finger-fuck my rims"" leap out and instantly signify a great rapper firing on all cylinders. Gucci's best verses are also insanely memorable; it's very hard to walk away from his music without at least two or three phrases doing the dryer-cycle tumble through your mind. His voice is a difficult instrument to describe: Pitched somewhere between whine and blare, he sometimes sounds like a huge, overgrown baby who's bumped his head on a table corner. But the way he uses it to take apart words and put them back together with strange new emphases-- ""Ghett-O, a-LASK-a, ghett-O, neBRASKa""; ""I'm in the trap house, with SHOES on""-- is a brain-teasing pleasure. The phrasing in his best raps feels sticky, like a filthy movie theater floor under sneakers: ""I drop the top like 'fuck it'/ I'm not in no lil' Cutlass/ I pull up in the 'What the?'/ Fuck, I don't know was it"" he teases on ""Plain Jane"". On ""Thank You"", he unleashes this thick, transcription-worthy run: ""Count a hundred in Syria/ Peanut-butter interior/ My jewelry game on Frigidaire, my watch game cold as Siberia/ Gucci Mane, is you serious? Hell yeah, I'm serious/ Red watch with a red chain, my diamonds on they period."" The other reason Trap Back is great is the increasingly prominent Atlanta producer Mike Will Made It, who continues to demonstrate that he has an ear for the smallest details that make a simple rap song a great rap song. His sound is like a Flubberized blending of Zaytoven's 8-bit pings and Drumma Boy's funeral marches: it's menacing and playful all at once, which means its a perfect match for Gucci's style. In a development that really shouldn't have taken this long, he flips the Tetris theme into trap music for Gucci to rap on for ""Get It Back"". The instrumental could serve as a neatly boiled-down synopsis of Gucci's style: simple, deceptively absorbing, maddeningly addictive, frantically paced. Drumma Boy also swings by, and Zaytoven contributes some of his gangsta tinker-toy productions. The result isn't a revelation exactly, but it's the most recognizably Gucci-ish Gucci release in some time.","Like his best music, Gucci Mane's release with noted mixtape curator DJ Holiday is colorful, interesting, flagrantly dumb, and sneakily clever.

Animal Joy,Shearwater,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3789d034d5c69bf4cf9/1:1/w_160/1301df60.jpeg,2012-02-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16277-animal-joy/,Sub Pop,"Shearwater are often considered ""underappreciated,"" but they're just properly appreciated by an understandably modest, devoted fanbase. Though their handsomely recorded albums and Jonathan Meiburg's former membership in Okkervil River put them in the context of NPR darlings and amphitheater headliners, they're still a tough sell: Often compared to Talk Talk at their most commercially forbidding, they're not populist like Okkervil or the National, their theatricality doesn't appeal to a specific brand of geekdom like the Decemberists or Andrew Bird, and their artiness is too pretty and studied to be edgy. Even when trying to describe what makes something like Rook's ""The Snow Leopard"" a staggering listen, you're left with chin-stroking explanations, like how a trumpet's fanfare finally breaks the tension of John Congleton's immaculate production, but it lasts three seconds and takes four minutes to get there. On Animal Joy too many changes are afoot to think Meiburg isn't chafed by the situation: They've peripherally moved from one indie titan (Matador) to another (Sub Pop) and from one revered indie producer (John Congleton) to another (Danny Reisch). But more notably, take a look at the unusually plainspoken title: Animal Joy proves they are still a naturalistically minded band, but in dropping the more arcane conceptual gambits of their self-described ""trilogy"" of Palo Santo, Rook, and The Golden Archipelago and speaking in layman's terms both emotionally and sonically, they're taking their best shot at meeting new listeners halfway. They come racing out of the gate to do so on ""Animal Life""-- Meiburg's amped-up choirboy vocals have always been suited for grand, sweeping gestures and yet he's never delivered something so overtly pop. To put it in his preferred orinthological terms, it's a peacock moment for sure, pure 1980s corporate rock because it somehow sounds expensive, striving to honor ambition itself as intrinsically good-- it could be a Florence and the Machine song, NBC could use it to soundtrack their commercials for the Summer Olympics, but they throw in enough fussy chord changes and dissonant fringe to keep things from getting too cozy.  There's a similar release-the-hounds rush to ""You As You Were"", a sonic and poetic ramble culminating in Meiburg's desire to ""Go back to the East/ Where it's all so civilized/ Where I was born to the life/ But I am leaving the life."" Whether it's meant as a candid admission from a touring musician or a nod to the desk jockey that longs to mount a wild steed, it feels like a mission statement; Animal Joy doesn't so much stand for carnality but for the thrill in upsetting the equilibrium between domesticated repression and desire for primitive abandon. While Animal Joy doesn't totally do away with Shearwater's exploratory tendencies, Ek's production is radio-friendly in the sense that there's a constant presence to this music-- even the comparatively quieter moments make themselves heard fairly easily. In the past, Shearwater songs occasionally got loud, but lead single ""Breaking the Yearlings"" is loud throughout, big churning guitars and busy, inventive percussion from the truly underappreciated Thor Harris. That said, it's still a Shearwater song in that you'll get more out of it if you happen to know that yearlings are essentially pubescent horses, energetic and unpredictable. Indeed, though considerably dialed-back, Meiburg hasn't lost his preference for poetic devices-- whether equine or otherwise-- to keep any attempts to present Shearwater as a red-blooded, blue-collar rock band short lived. Amidst the trudging orchestral strains of ""Insolence"", he announces rapture as a time ""when my thoughts become undisciplined... it is effortless,"" a wish-fulfillment fantasy for a band whose power is often the result of fairly obvious effort. And though Shearwater typically allow themselves one song per album to rock out of character, ""Century Eyes"" or ""Corridors"" wouldn't prepare you for how ""Immaculate"" gets all Eddie & the Cruisers with it, complete with tweaked 12-bar blues riffs, and a reckless loner named Johnny as a narrative device. Yet while being Shearwater's most accessible record by some margin, it isn't quite the best, and toward the record's back half, it begins to become clear why. Meiburg's inimitable vocals aside, this is the first batch of Shearwater songs that could conceivably be the work of another band, confirming what made Rook unique while hinting at their shortcomings previously unexpressed. While the streamlined ""Open Your Houses"" and ""Dread Sovereign"" ably replicate the rhythmically stoic but emotionally jittery mien of fellow Austinites Spoon, Meiburg's imperious vocals cut against a musical backdrop that calls for more strut or swagger. Likewise, the startlingly ordinary iPhone-waver ""Star of the Age"" closes Animal Joy by bringing Shearwater perilously towards to the sort of adult-contemporary indie wallpaper they've never been. These are minor quibbles, as even Meiburg admits that Animal Joy is something transitional for the band. And it's a welcome move-- The Golden Archipelago fell victim to the sort of indulgence and inscrutability that's to be expected from a concept album titled The Golden Archipelago, and the worry then was that Shearwater would be content to drift even further into their rococo fantasies without realizing they'd left the rest of us behind. Even if Animal Joy brings them closer to the mainland of pop and rock, it'll still take a lot to place these guys in the middle of the road, and after all, what's a more basic animal joy than to be appreciated?","Jonathan Meiburg and co.'s latest album finds Shearwater dropping the arcane conceptual gambits of their recent ""trilogy"" and speaking in layman's terms emotionally and sonically.

Arrow,Heartless Bastards,by: Stephen M.

Perhaps their name was too misleading or their lineup too precarious, but the Bastards escaped the mantle that's been assigned to everyone from the Strokes to the Black Keys and most recently to the Alabama Shakes. If that has left them out of enviable company, at least they've managed to attract a loyal audience and even star in a crucial ""Friday Night Lights"". Their first for Partisan Records, Arrow is their crunchiest album since Erika Wennerstrom gutted the original trio in 2008 and rebuilt the Bastards as a quartet. Largely discarding the fiddle, pedal steel, and banjo that fleshed out 2009's The Mountain, the band and producer Jim Eno of Spoon strip things down to emphasize guitars and the rhythm section as much as vocals. They open these songs up, both enabling a heavier sound and making room for some weighty jamming. The result is less fussy than The Mountain, with room enough for some Skynyrd Southern rock on ""Late in the Night"" and Santana percussion on ""Skin and Bone"". They've developed a larger musical vocabulary, but the results can be cumbersome: With timpani and crackling guitar right out of a Morricone soundtrack, the nearly seven-minute centerpiece ""The Arrow Killed the Beast"" is more melodramatic than dramatic, weighted down by import and exaggerated ambience. Perhaps the Bastards have begun courting the rock-revivalist constituency on Arrow. ""Whenever you need a pick-me-up, you gotta have gotta have rock'n'roll,"" Wennerstrom sings on ""Got to Have Rock and Roll"". Despite the dry classic-rock riff and chugging momentum, the song makes for a tepid endorsement. ""Skin and Bone"" is much less corny, as Wennerstrom sings, ""Oh, I want it to be like when I was young."" She may not be speaking specifically about rock'n'roll, but that line succinctly sums up listeners' evolving relationship with music and a desperate desire to connect as strongly as we did in our youth. Most of the Bastards songs address travel rather than age, which is how most touring bands interpret the write-what-you-know adage. ""Staring out at the city skyline, a marathon is going down the street,"" Wennerstrom sings on opener ""Marathon"". The song is about how life is a ""long race home,"" and dangling participle aside, it's an immensely awkward image to open the album. Wennerstrom has always been a fairly workmanlike songwriter, although her voice and her band compensate when words fail her. The lyrics on Arrow are best when they settle for serviceable instead of strive for profound, and the line that resonates with the most meaning is also the one of the simplest: ""Oh I got you on my mind,"" she sings throughout ""Late in the Night"", and the romantic implications become clearer and bolder with each repetition. It helps that the Bastards play loud and hard enough to nearly drown out her vocals, reveling in the musical as well as the sexual tension. That's arguably more rock'n'roll than another song about rock'n'roll.","The Erika Wennerstrom-fronted Cincinnati blues rock quartet (and Friday Night Lights favorites) strip things down on their crunchy Jim Eno-produced fourth album.

Les Voyages de l'Âme,Alcest,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3889d034d5c69bf4d14/1:1/w_160/afdbc6ed.jpeg,2012-02-15 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16289-les-voyages-de-lame/,Prophecy,"Since 1999, Stéphane Paut (aka Neige) has been composing sunny, shoegazing post-black metal under the Alcest moniker. Alcest's third LP, Les Voyages de l'Âme, feels like his ultimate statement on this particular approach. Paut, who first made his mark playing purer black metal, has been at Alcest longer than he contributed to the eccentric, raw, politically tricky black-metal crew Peste Noire. During Alcest's run, his dynamic genre-meshing post-punk black-metal quartet Amesoeurs came and went. While he'll likely continue working with German musician Herbst on the blackened post-rock band Lantlôs, he's not the one piloting that ship (ditto Forgotten Woods). That, and Old Silver Key, his collaboration with members of Drudkh, felt like a half-baked one-off. All to say, despite the insane list of associations and circles affixed to his name, the multi-tasking French multi-instrumentalist has been increasingly focused on this one higher profile, very personal project. The attention he's given Alcest has given him time to hone (and ramp up) the signature sound. Instead of shifting things, or looking for ways to expand the aesthetic, he's been trying to perfect something very specific. When I spoke to Neige about Alcest in 2007, he said the concept for the band was connected to ""visions"" he had as a child of ""an indescribably beautiful place where everything-- trees, glades, and brooks-- produces a pearly light and where a faraway and celestial music floats in the air like a perfume."" The songs recorded under the Alcest name are ""the musical testimony of these experiences."" It's a fairy or dream land that he's trying to recreate sonically, and each record apparently clarifies and better maps something that's been in his head for a long time. So, while the dogged reliance on a particular formula is essential to the project, it's problematic if you're looking for variation. It shouldn't be a surprise that Les Voyages, translated ""The Journeys of the Soul,"" is the most accomplished Alcest offering. That's the way things have been going for a while. (Per usual, Paut handles everything but the drums, again tackled again by ex-Amesoeurs/Peste Noire player Winterhalter of Les Discrets, and ex-Alcest/Amesoeurs guitarist Fursy Teyssier, also of Les Discrets, did the artwork.) Part of Alcest's charm, though, has been the project's imperfections: The haze of the 2005 two-song, Charles Baudelaire-cribbing debut Le Secret-- its abrupt shifts between nature recordings, clean dream-pop acoustics, and raw black metal-- was transfixing and, despite all the beauty, strange. Seven years later he's clarified and crystallized that approach, sure, and lost something in that translation. (It's hard to go back into the shadows once you've left them.) In one sense, it is a return to form. 2010's Écailles de Lune took on a darker cast. It was a fine record, but Alcest sound best when he's chasing after sunspots. You do get plenty of that here, along with the usual smeary French singing and pretty shoegaze sentimentality. The standout moment, I think, is the transition from the more frantic ""Beings of Light""-- a soaring, angelic blur that opens with a kind of airy choir-- to the almost eight-minute ""Faiseurs de Mondes"", a track that makes use of the group's heavier tendencies (plenty of black-metal howls) alongside a catchier pop riff and a very dense melodicism. In ""Beings of Light"", it's unclear if he's saying anything or just holding notes, and it doesn't really matter. When Alcest made their New York City premiere a couple of years ago-- a show I helped organize-- Paut had lost his voice, so he handed over his vocal duties to someone else in the band, touring guitarist Zero. Paut, in turn, stood in the background. It felt natural to me; he's not really a frontman. Here, when everything's as clear as it is on Les Voyages de l'Âme, he feels almost too exposed, and the big climaxes he's reaching for don't arrive. There's no denying the beauty, but it feels weirdly muted-- or perhaps just unsurprising. Paut doesn't write pop songs memorable enough to exist entirely as pop, and at this point enough people are blending black metal with a variety of softer genres that those explosions don't send shivers like they did in the past. Surprise is essential to his plan. Now, instead of straddling and bridging two genres in unique ways, it feels as if he's treading water in both.","The French metal veteran blends shoegaze sentimentality with black-metal aesthetics on his latest LP, the most accomplished Alcest offering yet.

Lixiviation,Suzanne Ciani,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3825e6ef95969322483/1:1/w_160/414099d5.jpeg,2012-02-15 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16284-lixiviation/,Finders KeepersB-Music,"The music of electronic composer Suzanne Ciani has quietly crept into many people's lives at some point. Her work effortlessly bridges the realms of the commercial and the avant garde, barely recognizing the distinction between the two. Ciani is a classically trained composer who studied with computer music trailblazer Max Mathews and worked with Don Buchla, the latter being the inventor of a frequently used tool in her musical armory, the Buchla 200 synthesizer. In the early 1970s she formed Ciani Musica, Inc. in New York, through which she produced soundtrack work for commercials by Merrill-Lynch, Clairol, Skittles, and GE among others (go here for some examples). Ciani's sound-effects work on Meco's platinum-selling disco version of the Star Wars soundtrack brought her unannounced to a wider audience, while her own career has positioned her as a proto-synth guru, a doyen of the new age musical movement, and, in more recent times, a noted classical musician. Anyone looking for an entry point into Ciani's elastic career will be well served by Lixiviation, a compilation spanning 1968-85 from the always intriguing B-Music label. Here, the vaults of Ciani Musica have been plundered, with her peppy compositions for companies including PBS, Atari, and Coca-Cola documented, alongside ahead-of-their-time electronic pieces that hint at her later drift into new age. It's a perfect introduction to the far-reaching nature of her talents, but it's also useful for illustrating how music notionally thought to be ""underground"" often happily floats into family homes every evening. Through her commercial work, Ciani was prying open a door that led to unlikely collaborations further down the line, including Aphex Twin's work with Pirelli and music lent to a jeans ad by Sunn O))). In the sleeve notes, she indicates how her commercial work helped fund her creative pursuits-- another harbinger of how the music industry would ultimately evolve. What binds Ciani's eclectic pieces on this album is the lucidity of her vision, which is emphasized further in those comprehensive sleeve notes. She talks of never using the word synthesizer (""it had strange and inappropriate connotations""), of spending ""weeks just living with the machine, always on,"" when using her Buchla. It's not hard to romanticize her existence back then, buried under a deluge of wires and circuitry. This is a whole world she created, where brightly blinking synth noise flowed into fracturing swells of bass (""Lixiviation""), where a piece created as a choreography (""Princess with Orange Feet"") sounded like great bursts of light collapsing into one another. The closing ""Second Breath"", recorded during Ciani's time at UC Berkeley circa 1968-70, is a precursor to the harsher, ever-repeating drones krautrock legends Cluster would appropriate as their central stylistic thrust a few years later. It's easy to hear the hallmarks of that darker sound in some of Ciani's commercial work-- the ""Clean Room"" ITT TV spot has the same kind of density as John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 score, with sturdy prods of bass synth and a sparse, ricocheting beat providing the grounding for her to layer sunnier parts over the top. But Ciani was also enamored with the playful side of the instruments at her disposal. On the dainty clicks and whirrs of ""Sound of a Dream Kissing"", there are traces of the frivolous zing of Pierre Henry's classic ""Psyché Rock"". Her work for Atari and Coca-Cola are similarly buoyant, with the four seconds of bubbles, pop, and fizz she created for Coke forming a delightful piece of fluffy, synthesized mimicry. It's telling that Ciani's music was deemed suitable for commercials and TV spots all over the world just as the public was getting to grips with a possible forthcoming computer age. Not just because of the obvious sci-fi components, but also because it bears a perfect blend of urgency, anxiety, and technological utopianism, straddling contrasting feelings of slack-jawed optimism about the future and all the Cold War-era jitters prevalent at the time. Her work for the PBS show ""Inside Story"" sounds like a dramatic precursor to receiving an impossibly bleak news update on our impending armageddon, while her corporate tag for Atari rushes assuredly into the future, embracing all the innovation around it. That ability to flit back and forth between styles and feelings no doubt made Ciani an attractive client to her corporate employers. But Lixiviation also goes some way to forming links between her disparate worlds, showing off more reflective work through what she describes as her ""very feminine"" synthesized waveforms, and demonstrating how such material bled through to the mainstream in unexpected ways.","The work of classically trained electronic composer Suzanne Ciani effortlessly bridges the commercial and the avant garde. This compilation, spanning 1968-1985, is a perfect introduction to the far-reaching nature of her talents.

A Sleep & a Forgetting,Islands,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3855e6ef95969322489/1:1/w_160/2d60bb4c.jpeg,2012-02-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16287-a-sleep-a-forgetting/,Anti-,"Who is Nick Thorburn? Up to this point, it's been hard to tell. As figurehead for the six-years-strong Islands, he's been an artistic vagrant, switching from strummy, beached Graceland-isms, to avant-rap experiments, to overblown indie pomp, to squishy, Auto-Tuned synth-pop-- sometimes, within the same record. Side projects like Human Highway and Mister Heavenly have gone great lengths to mine his appreciation for the garage pop of the 1950s and 60s, but have revealed relatively little; last year's pay-what-you-want solo album under his Nick Diamonds alias, I Am an Attic, was a cleaning-house collection that didn't provide much help either. Even the album that was responsible for Thorburn's rise to mid-level recognition, the Unicorns' 2003 effort Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?, provides few clues (no pun intended)-- both because he hasn't produced that brand of ecstatically demented indie rock since, and because the band imploded a year after the album's release. Thorburn's relative artistic facelessness is made more complicated by the fact that Islands is, essentially, a solo project itself; since the 2006 debut, Return to the Sea, no Islands record has featured the same personnel, with former Unicorns member Jaime Thompson leaving the band previous to 2008's Arm's Way and returning for the following year's pop-fixated Vapours. For Islands' latest, A Sleep & a Forgetting, the lineup's changed again, with Thompson departing shortly after the last record was released. Claiming that this record is different from its predecessor is something of a folly in itself-- every Islands record is a change-up from the one previous, almost to a fault-- but regardless, it feels like a curtain's been pulled back for the first time. It's the most cohesive-- and, possibly, the out-and-out strongest-- Islands record yet, one that retains a singular focus while zooming in on an artist who's preferred to remain at a distance, obscured by so many stylistic gambits, for so long. Ironically, the renewed passion existent in A Sleep & a Forgetting can be credited to a loss of passion in Thorburn's personal life. In a recent interview with Vulture, he revealed that the album's creation was spurred on by a bad breakup and subsequent self-exile to ""a friend of a friend's"" place in Los Angeles, where he largely wrote the record's songs on piano. Thorburn's described A Sleep & a Forgetting as ""confessional,"" and it indeed finds him at his most lyrically direct and naked, whether it be the open-ended questions asked to no one on the album's beautifully burnt-out penultimate track, ""Don't I Love You"", or the opening couplet on ""Can't Feel My Face"", which pretty much spells it out for you: ""I miss my wife/ I miss my best friend."" Confessional intimacy needs an intimate setting to match, so the behind-the-boards inclusion of Rob Schnapf, who co-produced a large amount of Elliott Smith's discography, was an inspired choice. Schnapf keeps things as unfussy as possible, which is fitting since A Sleep & a Forgetting is a particularly unfussy album of capital-S ""songs."" As with Human Highway and Mister Heavenly, Thorburn's still drawing from garage-pop and singer/songwriter sounds of yester-yesteryear, but save for a few minor flourishes here and there-- the chilled-veins AOR pop of ""This Is Not a Song"", a ""96 Tears""-worthy lick of dirty organ that writhes through ""Can't Feel My Face""-- there's nothing that distracts from the songwriting, which is unarguably as strong as it's been since the Nick Diamonds' days as a Unicorn. A Sleep & a Forgetting is a small album, both by design and in its impact; there are no grand statements made, musical or otherwise, and since this is, really, 37 minutes of no-frills, room-temperature indie pop proper, it's incredibly easy to let this record get lost in the breeze. This isn't a bad thing, though-- in fact, it's something of a triumph for Thorburn, to match his most emotionally devastating material yet with music that's so close-sounding and unassumingly, unabashedly pretty. There's humanity in these songs, a quality that was muddled in the noise of Arm's Way and Return to the Sea, and sidelined during Human Highway and Mister Heavenly's genre excursions (however pleasurable they might have been). When Jaime Thompson left Islands for the first time, Thorburn memorably and amicably proclaimed, ""Islands are forever."" Maybe a repurposed album title from his old band would work better this time around: Islands are people too.","Spurred on by a bad breakup, Nick Thorburn showcases a renewed passion on this Rob Schnapf-mixed collection, the most cohesive Islands record to date.

Kindred EP,Burial,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38b9d034d5c69bf4d1a/1:1/w_160/18830032.jpg,2012-02-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16292-kindred/,Hyperdub,"When last year's Street Halo came out, it was met with the same breathless hysteria that has greeted every new morsel of Burial music since Untrue. But you couldn't help but feel that the ghostly two-step master had become a little predictable. Even as the producer experimented with house music on the title track (which he had done previously on ""Raver"" and ""Versus""), it felt as if he were re-using the same sounds and effects. A year later, and with still no sign of a third album, we're treated to another three-track EP. But unlike Street Halo, Kindred, currently available digitally only, breaks nearly every Burial precedent there is, from the 12-minute-long tracks to an new sound design that feels consummately richer than the genius of his earlier work. Of the three, ""Kindred"" (12-minute symphony No. 1) will be the most recognizable to Burial die-hards, featuring that same clanking metal-on-metal garage skip-and-swing. But this time something just feels heavier, harder, more devastating. Burial's been credited since the beginning as a prophet tying together UK genres old and new, but there's never been a better argument than ""Kindred"", which hints at the agility of jungle with the lead-footed heft of dubstep as seen through elliptical garage beats. They tumble and timestretch like vintage Metalheadz underneath smouldering Reese basslines, and the vocals lack Burial's usual phrases, instead choking out syllables smothered by the aural ash and soot that seems to soak the recording in a humongous, unearthly rumbling. As a whole ""Kindred"" sounds bigger than anything he's done before, an infinitely detailed behemoth that lumbers and shakes the ground beneath it with every little stroke of movement. ""Kindred"" is basically a suite in itself, a new kind of tumult that only heightens Burial's usual wrenching sorrow, an ambitious new venture repeated in Kindred's other two tracks. ""Loner"" outdoes the sad-sack ecstacy of Untrue's similarly housey ""Raver""-- for one thing, it's a lot faster-- but it's coated in MDMA residue, its chugging kick-and-snare pattern and almost prog-house pumping chord progression drowning in gloss. That chemical energy lends its fatalism an almost heroic sense of momentum, moving and moving and never quite getting anywhere but into the same empty, desperate silence that swallowed ""Kindred"". It's a well-timed track, navigating the same obsession with house and techno that's gripping the entire bass music world and turning it into something distinctly Burial, perverting house's speedy metronome (and prog house's politics of bliss) into profound, otherworldly sadness. But as impressive as those two tracks are, there's no real way to prepare for ""Ashtray Wasp"", also built on a broken house lope. This time it's overloaded with funereal synths and arpeggios that twirl frantically in anguish as if they had nowhere else to go, saturating the cloudy soundscape with particulate matter so intricate it's a wonder all this sound data can be contained in a single mp3, nevermind a groove in wax. The fluttering effects are only further confused by the bleary smudge of it all, cinematic and grand but stuck in Burial's world of canned frequencies: The locust-swarm effect of the filters is impossibly stirring, far more visceral than perfect clarity ever could have been. It falls apart about seven minutes in before reconstructing into an even more decayed beat, violently wedged apart by static-- recalling the most challenging work of the Caretaker and his vinyl experiments. ""Ashtray Wasp"" suggests a structural intricacy and awe-inspiring execution from one of electronic music's mopiest producers, and the result might be his definitive track. It's hard to talk about Kindred-- whether in the context of electronic dance music or just in the Burial discography itself-- without resorting to superlative terms, because it really is just that impressive. It's easy enough to take a talent such as Burial for granted, but Kindred is like a convenient slap in the face, a wake up call. Never before has his music possessed this much majesty, this much command, this much power: The pathos here has moved from sympathetic to completely domineering. The amount of dialog around Burial can be a little hard to swallow sometimes, especially when the guy himself seems so resistant-- or at least indifferent-- to the ongoing intellectualization of his music. But what we get on Kindred isn't some loner unknowingly making genius out of samples from Metal Gear Solid on his Playstation. You might not think of refinement when you think of Burial's productions, but just try to imagine it, and you'll get an idea of the kind of glory that Kindred carries. It still might not be the follow-up to Untrue that everyone's been waiting for, but format feels completely irrelevant. When those beats fall into place on the title track, nothing else matters for the next 30 minutes, until the crackle and fizz of ""Ashtray Wasps"" finally fades away. Then you put it on again. And again. And again.","A year after Street Halo, the London producer returns with another three-track EP, and this collection pretty much breaks every Burial precedent there is.

Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid to Ask,Sea Lions,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37e5e6ef9596932247e/1:1/w_160/aff7cbda.jpeg,2012-02-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16282-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-sea-lions-but-were-afraid-to-ask/,Slumberland,"Out of all the post-millennial bands that have largely benefited from the C86 tape's renewed interest, Sea Lions are one of the few who actually sound like they were pulled directly from the compilation rather than a band adopting a vogue influence. The treble-heavy production is parallel to that of first-wave twee-punk. The guitars go way past indie pop's minimum quota for jangle. It's quite feasible that if you played Sea Lions for someone who wasn't aware the album was released near the end of 2011, they'd assume that they were a super-obscure band from the early or mid 1980s. There's a stigma that comes along with having a style that represents a very specific time period, a school of thought that says anything thoroughly nailing a past era is regressive and harmful to the forward movement of music. But those influences had to come from somewhere, so why not cut out the middleman and go straight to the source? Especially if you can find a way to infuse it with your own personality. In that sense, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid to Ask makes for a boilerplate, but immensely satisfying, noise-pop record. Dissonant and angular instrumentals are scattered throughout, giving the album a light experimental edge. Major-key romps are punctuated with glockenspiel, woozy tremolo bar work, and noisy guitar chicken-scratch. The ballads shuffle like 1960s R&B classics. Frontman Adrian Pillado is a songwriter who closely adheres to the sensibilities of DIY twee. He has a playful and unsophisticated baritone that suggests either a less dour Ian Curtis or a more English Calvin Johnson. His lyrics focus on the awkwardness of young relationships, the allure of childhood, and burrowing his head underneath as many blankets and pillows as he can find. Sometimes he gets so caught up in his own neuroses that his voice trails off-key, but it's never in a way that feels like self-pity or melodrama. Pillado is charming and full enough of character to make his songs consistently entertaining, a trait he shares with the frontmen of all his influences, from the obvious ones (like Beat Happening and Orange Juice) to the less expected (like Crass). Part of Everything's success is that it follows the time-honored indie pop tradition of being short and sweet. Brevity and brisk pacing are characteristics the band seems quite familiar with: They manage to cram 15 tracks into a time frame of 29 minutes, with only three of the album's songs passing the 2:30 mark and none that even grazes three minutes. In fact, a few of the shorter tunes grind to a halt at completely unexpected endpoints, which is a jarring but effective way to get a listener's attention. The way these songs end doesn't make them sound unfinished in any way, but it's apparent that the band would rather not coast on a good riff or melody long enough to lose its luster. Almost any band could take only the basic elements of indie pop and make a listenable album. Many, many bands already have. What makes Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid to Ask above-average is the band that made it, one willing to adjust its sound so it's slightly off-center, reverent of the past but not to the point where it completely hinders their ability to push things forward.","On their satisfying debut LP, this C86-nodding California noise-pop quintet mixes the familiar with the unexpected.

We Are the Works in Progress,Various Artists,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b384ea9e61561daa6ae3/1:1/w_160/1ebffc10.jpeg,2012-02-14 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16286-we-are-the-works-in-progress/,Asa Wa Kuru,"Blonde Redhead singer Kazu Makino is from Kyoto, Japan, a few hours' drive from where a 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami caused toxic meltdowns at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. Though rebuilding efforts have been extensive, the effects of the disaster continue a year later, and in many cases the people of Japan still have no way of knowing if their food has been contaminated by radiation. This compilation, bringing together unreleased tracks from friends and likeminded musicians such as Deerhunter, Four Tet, and Terry Riley, is Makino's attempt to raise money and support for ongoing relief work in Japan. Charity records are a tricky thing, since it can be difficult to make a group of artists' songs hang together like a traditional album. Some of the most notable examples (1993's No Alternative, 2009's Dark Was the Night) got around this by using kind of a mixtape format, offering stylistically varied songs from loosely related bands buffet-style. We Are the Works in Progress, though, takes more of an AOR approach. Each of the cuts here are similar in pace (slow) and coloring (gray), and there's a somber, almost funereal quality that ties them all together. For example, Blonde Redhead's reworked ""Penny Sparkle"" is such a natural transition from John Roberts' ""Berceuse"" that you could mistake them for the same musician. That cohesiveness goes a long way, but sometimes gets misspent on material that's a little on the weak side. There are some big names here, artists we expect to deliver on a consistent basis, but unfortunately they don’t give away their prime stuff. A good example is the Deerhunter contribution ""Curve"", a slow-building ambient rock piece that is perfectly pleasant-sounding but lacks the danger and emotional rawness that marks the band's best work. This is to be expected on a compilation like this, really, and Makino says as much in the liner notes but flips it as a positive. ""Many of these tracks are works in progress, hence the name... Unfinished things often carry more energy."" That's true in certain spots. The best tracks here have a sketchy, rough-hewn quality that suggests an artist stumbling onto something promising. Pantha du Prince's ""Bird on a Wire"" sounds like a precursor to his breakout Black Noise material, teasing the combination of grit and airiness that made that album so compelling. Most of Works is not as strong, existing primarily in B-side territory, but there is something thematically satisfying about its looseness. Here's a record dedicated to a place that was wrecked and is trying to rebuild. The devastated parts of Japan won't resurrect in a day; it's a slow process of gray areas and false starts and moments of promise. That's how this music feels.","Featuring unreleased tracks from Deerhunter, Four Tet, and Terry Riley, among others, this compilation organized by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino benefits relief work in Japan for the 2011 meltdowns at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant.

White Flame,Lil B,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b389ea9e61561daa6aea/1:1/w_160/d60234f6.jpeg,2012-02-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16290-white-flame/,self-released,"Not only is Lil B an incredible producer of rap music, he's also an incredible consumer of rap music. Over the past three years, he's arguably invented his own microgenre with ""based music,"" but a good number of the hundreds of songs he's released in that time are open love letters to other rap artists or regional sounds, from OJ Da Juiceman to Cormega. Any borderline insomniac can sometimes find B on Twitter when night bleeds into morning, tweeting furiously and enthusiastically about rappers such as the 504 Boyz, who have long been out of the spotlight, if they ever were in the first place. White Flame is B's latest entry into his Flame series, an ongoing string of mixtapes that can be all over the place musically but often delve into the sounds and slang of classic New Orleans rap, right down to the covers, which are spot-on tributes to 1990s Pen & Pixel collages. They've also featured B close to his most unchained, which has led to songs that are fascinating, bizarre, and fantastic as well as ideas that are so unbelievably bad that they can come from only one person. On all fronts, White Flame doesn't disappoint. There are tracks-- some hyper-lucid and some decidedly absurdist-- that will likely be some of the best songs that Lil B puts out this year. There is also a ridiculous near-diss track aimed at the Game, a song that liberally samples ""I Would Die 4 U"" and another called ""BasedGod Fucked My Bitches"" that throws a preposterously mismatched drum loop under a generous sample of Daft Punk's ""One More Time"" for six and a half minutes. Predictably it's a pick-and-pull record, but those willing to sift can find plenty of reminders of why B is, if not vital, then at least still enduring. Like most tapes in the Flame series, White Flame peaks when B is at his most wild. Here he often reverts back to the wild-eyed gangster, pseudo-gender-bending persona he developed on last year's Bitch Mob tape, resulting in hilarious and extremely singular tracks such as ""Bitch of the City"", ""I'm Fabio"", and ""Poppin V"" that blur the line between rapping and rambling and in many ways challenge what the art form is designed to do. The songs are purposefully funny and, like plenty of rap music, trade as much on charisma and the ability to coin catchphrases as anything, but they also beg the question of why exactly we need Lil B doing his most sincere B.G. impersonation while bragging for an entire track about taking ""grandpa pills"" in the first place. Well, maybe we don't, but it's hard to listen to tracks like those-- balanced with more traditional songs like ""Surrender to Me"" and ""Neva Switch""-- and not feel an affinity for what Lil B is pulling off. His subversion of the conventions of the genre remains strong even as he becomes further assimilated into the mainstream, but more importantly he's coming from a place of love and reverence with regard to the music that he's twisting. There is no artifice or endgame, just a weird dude having fun with the music he-- and plenty of others-- grew up listening to. The best of White Flame won't convince those already turned off by Lil B, and some of it is outright useless, but the tape illustrates that he's still operating at a high level. The next few Lil B tapes are already just a keystroke away, but White Flame has songs to come back to, both for pure entertainment and if you ever find yourself wondering just how exactly the guy who raps, ""I can't believe it's not butter/ I'm Fabio,"" can keep pumping out so much unique, good music.","The latest entry in Lil B's Flame series-- mixtapes that can be all over the place, but often delve into the sounds and slang of classic New Orleans rap-- does not disappoint in its blend of the bizarre, fantastic, and unbelievably bad.

Biokinetics,Porter Ricks,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b386ea9e61561daa6ae7/1:1/w_160/5d2858ab.jpeg,2012-02-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16288-biokinetics/,Type,"If you bought Porter Ricks' Biokinetics on CD in the 1990s and the disc is still intact, consider yourself lucky: The original edition is currently trading for $65 and up on Discogs. The price has something to do with the album's place in history: Biokinetics, a touchstone of experimental techno, was the first album released on Berlin's widely worshipped Chain Reaction label. But scarcity is a bigger factor: Biokinetics, like all of Chain Reaction's CDs from that era, came packaged in an aluminum tin that tended to crack the CD it was supposed to be protecting. (As a comment on Discogs notes, ""Another Chain Reaction release, another metal box that eats up CDs."") Fortunately, 16 years later, John Twells' Massachusetts-based Type label has stepped up with a reissue of the landmark album, not just on CD (this time in a standard jewel case) but also, for the first time, on 2xLP and digital download. It's a welcome reissue, and long overdue. It comes as certain ideas from techno's fertile, experimental, mid-1990s period are being picked up by a range of underground musicians. Many of these ideas have permeated so deeply into the culture that it's hard to remember a time without them, but we wouldn't have Burial, to name just one of the duo's distant descendants, without Porter Ricks' seafloor crackle and mottled-granite color scale. Porter Ricks were the duo of Thomas Köner, a sound artist and ambient composer, and Andy Mellwig, a techno producer who also recorded as Continuous Mode and, with former Monolake member and future Ableton founder Gerhard Behles, as Async Sense. Released in 1996, Biokinetics was Porter Ricks' debut album, gathering tracks from three vinyl EPs released that year along with three songs exclusive to the album. It had been years since I last listened to it, and the Type reissue surprised me first by reminding me how diverse the album is. ""Chain Reaction"" has long since become shorthand for a certain fusion of buoyant dub, hazy ambience, and coiled techno, but on Biokinetics, none of these has quite settled into place; it's a dynamic, unpredictable mixture of pulse and hiss. The opening ""Port Gentil"", a precursor to the template Wolfgang Voigt would adopt under his Gas alias, pairs soft, monochromatic tones with a muted 4/4 pulse. On the surface, it couldn't be simpler, but as it pulls you in, you become aware of shifting contours and unusual dimensions, the interplay of light and shadow; it sounds like a string section tuning up atop a freight train trundling through a deep canyon. ""Nautical Dub"" hews closer to textbook techno, with muscular bass pushing relentlessly forward, but it's hardly conventional. There are no sharp edges, for one thing: Percussive accents have been buffed to a dull gleam, and the upper register of the track, normally reserved for crisp, cutting hi-hats, is diffused into a fine-gauge spray that sweeps back and forth like a lawn sprinkler. Only ""Port of Call"" assumes dancefloor techno's chiseled boom-tick profile, but this time it's the low end that's fizzed to near nothingness. A few years later, Pole would famously construct an entire aesthetic around the vagaries of a broken Waldorf filter, but Biokinetics was first: Everything sounds broken here, all frayed cables and dusty contacts, and every gesture toward techno clarity feels like a trade-off made at the expense of another element that's left to crumble. Dub techno has since become one of electronic music's most mannered styles, but here, Porter Ricks' tracks feel not so much like compositions, much less stylistic exercises, than answers to very specific, fairly arcane questions-- what happens when we route this LFO through that filter? How many divisions can we parse between the downbeats? How can chaos be turned into rhythm, and how far can a repetition be stretched before it's rendered senseless? Where is the boundary between tone and white noise? On ""Biokinetics 1"", a heaving, wheezing synthesizer struggles to stick to a regular pulse as it's fed through disorienting delay and looped back upon itself, stumbling and confused. As an experiment in stretching a groove to the breaking point, it's as exhilarating as anything in the history of techno. ""Port of Nuba"" and ""Nautical Nuba"" submit drum machines to a similar warping process, resulting in rhythms that gallop like teams of horses. Here, you can hear the origin of Thomas Brinkmann's tumbling cadences of a year or two later, as he used a double-armed turntable to draw elliptical rhythms out of the grooves of records by Wolfgang Voigt and Richie Hawtin. And while we're talking about precedents, the leaden dirge of ""Biokinetics 2"" lays the groundwork for the bleak, trudging techno of Andy Stott and his Modern Love labelmates. That Biokinetics is an album about currents is reflected in its seafaring titles, such as ""Nautical Dub"", ""Nautical Zone"", ""Port of Call"", etc., and also in the way that the record's energies feed back into itself. What Porter Ricks learned from dub was less about particular rhythms or stylistic tropes than about the path that a sound travels as it wends its way through the mixing desk, and how it comes out transformed on the other side. Dub's hall-of-mirrors approach to versioning, meanwhile, informs the way that many tracks here are variations upon one another: ""Port Gentil"" and ""Nautical Zone"" bookend the album with nearly identical chords, while ""Nautical Nuba"" and ""Port of Nuba"" recycle the same drum patterns, using filters and delays to achieve very different results. Spontaneity is woven into the fiber of every track; it's easy to hear how some of them may have begun with the same sounds and patterns before the musicians' hands worked their magic on the filters, EQ, and delay, rendering each take unique and unrepeatable. Like Detroit's Drexciya, Porter Ricks (who took their name from a character from Flipper, the 1960s film and television series) used aquatic metaphors to get at larger ideas, both musical and otherwise. Ocean currents, electrical currents, sound waves, feedback; dub, techno, minimalism, noise; exchange as a fluid back-and-forth but also, as Drexciya pointed out, as a loaded dynamic, fraught, unequal-- they all swirl together, rippling in time and veering out of sync, as though pulled by complicated gravitational forces. Biokinetics is above all a music of tides, suggesting rhythm as both celestial stroke and as a vibration deep in the body, bubbling at the molecular level.","Biokinetics was the first album released on Berlin's Chain Reaction and 16 years later, Type has reissued Thomas Köner and Andy Mellwig's landmark experimental techno album.

"Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light II",Earth,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3805e6ef95969322481/1:1/w_160/dac0361c.jpeg,2012-02-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16283-angels-of-darkness-demons-of-light-ii/,Southern Lord,"Aside from founder Dylan Carlson, drummer Adrienne Davies is the only member of Earth to play on each of the four studio albums the drone-metal syndicate has made since re-forming seven years ago as an elegant blues band. On last year's Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light 1, she added an immediate, omnipresent grace. She swung softly during opener ""Old Black"", commanding the music's slow shifts with a righteous thump. And she carefully triggered album apex ""Descent to the Zenith"" with a light-footed march that served as the swivel for the rest of the band's melodic swoops. For all the deserved talk of Carlson's refinement and control as a guitarist, Davies was arguably his superior, guiding the quartet along with an unspoken, perfect resolve. Without her steady presence, one assumed, all of those light tones and slight menace might wash into blur, like watercolors escaping a drain. It's surprising if not discomfiting, then, that the second volume of Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light opens mostly without Davies. For the first 12 minutes, she resigns to almost auxiliary roles. On opener ""Sigil of Brass"", Carlson explores elliptical snippets of a short guitar progression, a leader advancing with caution. Cellist Lori Goldston and bassist Karl Blau pick up his patterns, stretching the same sounds above and beneath his picking with long exhalations. But Davies plays only her cymbal, and barely, adding occasional clatters that seem mostly like reminders that she's still behind the kit. She's even less present on ""His Teeth Did Brightly Shine"", the sort of slow, shimmering strut that she's motored with Earth for the better part of a decade. Instead, Blau mostly thumbs the beat with his bass as Carlson teases out guitar-effects flotsam beneath the sidewinding lead line. Davies merely offers bits of shakers and shells, her percussion becoming an occasional footnote to its normal narrative thread. Somehow, though, these tracks and their themes don't wash away or turn into seismic smears that would have suited Earth back when ""Kurt Kobain"" was offering up guest vocals. Recorded during the same sessions that yielded volume one of this series, they show the strong skeleton, sans distraction. More importantly, they confirm the suspicion that the crew Carlson gathered for the Angels of Darkness recordings is the most sympathetic, versatile, and unselfish group he's ever had. Without Davies, these first 12 minutes are some of the most muted in Earth's catalog, showcasing a band comfortable not only with its quiet but also with how a listener can hear clearly from one side of the mix to the other (compared especially to the impenetrable stuff of two decades ago). This is the epitome of cool, quiet confidence. But it isn't lopsided growth, as Angels II isn't simply the softer side of its predecessor. ""The Corascene Dog"" is gentle but glinting, with Carlson and Goldston trading sinister dialogue between their strings. And despite its classically suggestive title, ""Waltz (A Multiplicity of Doors)"" is actually one of the most abrasive looks yet at Earth 2.0. Goldston wrenches astringent wails from her cello, while Davies trades her generally quiet thunder for a heavier foot and a relentless tide of cymbals. Blau lets every note linger with a little extra emphasis, and Carlson tucks a web of foreboding guitar effects beneath the serrated guitar line. Earth saves the most revelatory moment for last. ""The Rakehell"" generously infuses funk, with Davies' syncopated trot serving as the structure beneath a lysergic smear. Carlson plays bass, using the low notes mostly to state the melody so that his guitar can push beyond it. He refracts, multiplies, and manipulates the tone, using the guitar to find the midpoint between a Meters organ and a wailing, heavy-metal lead. In an unlikely move in a career full of them, Earth add much younger bands like Sun Araw and Eternal Tapestry to their list of contemporaries. Indeed, for all the talk about this still-nascent phase of Earth versus that earlier frame-shifting phase, the twin Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light releases actually reveal a band with interests broader than such a binary might suggest. Earth aren't simply softening and separating their drone metal as if by centrifuge, or trying to be stately rather than beastly. These tracks are built on the brethren of blues, rock, and metal, but they wouldn't be compelling without pieces of bop buoyancy, minimalist restraint, classical consonance, and near-liturgical resolve. Oh, and believe it or not, funk. This version of Earth has simply given Carlson more room and more assistance to explore, well, darkness and light-- in his own time, of course.","The drone-metal syndicate, who reformed as an elegant blues band seven years ago, follow Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light 1 with an expansive, understated collection recorded during the same session as that 2011 album.

"""Evidence"" 12""",Carlos Giffoni,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b377c0084474cd0c2120/1:1/w_160/affaf44d.jpeg,2012-02-13 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16276-evidence/,Mexican SummerSoftware,"In Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton's Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, the authors point out how the earliest acid-house tracks produced in Chicago in the late 1980s had more ties with the avant-garde than with the house sound that was getting Top 40 attention in certain parts of the globe. Listening back to Phuture's epic ""Acid Tracks"" outside of a club environment can push you into a cold, harsh, solitary state of mind. It's not quite the sound of dance music retreating from its inclusionary vibe, as packed dancefloors spread out over innumerable acid revivals can testify. But early acid tracks like Lil' Louis' ""Video Clash"" and Armando's ""Downfall"" point inward more than they do outward, accelerating away from the hands-in-the-air solidarity of club culture and into a far more isolated space. Most of the acid revivals over the years have disengaged from that side of the genre-- Fatboy Slim and the big beat movement of the mid-to-late 1990s took all the slippery twists of the Roland TB-303 and funneled them into happier, stadium-filling anthems. But lately there's been a small band of musicians picking up on the raw, untrammeled nihilism of the earliest acid house tracks, singling out the sheer brute force of its core components and fusing them with outside influences. Factory Floor are the most high profile among them, single-handedly creating their own new acid underground with additional nods to pop, industrial, and the clear-lines aesthetic of their partial namesakes, Factory Records. In New York, the Venezuelan electronic musician Carlos Giffoni, mostly known for his excursions into noise, has spent the last few years digging into a similar set of influences. His No Fun Acid project, named by mashing up components of his No Fun festival and record label with his obvious debt to the sound of DJ Pierre and his cohorts, was flooded with tinny pitter-patter drum patterns and the burbling screeches of a thoroughly agitated 303. On ""Evidence"", a two-song 12"" for Ford & Lopatin's Software label, Giffoni takes the next logical step in the evolution of that sound, imprinting more of his personality on the work by cloaking it in the nebulous textures of his prior output. In a recent installment of the Out Door, Marc Masters highlighted how a number of mainstays in the noise scene have retreated from all-out sonic assault, turning to quieter corners for inspiration. ""Evidence"" ties into that trend, beginning with a simple piano and vocal piece that mirrors the feeling his label boss, Daniel Lopatin, as Oneohtrix Point Never, conjured up with Antony on ""Returnal"" in 2010. From there, Giffoni coats the track in an inflexible block of acidic sound and his detached, colorless vocal, creating a jarring juxtaposition between delivery and verse (""it would be so easy to fall in love with you""). It's sparse and unrelentingly downbeat, with a few cracks of light hacked into the murk by guest player Laurel Halo, credited with ""manually mechanized piano and synth riffage."" The other track here, ""Desire in the Summer"", is similarly drained of emotion, sounding like the slashed-up noise passages from Giffoni's Arrogance slowly sinking into battle with his new acid impulses. Again, his bone-dry delivery percolates throughout, positioning him as a survivor standing in the rubble as two genres go to war around him. This is a departure for Giffoni, even from the more club-friendly No Fun Acid project. But it feels like a natural space for him to land in, a way to align the abandon of his noise projects with the avant side of club culture that has obviously inspired him. ""Change is good,"" Giffoni said, in a 2010 interview with the Quietus. On ""Evidence"", that desire for change has thrown key restraints on his sound, galvanizing him to create his most unique and bullish musical statement to date.","This EP for Ford & Lopatin's Software label finds Carlos Giffoni fusing the noise textures of his earlier experiments to acid house with intriguing results.

Plumb,Field Music,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b379b1335d7bf169a5d2/1:1/w_160/1cb95fa8.jpg,2012-02-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16278-field-music-plumb/,Memphis Industries,"Field Music have spent most of their career making post-punk for pop lovers. Like their North East England brethren the Futureheads and Maximo Park, the duo had a penchant for playing cut and paste with clichés-- paying melodic homage to Paul McCartney, but going art-school with its song form. But when the band's core members, brothers Peter and David Brewis, re-emerged from a three-year hiatus in 2010, it seemed like they had ironed out their reservations about straightforward rock'n'roll. Not only was their comeback record, Measure, a double album-- the true standard for rock excess-- but it found them writing full-fledged songs, complete with verses, choruses, and guitar solos. That's all over now, though. Field Music's latest album, Plumb, finds them returning to the deconstructionist impulses that guided their earliest records. With 15 songs in 35 minutes, this is Field Music at their most baroque-- a record of sweetly melodic miniatures that coalesce into form only long enough to tumble into the next meticulously designed song suite. Over the years, Field Music have become the world's leading ambassadors of the a distinctly British musical style, that of quaint suburban sensibility shot through with a dry self-depreciating sense of humor. The album's first three songs-- ""Start the Day Right"", ""It's Okay to Change"", and ""Sorry Again, Mate""-- tumble into one another, linked through a series of brain-teasing time signatures and transitions. But the subject matter is the stuff of the workaday world. ""Trying to beat the traffic, meet the train only guessing the time,"" sings David, pondering his commute over solemn piano chords. ""Choosing Sides"" navigates between an odd time verse and a straight-laced chorus before jettisoning both feels for a buttoned-up take on electro funk. ""I want a different idea of what better can be that doesn't necessitate having more useless shit,"" sings like a man who has come to a tough impasse with an Ikea instruction manual. For Field Music, quiet desperation is still the English way, even when they're riffing on Prince. They're better at this stuff now than they used to be, though. The band's first releases, Field Music and Tones of Town, plied the same cut and paste techniques with less success. One plinky keyboard part gave way to the next, often with little to help distinguish between ideas. Plumb has more dynamic. Where older Field Music songs used to rely heavily on static keyboard riffs, they've learned to strip down and leave space for the drums tug the song forward. Each song-snippet sounds distinct and fully realized. But it's a bit disappointing to see the Brewis brothers walk away from Measure's more conventional approach. That record's best moments, like the shimmering Big Star homage, ""You and I"", were patient and spacious. Plumb is a little too fussy. Great hooks rise up, but are quickly abandoned in the rush to the next good idea. Taken out of context, Plumb's best songs don't stand on their own quite as well. It's better to take them on all at once in single gulp.","Following their 2010 double album, Field Music's latest finds them returning to the more succinct and fractured impulses that guided their earlier work.

Given to the Wild,The Maccabees,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37bea9e61561daa6ad2/1:1/w_160/34a33007.jpeg,2012-02-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16279-the-maccabees-given-to-the-wild/,Fiction,"The Maccabees emerged at a time when UK bands had it good. In the mid-2000s, the Futureheads, Bloc Party, and Arctic Monkeys all released exciting debuts. And there was enough connective tissue between the groups to make them feel like they somehow belonged together-- shared post-punk influences helped in that regard. These bands made sense both in isolation and as a whole; the Maccabees debut record, Colour it In, slotted just fine on the racks next to Maximo Park. In 2012, the world of indie bands in the UK is more fractured, and the Maccabees struggle to find a foothold. They are the sort of band that looks much better in a throng. There's nothing especially remarkable about them and, at this point, they feel like a reflection of the stalled state of British indie music in general. Perhaps as a way to shake things up, the band's third record, Given to the Wild, looks to the sound of Wild Beasts and Foals, two of the few real UK indie success stories of the past couple of years. On a similar tip they also enlist Tim Goldsworthy of DFA fame to produce, though there's very little you would usually associate with him on this record. Setting aside the obvious grabs from other bands and sounds, there are moments where the darker hues suggest that this is in fact a more interesting direction for the Maccabees. ""Child"", for example, revolves around an elastic bassline, brass, and descending guitar patterns, and the harmonies are nicely laid for the first couple of minutes. The sense of restraint is effective, allowing enough space to open up for each of those pleasing elements, but then the final couple of minutes spoil things, especially when an uninvited gaudy, prog-guitar line crowds the party. Elsewhere on Given to the Wild, the Maccabees grasp for big sounds and big ideas but fall way short. On ""Forever I've Known"", singer Orlando Weeks does his best Win Butler impression, and it's so accurate you could be forgiven for checking the liner notes for a guest appearance credit. It doesn't stop with the voice either. Weeks also mines classic Arcade Fire tropes with his lyrics-- mortality, time, loss-- but there's no narrative, just a jumble of barely connected platitudes and simplistic resolutions such as, ""Forever I've known, nothing stays forever."" They shoot for the bigger picture again on ""Pelican"", but there's no insight or depth to clichés such as, ""One thing's for sure, we're all getting older"" and ""Before you know it, pushing up the daisies"". These are sentiments that would feel banal on a Facebook news feed, let alone an album by a major label recording artist. Any hint of an interesting idea or sound on this record has been done better by somebody else-- and quite recently, too. Surely there's nobody that would trade the rich textures and awkward sexual drama of ""Plaything"" by Wild Beasts for a bland quickie with anything on Given to the Wild. The personalities on this album are so blank the songs may as well be performed by apps, and sung by Siri. The overriding message you get from Given to the Wild is that life is too short. As it clocks in at nearly an hour, but feels much, much longer, you finally think they might have a point.","Shifting gears from their first two records, the UK band's newest features production from Tim Goldsworthy and aims for a sound closer to Foals and Wild Beasts.

And Never Ending Nights,Loops of Your Heart,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3669d034d5c69bf4ce5/1:1/w_160/8d2064ae.jpeg,2012-02-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16264-and-never-ending-nights/,Magazine,"Axel Willner has had loops on his mind a lot lately. He should, probably: A broad definition of ""loop"" would encompass every single component piece of Wilner's work, especially given his fondness for manicured sampling as the Field. His third Field album, Looping State of Mind, dropped last fall, and here he returns as Loops of Your Heart, a new project in the vein of the masters of German electronic music from whom he takes many of his cues. I'm always surprised, when revisiting the Field albums, how fast the tracks are. Willner's tempos blur his loops into proto-trance, and they would sound furious if they weren't so pretty. On And Never Ending Nights, Willner slows his roll. His loops, instead of being swept into currents of sound, ripple in muddy puddles. The result is a small and willing homage to the earthen psychedelia of artists like Ash Ra Tempel, Cluster, and Klaus Schulze. It's an attractive position for Willner to take: The Field records are airtight and modern, rarely betraying influence. Never Ending Nights is too sober to effect the Martian moonscapes of those early electronic masters: It is compact in concept and execution. Where Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Tempel allowed their instruments to fever for 20 and 30 minutes, Willner attacks and releases precisely. Maybe we're all inured to these extended, chapped arpeggios, or perhaps Willner is too tethered to his predecessors, but Never Ending Nights settles into a comfy pocket somewhere between motorik patter and ambiet drift. Willner is most successful when he tunes one of his sequencers to a snake-y rhythm. ""Broken Bow"" clangs and quivers for three minutes before a prowling synthesizer and growling guitar feedback hijack the track. ""Lost in the Mirror"" is too simple and good to screw up: a phasing arpeggio tickles the red as saucers hover. It is one excellent note. But if Willner seems in exact control of rhythmic elements, he's less certain of glacial ones. ""Neukölln"" and ""Cries"" both lack conviction, trusting the lapping tones of his keyboards to provide both beauty and structure. Never Ending Nights does contain one truly modern moment. During the opening minutes of ""Little You, You Should Develop""-- a pretty, faded bauble-- titular electronic splinters rise from the background. It's the singular sound-- I kid you not-- of a cell phone brushing too close to a speaker (and just as you check for flashing lights while driving and listening to hip-hop, so too will you check the location of your phone). Loops of Your Heart isn't as darkly imaginative as Black to Comm or as committed as Emeralds, and we are long past the point where we can call this manner of composition ""experimental."" Willner, though, is an able synth scientist and a reverent listener.  Never Ending Nights contains just enough detail to save it from pastiche and in doing so offers a glimpse into Willner's influences.","Axel Willner of the Field slows down and crafts an ambient album under a new moniker that brings to mind the early masters of German electronic music.

Young and Old,Tennis,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35fb1335d7bf169a5ad/1:1/w_160/da96a316.jpeg,2012-02-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16252-young-and-old/,Fat Possum,"The title of Tennis' second album could almost as easily describe the first. The music on last year's Cape Dory bobbed sweetly between Brill Building tunefulness and classic indie pop production values, and the basic lyrical themes were at least as old as jazz standard ""A Sailboat in the Moonlight"", hold the moonlight. But the sailing trip that inspired the Colorado-based band's debut also fulfilled something newer: the internet's need for easily digestible narrative. Luckily, core married couple Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley had a real knack for breezy, deceptively simple beach-pop that could get lodged in your head and inspire your own seafaring daydreams. Or at least make you jealous. Another story would seem to apply to Young and Old, and it's the one about the ""difficult"" sophomore record. Musically, Tennis have broadened their horizons just the right amount, adding rock'n'roll muscle and a more purely pop clarity under the oversight of the Black Keys' drummer Patrick Carney, who produced. A few songs still hit at the sense of love-drunk reverie that turned older tracks like ""Marathon"" and ""South Carolina"" into blog and college-radio hits. But Tennis couldn't keep writing sailing songs forever, and the new batch doesn't pull us into their world quite as easily-- and it's not only for lack of convenient biographical shorthand. They've gone from under the boardwalk to stuck in the middle. For all that, a whole lot of what's new here improves on the debut. Under Carney's direction, Tennis upgrade their sonics without losing the fuzz. In fact, sometimes there's even more fuzz, such as in the nicely clanging lead riff on the album's first advance mp3, sprightly piano-popper ""Origins"". Moore's full-throated lilt and multi-hued keyboard, along with Riley's lissome guitar lines, still aren't that far down the innocent coast from Beach House's supine dream-pop, and now there are extra layers of vocal harmonies, such as the appealingly Free Design-jazzy sha-la-las on ""Petition"". But Carney especially brings life to the percussion, whether it's the huge handclaps on ""My Better Self"", a swooning standout reminiscent of the Owls' underrated mid-2000s indie-pop gem ""Air"", or the snapping snares on ""High Road"". ""Paradise is all around, but happiness is never found,"" Moore sings on that last song, which might've been a strong unifying theme for the sophomore album-- a melancholy flipside to the debut's paradise-is-paradise uplift. Sure, the songs on Young and Old occasionally bring back the romance of movement (optimistic ""Traveling""), and they're often introspective, but instead the effect tends to be too confused, stilted, or generic to really pack the same wallop. The album's first words, on mellow strummer ""It All Feels the Same"", are ""took a train,"" a potentially intriguing counterpart to sailing that isn't properly explored elsewhere on the record. Rather than at sea or on the railroad, the lyrics lean toward awkward abstraction: ""Will you make my children bear the consequences everywhere?"" asks ""Origins"". Even on ""My Better Self"", Moore philosophizes clumsily, ""What is innate, I do not know/ But meaning comes and it goes."" She sort of has a point, though. As easy as it is to criticize acts that come to us with a ready-built narrative alongside their music, storytelling and image-making have always been crucial elements of pop. What matters isn't whether a record comes with extra-musical buzz attached, but whether the music is good enough to capitalize on that buzz. Cape Dory, to my ears, was; Young and Old is another example of a promising young act that found an audience quickly on the internet before fully coming into its own powers. In other words, it's pretty good, but also a bit disappointing. There's still plenty of time, though, and by album three, the duo that never originally set out to make music will have something else that can be invaluable for a working band: a little more experience in the trenches.","On their second LP, Tennis take the Brill Building tunefulness and classic indie-pop production values of their debut and add a bit of rock'n'roll muscle. Patrick Carney of Black Keys produces.

And They Turned Not When They Went,Imbogodom,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37513d197565213a942/1:1/w_160/4a25843f.jpeg,2012-02-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16275-and-they-turned-not-when-they-went/,Thrill Jockey,"Imbogodom's music can feel like walking inside a strange house at night and finding yourself momentarily startled by the sound of your own breath. Equal parts psych-folk songsmithery and musique concrète, the project came together when New Zealand's Daniel Beban, a multi-instrumentalist and tape artist, was chalking and splicing tape for a living at the BBC World Service. Intrigued by some discarded reel-to-reel tape machines he uncovered inside the station's studios, he began building compositions out of tape loops, and invited his guitarist friend Alexander Tucker to come jam. Like their 2010 debut, The Metallic Year, the group's new record, And They Turned Not When They Went, reflects the slightly hallucinatory experiences that can arise from staying up very late at night and opening your ears. Recorded partly at the BBC's Bush House, and partly in a lighthouse in the marshy Dungeness region of Kent, it unfolds in a series of atmosphere-dripping vignettes, shuttling strangely and abruptly from ramshackle folk to astral ambience and the sounds of a bell striking the wee hours of the morning. And They Turned Not When They Went opens with the deep, resonant groan of London's Big Ben, gently folded into tape-manipulated whirs, loop-de-loops, and grinding drones. But Imbogodom's music is more than just library-music clichés. Wherever they fall on the scale from abstraction to songcraft, the album's 10 tracks reflect a constant negotiation between sound manipulation and live instrumentation, or analog tape machine and guitar, cello, piano, vocals, drums, and any number of non-musical objects that one of the two members might happen to pick up. Songs trail off with cascading echoes that recall the transitions of dub music; notes are manipulated to take on new meaning. The layered vocal line on album standout ""Heir Looms"", for example, is easily pretty enough to stand on its own, but it is all the more beautiful for the moments when it shifts abruptly, echoing into oblivion or pitched up an octave. Similar manipulations on ""Welcome Away"" transform a spoken word ""wrong number"" skit into a haunted phone call from the other side of the mirror, and extreme slowing of vox on tracks like ""Etchum Buoy"" and ""I Am Here, I Am Gone"" yields a cross between throat singing and the breathing of a sleeping creature. Listening to Imbogodom's second album, there's the feeling that, beyond its interest as a technical exercise, speeding or slowing a given sound can set something free within it. Not all of the sounds here are easy on the ears, and the music can encompass discomfort, even ugliness. Cello can sound warm and rich or exposed and raw; the loose-skinned, off-kilter drum patter and tuneless guitar picking on ""Window Faces"" sounds like an intentionally clumsy attempt at an acoustic marching band. You may not feel pleasure all the way through And They Turned Not When They Went, but if you're drawn to the bizarre, inconstant emotional terrain of late-night wakefulness, you'll find something honest.","The experimental outfit's latest is equal parts psych-folk songsmithery and musique concrète.

Hotel Amour,Terranova,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b373c0084474cd0c211a/1:1/w_160/a57da6fa.jpeg,2012-02-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16273-hotel-amour/,Kompakt,"Paris-dwelling DJ and producer Fetisch, who makes up one half of Terranova with the Berlin-based house and techno-oriented artist &ME, could no doubt spin a yarn or two about pivotal events in the history of club culture. If you're looking for someone who's been there, done that, and has all the scars to prove it, Fetisch is your man. He's spun records at Danceteria and Tunnel in New York; recorded at Conny Plank's legendary Cologne studio; found himself at the epicenter of the original illegal rave boom in England; and worked with Manuel Göttsching, Tricky, and Ari-up from the Slits. Their latest record even features a bizarre cameo from German horror and exploitation actor Udo Kier. It's clearly a career that bears no particular focus or shape, with the many-sided tracks on Hotel Amour spinning off from the all-embracing approach Fetisch has gleefully wallowed in over the years. As such, this is a record with a handful of standout songs struggling and straining against one another after being crammed into the standard album format. It feels like a collection of tracks screaming for individual attention, like precocious children all holding their hands up at the same time in class. The strength of Terranova's vocal collaborators are the primary cause of that, with Fetisch and &ME drawing on some fiercely individual talent. Copenhagen-based singer Tomas Høffding leaves a sizable imprint, in particular on ""Question Mark"", which is positioned somewhere between the blubstep croon of Jamie Woon and Antony Hegarty's work with Hercules and Love Affair. Elsewhere, the soft vocal intonations of Khan lend Hotel Amour the aura of post-rave comedown, particularly on the blissfully understated ""So Strong"". The stylistic thrust of this album is caught somewhere between the current and the deep past, with shades of modern pop production layered over the stripped-back grooves of vintage house. There aren't too many straightforward club bangers here, but there are a few old school thrills to be derived from the undulating TB-303 bass ripples of ""I Want to Go Out"" and ""By My Side"". But taking such an unabashedly retro approach on certain tracks feels jarring when Terranova strive to be forward-thinking elsewhere. ""Take My Hand"", the standout here, is all coarse, sputtering rhythms, clattering tin-pot drums, and heavily dubbed-out vocals. The closing ""Prayer"", featuring Kier's glowering spoken-word extracts and a straight-down-the-line piece of torch singing from German vocalist Nicolette Krebitz, is driven by the same kind of ambition DJ Hell was stirring up on his outstanding 2009 album Teufelswerk. But those tracks are mostly anomalies, with too much of Hotel Amour sinking into territory that has been heavily mined in recent times. Billie Ray Martin gives an impressively robust vocal performance on ""Make Me Feel"", but there's nothing in the limp backing that elevates it beyond the bevy of pallid trip-hop clones that clutched hard to the coattails of Massive Attack's Blue Lines 20 years ago. There's been a deluge of producers striving hard to work a darker edge into their material over the past decade, and it feels like it will take something very special to stand out in a marketplace bursting at the seems with alleyway-dwelling artists scrambling to translate early-morning post-ecstasy cityscapes into song. This isn't that record, but in ""Take My Hand"" and ""Prayer"", there is a way out of the gloom, providing some distance from the genre mimicry it ducks into elsewhere.","Drawing on some fiercely individual vocal collaborators, Paris-dwelling DJ/producer Fetisch and Berlin-based techno-oriented artist &ME's latest LP is caught somewhere between the current and the deep past.

Melt,Young Magic,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b336b1335d7bf169a55a/1:1/w_160/ee8898f6.jpeg,2012-02-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16225-young-magic-melt/,Carpark,"Some records are defined by the time and place of their creation, but Young Magic's piecemeal approach has the opposite effect. It doesn't sound like it came from a certain somewhere, but rather everywhere. And it's a surprisingly cohesive work considering that it was recorded in several different countries and sutured together from singles and B-sides that have been around since 2010. So yeah, Melt-- that's a great word for Young Magic's debut, but ""blur,"" ""smear,"" or ""dissolve"" would also be acceptable. I suppose it goes without saying that Melt might inadvertently align itself with hyphenated genres many of you are looking to conscientiously avoid. It's a reductive, but not completely off-base, assumption. Sure, these tracks are underpinned by West African rhythms (""The Dancer""), Brainfeeder's non-quantized drum smacks (""Sanctuary""), and the stutters of dubstep (""Drawing Down the Moon""). But for all of the trio's globe-trotting origins (two are Australian ex-pats, one is a native Indonesian, and all have traveled to multiple continents), there's an introversion and physical distance which bring to mind kids looking for the perfect beat while hunched over samplers and laptops in their apartments. But while the reverb is ample and the edges are soft, it's a choice more functional than fashionable, a conscious production decision to solder together disparate sounds into a textured whole. The rare times they're present, guitars are tremeloed and processed to sound like balalaikas as opposed to chorded instruments, and while the melodies are often pumped out by harsh, exaggerated synths, the percussion most often takes the tone of household objects-- rattling coins on ""Sparkly"", pitched water jugs on ""Slip Time"", alarm clocks and cell phones elsewhere. It's a cushy listen, if not only always distinctive, particularly since the shorter tracks often amount to a cooled, deep-blue gelatin that holds the previously released singles together. But those three tracks instantly stand out less because of their familiarity and more because it's where Young Magic really leans into the listener rather than kicking back. Aggression isn't really their game, so the chain-gang lurch of ""Sparkly"" effectively starts Melt on a slowly menacing opening note, while the warped war chant of ""You With Air"" undergoes subtle digital damage that gives it tonal ambivalence. The centerpiece ""Night in the Ocean"" has a fairly self-explanatory title, but an accurate one-- at once pulverizing and pristine, it's an HD stunner amidst mostly Hipstamatic surrounding. These are also the best showcases for the interplay of Young Magic's vocalists: Melati Malay's coo flutters and glides as more of a shoegazey texture than a vessel for communication, and while certainly not as pretty, Isaac Emmanuel has something of a wounded half-rap that's ultimately more distinctive. Particularly when they trade off stoned mutters and airy ecstasy on ""Night in the Ocean"", you could imagine Salem, had they formed during the best semester abroad ever. But Melt can just as easily be seen as pragmatic, offering solutions to questions left unanswered by some of the more disappointing trajectories taken by fellow indie psych travelers who once called NYC home: Are you a Yeasayer fan who instantly felt buyer's remorse the moment ""The Children"" introduced the wonky electro boondoggle Odd Blood? Wished High Places still sounded as, well, high as they did on their EPs? Just wanna see Here We Go Magic underwater? Melt has got your back. But those comparisons are every bit as useful for contrast-- you could get a sense of these bands' personalities beyond the manner in which they arranged their sounds, and it's tougher to parse what Young Magic have to say. Are Young Magic hippies? Naive adventurers? Shut-ins obsessed with looping pedals? Melt conjures these admirable comparisons while avoiding any sort of concrete answer, but ultimately Young Magic can aspire to more by letting us know where they're coming from in a figurative sense.","From their name on down, Young Magic seem very of-the-moment. Their debut album pulls together West African rhythms, twitchy beats, and the requisite layer of reverb.

Year of the Tiger,Fucked Up,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36dc0084474cd0c2114/1:1/w_160/23199e6c.jpeg,2012-02-10 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16267-fucked-up-year-of-the-tiger/,Matador,"Total running time of Year of the Tiger: 37:35. Total running time of the Ramones' debut album: 29:04. Total running time of Nick Drake's Pink Moon: 28:22. Total running time of Fela Kuti's Expensive Shit: 24:13. Let's call this an album, OK? In any case, Fucked Up have been releasing long songs for each year of the Chinese Zodiac since 2006, although they're running a little behind at the moment. (The Year of the Tiger ended in February 2011; we've passed through the Rabbit Year and are now in the Dragon Year.) Year of the Tiger is a pair of tracks that have been around for a while-- the band claimed to have finished the title song almost two years ago. It's the first music we've heard from the band in a while that doesn't have some formal connection to their David Comes to Life project. ""Year of the Tiger"" itself is a 15-minute song with a very long lyric (apparently by guitarist Mike Haliechuk) about an aging tiger approaching his death. Fucked Up's lead bellower Damian Abraham gets most of the words to himself, although he's also got some support: former Del-Byzanteens singer/keyboardist Jim Jarmusch-- yes, fine, he's a director, too-- intones a few verses, and either Annie-Claude Deschênes (of Duchess Says) or Katie Stelmanis (of Austra) or both add the pretty hey-I-can-actually-sing vocals that FU have been using for contrast with Abraham's voice over the past few years. The marvelous thing about ""Year of the Tiger"" is that it's actually a fully constructed song, not a vamp-with-solos or a chain of vaguely related pieces segued together; it builds and builds and builds, with one new riff after another uncoiling itself and wrapping around the pillar of all the others. It's bombastic as hell, of course-- the keyboard part is the closest Fucked Up have ever come to Meat Loaf-- but this is the product of a band that thinks big. The song's weak point is its lyrics, which have lots of sharply observed images (""his castle of gristle and bone""), but also too many passages with dodgy or overwrought diction (""that deathly coddle of light""). Abraham's guttural howl is a great equalizer of lyrics, but the sung sections reveal the words' awkwardness: Lines such as, ""Light drips like paint from heaven/ A shining pall on the horizon,"" are easier to get away with screamed than chirped. Fucked Up's blog describes the second side of Year of the Tiger, ""Onno"", as ""a weird rager,"" which is about right. It appears to be a full-on 22-minute instrumental palindrome, a pyramidal stack of drones and riffs with a crashing forward-and-backward beat-- the closest thing they've ever produced to Melvins' more extreme recordings, or to Hüsker Dü's ""Dreams Reoccurring"". For a ""studio experiment,"" it's exceptionally listenable: Again, this band is great at arrangements, and every five-second segment of this record sounds almost but not quite like the one next to it. If it were in a movie soundtrack, it'd have to be in a sequence with a violently strobing red light. It's too much, too much, too much-- exactly what we rely on Fucked Up for, that is. Who would ask for anything less?","The newest installment in Fucked Up's series of songs for each year of the Chinese Zodiac is a pair of tracks that have been around for a while: a 15-minute song featuring Jim Jarmusch and a 22-minute instrumental paldindrome.

Ten$ion,Die Antwoord,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36eb1335d7bf169a5c1/1:1/w_160/9b34bb44.jpeg,2012-02-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16270-tenion/,ZEF,"If you're unfamiliar, Die Antwoord operate on the principle of ""zef,"" a philosophy of intentional ignorance and crassness. It's the latest in series of personas for rapper Ninja, né Watkin Tudor Jones, but even with that conceptual bent in mind, it's still hard to process Die Antwoord as an idea, especially on Ten$ion where they replace what made them sometimes intriguing and slightly subversive with tired and tropes and lazy lyrics. In some ways it's the worst of both worlds: We've seen and heard it all before, and now it's dumbed-down even further. The blunt simplicity of Ten$ion could be seen as the mastery and refinement of a fledgling aesthetic (stupid for the sake of stupid). But this is a step back. Whatever cultural interrogation Die Antwoord might have been performing with $O$-- and it was hard to tell-- is totally absent here. Die Antwoord abandoned their deal with Universal because of perceived pressure to be ""like everyone else out there at the moment,"" and it's immediately clear from Ten$ion opener ""Never Le Nkemise 1"" that their sound has gotten a whole lot more... expensive. Earlier tracks like as ""Enter the Ninja"" and ""Wat Kyk Jy?"" hinted at big-room ambitions but still sounded endearingly cheap and shoddy. But ""Never Le Nkemise 1"" begins with a blockbuster-worthy bit of string-led melodrama and pseudo-choral vocals and quickly slams down into a-- what else?-- dubstep throwdown, all fiery blazes of scorched-earth LFO threatening to drown out Ninja's screeches of ""that's why we keep it motherfucking gangsturrrrr!"" Say what you want about this zany group of South Africans, but attention-grabbing early singles like ""Enter the Ninja"" at least showed a clever dimension to their sound, with quick-fire raps that were easy enough to get swept up in. But there's nothing remotely thought-out or careful about Ten$ion. Not that anyone expected subtlety from Die Antwoord, but this is id rap at its worst, and even their excess lacks scope or imagination. By its very nature, the Die Antwoord project is style-over-substance, but Ten$ion goes out of its way to prove that point. The boasting shouts of ""'EY SEXEE, 'EY SEXEE"" on the chorus of ""Hey Sexy"" are hopelessly awkward, and Ninja's Ludacris crib, ""Get out the bitch, get out the way,"" feels like an embarrassingly misguided attempt at relating this duo to mainstream hip-hop currency-- a decade too late. If their lyrics are emptier than ever (""I took drugs at the age of 13/ Jesus Christ/ What the fuck?""), their attempts at shock value ring disturbingly hollow. If you aren't getting a little restless by the album's ending stretch, ""DJ Hi-Tek Rulez"" might snap you out of a cock-eyed stupor with its gruff, digitally altered grunts of ""DJ Hi-Tek will fuck you in the ass... You can't touch me, faggot,"" amid other violently homophobic slurs. There's no shortage of allowances made for this kind of stuff in hip-hop, on an album this silly and concerned with dumb, thoughtless fun, it's especially troubling. It doesn't sound anything like a joke in the impenetrably convoluted layers of irony and self-mythologizing that is Die Antwoord. What are we left with then? Die Antwoord were stuck with the ""rave-rap"" tag from the beginning, and it wasn't too bad a description, emphasizing not only the trio's danceability and playfulness but also its stark-raving-mad, go-for-broke tendencies. But this time around, the emphasis is on the ""rave."" Which is great for the in-house production but detrimental to pretty much everything else. The songs here are even less collected than before, jumping from flashpoint to flashpoint in a frenzied hunger to see how many times they can climax in each four-minute chunk of energy. It's exhausting, and the fragmentary, dissociative scatter takes the vitality and primacy out of the music. For a band so obsessed with its own self-consciously humorous image, Ten$ion in part fails because it feels so strangely humorless. So while they might have succeeded in their quest to bypass the constraints of major-label rules and pressures-- apparently Universal rejected the album for being too vulgar-- they've gone and picked the most unfortunate parts of their oversized, manufactured personalities to highlight. Ten$ion is proof that you need more than just aesthetic and press savvy to really get by. They might have left their potentially comfortable new home to forge their own path, but Die Antwoord sound like they have no idea where they're going.","Not that anyone expected subtlety from Die Antwoord, but the South African trio's second studio album is id rap at its worst, lacking scope or imagination even in its excess.

Lineage,Shigeto,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36cc0084474cd0c2110/1:1/w_160/79a16045.jpeg,2012-02-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16269-lineage/,Ghostly,"Above all else, Zach Saginaw respects heritage. Shigeto, his primary alias for recording homespun electronic music, is not only his middle name but also that of his grandfather; another of his aliases, Frank Omura, is a reference to his familial bloodline. Running through his past two releases, 2010's full-length Full Circle and his latest mini-LP, Lineage, is a series of songs titled ""Ann Arbor"", after the Michigan town that he grew up performing music in (another track off the latter, ""Huron River Drive"", takes its name from a stretch of road in Ann Arbor). Like so many recent albums by young, electronic-fixated musicians, Lineage's cover is adorned with a faded photograph, but this one's far from an Instagram: It's a picture of Saginaw's great-grandfather's house in Hiroshima, circa 1916. On the back cover of Lineage's vinyl release, you'll find a picture of said grandfather, taken at Grenada, Colorado's Amache Internment Camp during the period of Japanese-American internment that took place in the U.S. in 1942. Lineage's musical contents look to the past for inspiration as well, and given the history that Saginaw's lined the walls of this release with, it would be understandable to anticipate a sort of dusty, archival crate-digging revisionism à la French-Vietnamese producer Onra's Chinoiseries. However, Lineage's sonic nostalgia is reaching to a different, chronologically closer point in time-- specifically, 2003, when fellow knob-twiddler Kieran Hebden dropped the influential Rounds under his Four Tet alias. Rounds (and a lot of proceeding music that sounded like Rounds) was affixed with the unfortunate-in-hindsight ""folktronica"" tag, primarily due to its expert meshing of glitchy-yet-pastoral textures and traditional instrumentation that took a left turn from the blippy ones and zeroes that marked IDM. You could tag a fair amount of what Saginaw's done here as ""pastoral"", too. The quaint melodies and twinkling mechanisms of Lineage suggest a patient, natural beauty, one that fits his production capabilities far better than Full Circle's stutter-and-swell instrumental hip-hop leanings. There's very little here that would stand out when removed from the release's context, the buzzed thrum of ""Field Trip"" being Lineage's most out-and-out melodically bold moment. Don't mistake subtlety for a lack of playfulness, though: ""A Child's Mind"", easily the mini-LP's highlight, takes a tumbling drum set and transforms it into a coffee-house-clubby shake. In addition to being a producer, Saginaw is a drummer, and ""A Child's Mind"" excellently plays to his rhythmic strengths. No one's going to mistake a track like this for an actual band performing, rather than a glasses-wearing young person playing the role of digital alchemist-- but if you close your eyes and expand your imagination just a little, the whole thing almost sounds human. That man-machine perfectionism is what makes Lineage's concise neatness a step up from the charmingly ramshackle boom-bap of Full Circle, but Saginaw's natural competency is also his downfall. Lineage's clean style and easily admirable sound might seem refreshing when taken into context with the teeming pot of acid-stained, bunk-bed J Dilla imitators that continue to clog up RSS feeds with poorly-tagged MP3s and 1980s-sitcom-referencing artwork, but the fact of the matter is that Lineage isn't the first record to sound like Lineage. Understand that I'm not knocking Saginaw for being unoriginal, necessarily, especially since the results are quite enjoyable-- but the fact remains that, both within the Ghostly label's roster and when taking into account the bedroom electronic scene as a whole, listening to capable replicas of yesteryear is starting to lose its luster. Clearly, Saginaw has plenty of reverence for the past, and that's fine-- but something that sounds like the future, well, wouldn't that be nice?","Zach Saginaw follows 2010's Full Circle with a mini-LP of homespun electronic music that traces his family bloodlines along with electronica's recent past.

Be the Void,Dr. Dog,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3715e6ef95969322467/1:1/w_160/bad8839e.jpeg,2012-02-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16268-be-the-void/,Anti-,"Shame, Shame was Dr. Dog's sixth LP, and their first with an outside producer. Though they'd hit the studio with frequent Elliott Smith collaborator Rob Schnapf with that oft-parroted aim of bringing their spirited live show to the recording booth, the outsider's presence helped the Philly rockers shave some of the shaggy excess from their earlier efforts, teasing out their bright, bouncy, McCartney-indebted melodies. Critics, largely resistant to Dr. Dog's retrograde charms, praised the disc; our own Zach Kelly rightly noted that its ""bigger, more charismatic sound"" felt like ""the work of a younger, wide-eyed outfit."" Be the Void arrives without the guiding hand of Schnapf, or anybody really; opting, as before, to go it alone, on its seventh LP, the band returns to the sunburnt sprawl of its first few records. You've got your big, bulbous melodies, your rattly unplugged strums, your mile-long solos; in vocalists Scott McMicken and Toby Leaman, you've got yourself a veritable two-man harmony factory stocked with enough whisky and cigarettes to get you through the spring. All this-- and what seems to be a fairly encyclopedic history of popular American rock music from, oh, 1968 through 1974-- are pretty much the same cards they've been shuffling since the start, but as Schnapf's work on Shame proved, they fare best when they're a little uncomfortable, when somebody's there to tell them no. Its melodies are, as ever, sturdy, its production warm and homespun. But too often, Be the Void finds Dr. Dog unleashed, letting their wilder ideas get the better of them. Take ""Warrior Man"", a supposed practice-room pisstake now taking up space on a Dr. Dog record. Caught out somewhere between Black Sabbath, Styx's ""Mr. Roboto"", and Paul Revere and the the Raiders' ""Indian Reservation"", the song depicts some kind of interstellar junkyard Al Gore-type rattling around the dump for a longer-than-it-feels five minutes. It's not a bad little stomp they get going underneath the stoned sci-fi, but it's not enough to salvage this particular heap from its own silliness. Surely an outside presence would've told them to let the dopily one-note ""Warrior Man"" stay, at most, a B-side. Then there's ""That Old Black Hole"", a sort of sub-Paul Simon cliche-flipper (""there are eggshells on the floor; therefore, I never touch the ground,"" which, y'know, just makes good sense) too impressed with its own supposed cleverness to ever make a lick of sense. They've never been ace lyricists, but I do miss the neighborly, come-grab-a-beer vibe of their We All Belong era; here, they seem to be going for some kind of vagueness-as-profundity business that rarely gets its point across. ""Let's just clear the air,"" McMicken sings on ""Over Here, Over There"", before adding ""I am over here, I'm over there."" This clears nothing, McMicken! The melodic zig-zag and sly groove of ""Heavy Light"", the buzzing National steel beneath gospel-twang closer ""Turning the Century"", the room sound, and the warmth generated by McMicken and Leaman's voices as they come together in (yet another) harmony are all reasons to recommend Be the Void. But, for every moment of clarity, a rose-colored note of reverence for the past wafts in and threatens to blot out some of Void's would-be bright spots. Though the jaunty ""Over There"" nicks the verse melody from Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good"" wholesale, by and large, any outright theft's been a bit better concealed. ""Big Girl"" is generically Stonesy, right down to the slight whiff of misogyny; ""Get Away"", meanwhile, locates the Seals & Crofts at the heart of Fleet Foxes. And the rust-colored, harmony-doused, Beatles-meets-Band stuff's in full evidence here as well; creaky opener ""Lonesome"", a kind of Scarlett-style postscript to Hank Williams' immortal ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" (not, sadly, written from the whippoorwills' perspective), could've easily tumbled off of the back half of Cahoots. At the risk of getting all Retromania on you, it's no crime in and of itself that Dr. Dog borrow liberally from the past; their trouble lies in what they do with the stuff. The answer, seven albums in? A resounding ""let it be.""","After recording their sixth record with Rob Schnapf, the Philadelphia rockers go it alone again on album seven, something of a return to the sunburnt sprawl of their first few LPs.

Subject: Matter,Homeboy Sandman,by: Jeff Weiss,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b370b1335d7bf169a5c3/1:1/w_160/43a443c4.jpeg,2012-02-09 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16271-homeboy-sandman-subject-matter/,Stones Throw,"The old order of Underground Rap went rudderless for a variety of reasons. Illegal downloading ruptured the already weak tendons of small independent labels. Fans favored 1990s nostalgia over out-there artistry. Top producers got tired of dealing with rap-biz bullshit and opted for MC-free experimentations with jazz, soul, and electronic. But my favorite theory is that most people got tired of rappers rapping about rapping. Due to its nature as a reactionary sect, for the underground to evolve, it had to do something more than stand athwart history and yell, ""chill!!"" (In this re-enactment, William F. Buckley is played by KRS-One). And there is no more elliptical act this side of a Steve Reich riff than writing lyrics about your lyrics. Yeah, it might have been a building block in the on-and-on-to-the-break-of-dawn days, but as George Harrison and Fatlip pointed out: All things pass. Swag will be ill before we know it. Over the last 24 months, an ideology-free counter-culture rebuilt itself, waving different banners and maintaining few borders. It's an underground in lowercase letters, a constellation encircling everyone from Detroit amphetamine enthusiast Danny Brown to sardonic arsonists Das Racist and Open Mike Eagle, to anesthetized Oakland cloud rappers, to the Prosciutto-plumped adenoidal New Yorker Action Bronson, and the cold-hearted Hempstead Rambo, Roc Marciano. It includes older gods like Ishmael Butler (Shabazz Palaces/Digable Planets), Aesop Rock, Brooklyn Bomb Squad scion El-P, and the Dungeon Family's Killer Mike. So fluid are its boundaries that the latter two did a record together funded by Adult Swim money. Enter Sandman. So anachronistic as to appropriate the slang, ""Homeboy."" Born name: Angel Del Villar. An ex-teacher, Ivy League undergraduate, and Hofstra Law student psychologically aligned to the older underground of 1995, when the term meant Beatnuts and Do You Want More?!!!??!, not Jurassic 5 and flip-flops. Sandman is the type of rapper beloved by hip-hop traditionalists: proudly old school, technically savage, and lyrically sharp. In the all-star game of the new subterranean, he is the guy with flawless fundamentals, wearing his socks high and his cleats sharp and polished. So it was little surprise when the surviving infrastructure of the 1990s immediately supported Sandman: underground hip hop radio, the Nuyorican Poets Café, the XXL Chairman's Choice column, and rap's Daily Worker, Okayplayer. The straw poll was sealed when Sandman signed with Stones Throw, one of the last garrisons of the late 90s, an imprint blessed with the resources to shower him with proper promo, branding, and an array of dazzling sun- and smoke-carved beats. East meets west on Subject: Matter, Sandman's debut EP for the label of Madlib and Dâm-Funk. To accompany the introduction, Sandman added a subtext to his six-song collection, noting on its cover that they encompass content that ""no one has ever rapped about before in the history of rap music. Unfortunately not a very difficult thing to do."" Sandman is as Queens as the Unisphere, and his braggadocio bears a boldness that suggests that he grew up in the Bridge not Elmhurst. It's probably unnecessary arrogant, but it also reflects a welcome sign of ambition. Few deducted points from Lil Wayne for boasting that he was the greatest rapper alive (even if 49 percent of the electorate disagreed). Nor should they blame Sandman much for his myopic history. After all, the man can rhyme. A former saxman, Sandman takes a modal approach with his screwball flow that dips and dives, stops and starts. He bevels his patterns at bizarre angles, employing a vocabulary worthy of Lisa Simpson. He's unapologetic about his intelligence, and even if it skirts the line of pretension, he keeps a progressive approach. Not only does he carefully weigh the importance of ""being nice,"" he's focused on vivid storytelling too. Subject: Matter is both a self-challenge and the hurling of a gauntlet. Sandman wants to see his peers expand their imagination. And while the modern-day rap world has no scarcity of songs channeling topics of the zeitgeist (the entirety of XXX, 1/3 of Watch the Throne, whatever you make of Lil B), his originality is warmly welcomed, if not demanded. So though ""The Miracle"" parallels the storylines of Pharoahe Monch's ""Rape"" and Mos Def's ""Love"", it offers a penetrating analysis of the act of creation from Sandman's side. ""Unforgettable"" tells the tale of the woe brought onto a man too sprung on his ex. It mirrors a less-graphic version of Ghostface Killah's ""Marvel"", but Sandman spins his own saga of picking up mediocre girls at Best Buy and sexing them while reminiscing on his last conquest. ""Canned Goods"" is about canned goods. Closing track ""Soap"" pictures a biblical deluge washing away the inequities of the world. The psychedelic, elegiac beats are handled by 2 Hungry Bros, Ben Grymm, the Audible Doctor, rThentic RTNC, and the latest Stones Throw rated rookie, Jonwayne. Despite the diffuse cast, the EP feels exceptionally cohesive; it's also a throwback to the days when A&R departments actually existed. A half-decade ago, a record like this would've been needlessly over-hyped, with true-schoolers rushing to anoint Sandman the bulwark against an ineradicable tide of commercialism and greed. Now that the ""Hip Hop is Dead"" era's over, Sandman merely needs to be good. And he is. With a healthy number of his peers engaged in shoving rap onto strange terrain, Sandman is another vivid character adding to the expansion. Subject: Matter might be Sandman's best work yet, but more importantly, it's a salient reminder that a song's only perimeter is the limits of human imagination.","Unapologetic about his intelligence, Angel Del Villar is the type of rapper beloved by hip-hop traditionalists: proudly old school, technically savage, and lyrically sharp. His debut EP for Stones Throw is his best work yet.

Six Cups of Rebel,Lindstrøm,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b347b1335d7bf169a57d/1:1/w_160/41c1e21c.jpeg,2012-02-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16238-six-cups-of-rebel/,Smalltown Supersound,"Lindstrøm's second proper solo album, Six Cups of Rebel, does away with both the taut sexiness of his early work and the warm yacht breezes of Where You Go I Go Too in favor of something more bombastic but strangely cloistered. The pressure here builds and builds, but rather than taking flight, tracks like ""De Javu"" struggle with a misdirected explosion of percussion that flattens out into a farty bass riff smothered in layers of percussion. It's bloated, lifeless, and weighed down with its own multi-tracked mayhem, a thick, wet coat of gloss dragging propulsion down to a crawl more than anything else. Excess is nothing new for Lindstrøm, but on Six Cups of Rebel he sounds lost. Synths layer endlessly and drums bang and clank-- this is some Emerson, Lake & Palmer shit-- but whatever power they might possess is lost as the clutter breeds a numbing sense of saturation. The breathing room that was essential to Lindstrøm's original charm, from the rattling drums of ""Arp She Said"" to the exhilarating fly-bys of ""Where You Go I Go Too"", is nowhere to be found, replaced by a suffocating blanket of midtempo muck. For an artist whose signature track's called ""I Feel Space"", it's disheartening to hear so little of it here. His last album-length effort, 2010's Real Life is No Cool, a collaboratioin with singer Christabelle, showed that his luxurious disco could harbor vocals just fine (a theme that stretches all the way back to 2003's fantastic ""Music in My Mind""). But here Lindstrøm's own weak, garbled vocals are caught up in the soupy current of overdubs, strangled of momentum or melodic cohesion. Even worse, on ""Magik"", they're pitched-down into ugly, unnatural tones, one of those ""what could he have possibly been thinking"" moments made only worse by the creepy backing chorus that emerges halfway through. It's cringe-inducing, another misstep for a record that's already treading unsure ground. Rebel has a few nice moments. ""Quiet Place to Live"", which spends its first three minutes hobbling on an awkwardly uneven vocal hook complete with stabbing bursts of electric guitar, suddenly melts into a stunning keyboard breakdown halfway through. It's gorgeous in that silvery Lindstrøm way but completely aimless, drenching the track in generic prettiness that wears after a few bars: The vocals continue to clash and everything sounds strangely out of tune, as if he just dropped the organ carelessly on top of an entirely finished track. That brief glimmer of hope dissolves, defining the rest of the album as distinctly unmemorable, little drum fills and other pertinent details like specks of glitter on a gaudy neon canvas only adding to the fatigue. ""Call Me Anytime"" takes up a whole nine minutes, and I'll be damned if any of it's going to stick with me, as it cycles restlessly through a number of phases like it's desperately searching for some kind of magic glue to hold it all together. The album finally picks up with 10-minute closer ""Hina"", an elongated horizon of shimmering keyboards and vocoders, anxiously pumping prog rock like the breakdown of Pink Floyd's ""Dogs"" sculpted and smoothed-over into a disco edit. Shrouded in filters, Lindstrøm's vocals fit better here, and the track's relative tastefulness ends the album on a strange but refreshing note of restraint. Complacency is to be avoided, but the kind of step forward Lindstrøm tries here is a drunken, misguided one. The noxious muck on evidence here obscures most of what made his past music so singular.","Hans-Peter Lindstrøm's second solo album moves away from his taut and sparse early work in favor of something more bombastic but strangely cloistered.

The Singles,Goldfrapp,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b364c0084474cd0c2102/1:1/w_160/982e8cfc.jpeg,2012-02-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16261-the-singles/,Mute,"Goldfrapp have spent the past decade moving back and forth between icy electro-glam and atmospheric balladry, delivering these extremes in tonally consistent albums that dare to alienate listeners who favor one style over the other. Despite this polarity, the duo has a remarkably consistent aesthetic, with a gloss of aloof sexiness and cinematic glamour connecting the sci-fi cabaret number ""Utopia"", the sinister S&M throbber ""Strict Machine"", the swelling ballad ""Black Cherry"",  the glam rock stomp ""Ooh La La"", and the spacey yet pastoral folk tune ""A&E"". The Singles, their first hits collection, makes a virtue of their range. The 14-track set pares their catalog down to only their 12 most successful singles and two new recordings, resulting in a tight hour of their finest material sequenced like a dynamic, eclectic pop album. A few worthy singles didn't make the cut-- the joyous ""Alive"", the lushly psychedelic ""Caravan Girl""-- but concision trumps completism here, and chronology is tossed out in favor of cohesion. Though Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory excel at crafting delicate, seductive ambiance, their most distinctive and influential music updates the aesthetics of glam rock with a harsh, electronic edge. Their electroclash-era breakthrough hits ""Train"" and ""Strict Machine"" are built upon a mercilessly tight schaffel beat that highlights the lyrical themes of decadence and submission. A number of songs from this period aimed for this sort of severe sexiness, but Goldfrapp nailed the tone by emphasizing elegance over sleaze, and by evoking complicated, often contradictory emotions rather than simply foregrounding a lewd subtext. The cuts from Supernature, their finest album, continue on with this general sound but loosen up to express giddy infatuation on ""Number 1"" and sensual swagger on ""Ooh La La"", their most successful single to date. ""Ride a White Horse"", perhaps their greatest song, contrasts their oppressive dominatrix beat with an ecstatic, airy chorus that provides a few moments of spiritual relief before returning to a lockstep that signals a barely repressed lust. Nearly a decade on, these tracks still sound fresh and futuristic, and despite generally getting lumped in with dance music, they point in a direction of new possibilities for glam rock. With a body of work so focused on raw sexuality, it can be easy to overlook the emotional content of Goldfrapp's music. Alison's vocal performances tend to be rather understated, serving lyrics that deal with nuanced conflicts between pleasure and pain, or giving voice to desperate, lonely characters. ""A&E"", the first single from their gentle, often bleak 2008 record, Seventh Tree, is an outstanding showcase for both her lyrical and vocal strengths as she sings from the perspective of an incredibly lonely woman driven to a suicide attempt while waiting around for a phone call from a man she's not even sure she likes. The details are rich and vivid, but the drama is muted, even as her voice hits a gorgeous crest at the song's peak. Though Alison Goldfrapp is the star, her vocals often defer to the sound of Gregory's arrangements, which typically fill in the emotional range of the songs with melodic counterpoints and sonic detail. ""Melancholy Sky"", one of the two new tracks on this compilation, is a prime example, with Alison's voice limited to minimalist phrasing as Gregory's synth-heavy orchestration climaxes like a fireworks display. Both of the new cuts call back to their delicate, loungey debut, Felt Mountain, but Gregory's approach has evolved with time, integrating elements of each record along the way. These songs may be a deliberate move to come full circle at the end of this retrospective set, but they could just as well point to a future in which the duo can comfortably let all aspects of its sound coexist on one record, as they do on this collection.","Goldfrapp boils down their catalog to their 12 most successful singles and adds two new tracks, resulting in a tight set of their finest material sequenced like a dynamic, eclectic pop album.

"Out of Sight, Out of Town",Standard Fare,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35aea9e61561daa6a9e/1:1/w_160/a1a42ca6.jpeg,2012-02-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16254-standard-fare-out-of-sight-out-of-town/,MelodicThee Sheffield,"On their promising debut, The Noyelle Beat, the young Sheffield trio Standard Fare struggled to nail a wobbly sound, one that veered between wide-eyed Rainer Maria emo and tart-tongued, caffeinated indie pop. I saw them at New York City's Cake Shop, ground zero for still-forming indie pop bands, and they were bursting with energy that didn't quite make it into their record. The album's highlights-- ""Fifteen (Nothing Happened)"", in which lead singer and bassist Emma Kupa struggled mightily with her temptation to sleep with a 15-year-old, or ""Philadelphia"", where she waited a year to revisit an overseas fling in the titular city-- hit upon an acidic, wide-eyed middle ground. One their stellar, charming follow-up, they sound like a band who has figured exactly how to braid together the different corners of their record collection. Their secret weapon, undoubtedly, is Kupa. Her voice is an endearingly sideways yowl, one that often finishes lines on an unexpected upward lilt. She also has a disarming way of expressing her nerdiness and horniness in the same awkward, honest breath. ""I can see it in your eyes, my eagerness is showing,"" she laments in ""051107"", a line that more or less encapsulates her blurting, clammy-hands appeal. ""Older Women"" is about just that: ""I hear you're into older women/ Do you know what you're doing/ When you take them on?"" she demands. She comes off like someone's older-than-you-think little sister, squirmy but direct about sex. She has refined her songwriting voice from The Noyelle Beat, as well, so that no songs on this wry, sprightly album fail to keep the momentum. Kupa has a distinctly British-songwriter knack for lacing lyrics with hyper-specific information: ""Half Sister"" begins with, ""It must have been 20 years since I last saw you/ Throwing up Cherry-Aide in my father's car/ Now I find out you're living four streets down/ From your grandmother's Christmas cards,” and like a great Ray Davies song, you can feel whole lives sketched out in a few plainspoken lines. The seamless verse-chorus-verse transitions that mark ""Suitcase"", ""Dead Future"", and ""Kicking Puddles"", meanwhile, mark some of the band's most assured songwriting. Standard Fare have gained some welcome horsepower, too: There's nothing ""ramshackle"" about the wildly zig-zagging bass line that darts through ""Bad Temper"", or the genuinely ripshit guitar solo that erupts two-thirds of the way through ""Suitcase"". The album is exuberant, neatly sequenced, and over in about half an hour: a modest joy, but great indie pop is an accumulation of modest joys. Out of Sight, Out of Town is, in fact, great indie pop: It's also the first encouraging sign of a career band hitting its stride.","On this Sheffield indie pop trio's charming sophomore album, Emma Kupa and co. have figured out how to braid together the different corners of their record collection.

After the Graveyard / Clear Skies Over Black River,Liam the Younger,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3695e6ef9596932245a/1:1/w_160/fbb1002a.jpeg,2012-02-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16263-after-the-graveyard-clear-skies-over-black-river/,Underwater Peoples,"If it's the aim of folk music to favor the song over the singer, Liam the Younger-- né Liam Betson, occasional guitarist with Jersey caterwaulers Titus Andronicus-- is making folk music. After the Graveyard and Clear Skies Over Black River-- two early home-recorded, self-distributed works from Betson-- find him singing in an unadorned voice over steady, sustaining strums, shooting for relatable, plainspoken truth with every word. One doesn't always get the strongest sense of Betson the person through his tales of strip malls and cemeteries, close friends and faroff train whistles; at times, it seems his adornment-averse songs of permanence, of comings and goings, and of not wasting what little time you've got on earth are singing through him, rather than the other way around. A few minutes longer and several shades ricketier, After the Graveyard begins with a whorl of ambient noise before Betson starts in with the strumming. Instrumentally, he largely adopts the ardent chug of Woody Guthrie, often opting to leave it at that; the resolute simplicity of this musical backdrop puts the focus squarely on his words, many of which he delivers in an intentionally guileless Guthrie-style ramble. Here, as on Clear Skies, Betson's channeling everyone from Libba Cotten to Conor Oberst, but indie rock's typical anxiety of influence doesn't really factor in here; these songs mean to be part of a tradition that goes well beyond Woody, and Betson does a fine job staying mindful of the past while placing his anxieties squarely in the present. ""Ode to Then"" contrasts ""the strip malls [and] the city halls"" with an ""old dusty road, riding trains, Old Tom Joad,"" later noting that ""one day the internet will be our version of the wild west."" Fundamentally an optimist, Betson seems to be suggesting, in his so-called ""songs of my home and songs of my friends,"" that things aren't really all that different now from the way they've ever been; we could just stand to find a few new ways of looking at them. Clear Skies Over Black River builds on the successes of Graveyard, with a cleaner sound and a more surefooted approach. Dialing back on the doubling-up Betson gave to many of the guitar-and-vocal lines on Graveyard, Clear Skies is played with a stark intimacy, often just Betson, his guitar, and echoes off the wall of his bedrooms. He's still hanging around tombstones, still singing about the place where the past meets the present, and still in an everyman's voice that suggests a serious lack of ego. But the stark, striking Clear Skies finds him developing a voice that speaks to a very particular kind of existential angst, that feeling where you know things should be better than they are but can't quite articulate why. On the haunting, Microphones-like highlight ""Cooking"" he asks, ""how can I live my life if I can't cook my own food?"" Sounding positively devastated by the prospect of never quite mastering Easy Mac, Betson's articulating his need for community, for support; later in the same song, he talks of changing around pronouns so there's no he, no she, just I. That old we-are-one, ""Kumbaya"" feeling? It's not quite that, but it's awfully close. Betson reportedly kept Graveyard and Clear Skies mostly to himself before finally letting a few copies into the hands of friends. Listening to either, it's understandable; though not ""deeply personal"" in the typical bedroom-bloodlet fashion, these are rather revealing records, forefronting Betson's often tentative singing voice and his learn-by-doing approach to the 4-track. But these, at their heart, are songs for sharing; they may be laid down simply, but they're not demos, and there's a gathering strength in their stark presentations. Much like his once-and-former bandmate Patrick Stickles, Betson sometimes hits the wrong note to strike the right feeling; not always the easiest listening, perhaps, but never less than honest.","Liam Betson, occasional guitarist with Titus Andronicus, reissues two early home-recorded, self-distributed folk albums in anticipation of his first Liam the Younger studio LP.

"The Oram Tapes, Vol. 1",Daphne Oram,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36513d197565213a925/1:1/w_160/7a805a0c.jpeg,2012-02-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16262-the-oram-tapes-vol-1/,Young American,"Like Léon Theremin, an electro-acoustic pioneer and inventor whom the Soviets put to work developing surveillance technology, Daphne Oram seems like a star-crossed figure-- a visionary tripped up by circumstance and, perhaps, her own eccentricities. But a new anthology of Oram's work, drawn from over 400 tapes she left behind after her death in 2003, helps illuminate the depth and breadth of her legacy, suggesting her career as a kind of parallel history to electronic music's dominant narratives. Oram's idiosyncratic methods and eccentric pursuits suggest the classic profile of the ""outsider"" artist, but she spent much of her career deep inside the system. When she was just 18, in 1943, Oram found work as a studio engineer at the BBC. Her official duties there were often unglamorous, but she took advantage of the studio to pursue her own experiments with magnetic tape and tone generators. The BBC's resources were actually quite meager, at least compared to the studios in European cities like Paris and Cologne, but Oram was resourceful: one story has her gathering all the BBC's tape machines together and working through the night on an electro-acoustic composition, then dismantling the array and putting its components back in their proper places before work the next morning. Magnetic tape was a relatively recent medium, and electronic sound generation was still in its infancy, but Oram already grasped their enormous artistic potential. As she wrote in her 1972 book An Individual Note: Music, Sound, and Electronics, ""In my work I am not concerned with synthesizing orchestral sounds-- we have excellent orchestras for making those sounds. My interest is in making new sounds which are musical."" In 1957, she recorded the first all-electronic composition to be played on the BBC, and in 1958, she finally received funding to open an electronic-music studio, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Oram and her bosses had very different ideas about its purpose. She had imagined a research facility on par with the electronic-music studio at Cologne's NWDR or the Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrete at Paris' RTF, but the BBC was less interested in avant-garde composition than sound effects and background music, regarding the Radiophonic Workshop-- so named to appease the musicians' union and other music departments at the BBC-- as a kind of sci-fi Foley studio. (Indeed, today, the Radiophonic Workshop is best known for the music and sound effects it produced for Doctor Who.) After just one year, Oram left the BBC, setting up her studio in a house in Kent. There, she pursued a range of work, both personal and commissioned, including sound effects for Jack Clayton's 1961 film The Innocents and various television commercials. The commissions, combined with a research grant, helped fund her main project: a home-built apparatus called the Oramics Machine, a combination synthesizer and sequencer that generated sound waves by ""reading"" hand-painted film strips with a reverse-engineered oscilloscope. It looked like a gigantic Meccano contraption, and it was, by all accounts, a tremendously complicated device. What's more, it was a perpetual work in progress, under constant modification; only Oram and the engineers she employed really understood it. It's unclear when she stopped using the machine. By the late 1980s, she told an interviewer that she had moved onto working with computers, although she remained intent upon designing a system to read hand-drawn inputs. She suffered a series of strokes in the 1990s, and she died in 2003. The Oramics Machine was left gathering cobwebs in Tower Folly, which fell into ruin. The Oramics Machine was recently restored for the London Science Museum's exhibition Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music, coinciding with a growing re-appreciation of her work. But no matter how much biographical detail comes to light, Oram and her work remain shrouded in mystery. This first volume of The Oram Tapes, compiled from a trove of over 400 tapes held by Goldsmiths College, reinforces that impression. Where 2007's Oramics 2xCD set brought together the quixotic warbles of her Oramics compositions with quirky genre studies and commercial commissions-- sound effects, advertisements for Lego and power tools-- this release emphasizes her darker, more minimalist and abstract sounds. Across 44 tracks, the album is by turns hypnotic and jarring, veering from sinewy drones, suggestive of Kevin Drumm, to pieces that sound like icicles being cleared from the eaves of a wind-chime factory. The prevailing mood is dank and claustrophobic, however, fogged with clammy reverb and bristling with strange clicks and alien voices. It sounds as futuristic as it did then, but don't expect hi-fi: despite mastering by renowned Berlin's Dubplates & Mastering facility, the audio can be murky. It's not hard to believe that the original tapes lay moldering in a box for years before their restoration. But that sense of decay actually contributes to the emotional resonance of the music. There's a veiled quality to much of it, and a sense that there's so much more there than meets the ear, as frequencies melt into the ether. The anthology is thin on data; few of the tracks have dates attached, and there's little information on what Oram was using to make a particular piece-- or even why. Experiments with pulse and delay rub up against musical sketches, spoken descriptions, even a recording of a baby's birth. Two tracks titled ""2001 Effects Tape"" were presumably intended as submissions to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. It all raises the question of how much of this Oram intended as music, and how much the tracks are simply fragments of her work, sketches torn from a notebook. But the compilers have made the most of the jumbled source material. In the liner notes, they write, ""As most of the tapes in the archive contain limited factual information, descriptions or dates, a chronological assessment of Oram's work was impossible to present. It is for this reason that we chose to arrange the tracklisting with an emotional narrative in mind, as albums are often sequenced."" They've succeeded here. Purely as a listening experience, it's wonderful. I've had it playing on nearly constant repeat during days of below-freezing temperatures in Berlin, and there are times when I can't decide if the music is the perfect complement to the climate or vice versa. It's both gripping and distracting, fading into the background and then jumping back out at you. In the few segments where Oram speaks, detailing her craft, it feels less like an archival document than a kind of relic, a spectral emanation. Recalling the early belief in the phonograph as a spirit medium, and keeping in mind Oram's own esoteric interests-- she began An Individual Note by suggesting that ""memory, music and magnetism will lead us towards meta-physics""-- only reinforces the idea that there's something truly auratic humming in the grooves. In an Invisibile Jukebox feature in The Wire, People Like Us' Vicki Bennett said of Oram, ""A lot of her music has got a melancholy to it. It's like a sad machine that exists on its own planet and just sings to itself."" That likely has something to do with the way that Oram was tuned to her own, unique frequency, resonating at a pitch inaudible to few others in her time. The Oram Tapes reinforces the melancholy aspect of her work, but it also offers a kind of solace, drawing her planet closer to ours, and finally finding an audience for her one-of-a-kind music.","Reinforcing the melancholy aspect of her work, this dark 44-track anthology of work by pioneering British electronic composer Daphne Oram draws from over 400 tapes she left behind after her death in 2003.

Live From the Kitchen,Yo Gotti,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36b13d197565213a931/1:1/w_160/09e34b86.jpeg,2012-02-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16266-live-from-the-kitchen/,RCAPolo Grounds,"Memphis' Yo Gotti is the latest subject in the rap industry's ongoing, long-term study: If an album is released in a Best Buy and no one is around to purchase it, does it exist? As it pertains to Live From the Kitchen-- the rapper's first major-label album, despite having been in the game for over a decade-- the answer might as well be no. To be fair, 16,000 people bought it in its first week, but amongst his fans, there's little doubt that Live instantly took a backseat to the mixtapes and tracks that preceded it. That's something close to a shame, because it's a solid, listenable, blue-collar rap album, the sort of thing that used to start careers as opposed to branding them dead on arrival. Live From the Kitchen sounds like a professionally mastered mixtape, which explains why it succeeds artistically while failing commercially. On the one hand, Gotti stays in his lane, repeating the textbook trap music that he's been pumping out for years with slight updates from producers du jour like Lil Lody and Mike Will. On the other, the updates are very slight, and any of these songs could be dropped into an installment of Gotti's Cocaine Music mixtape series without anyone being the wiser-- it's hard to expect many people to pay for something that they've routinely been given for free over the course of a few years. It is that consistency that is Gotti's calling card, and he carries it over to Live From the Kitchen with ease. He is a classic example of a rapper succeeding as much for how he sounds when saying something as opposed to what he says, but his lyrics have a striking directness that has allowed him to build the type of grassroots fanbase that can serve as a livelihood, even if they don't show up to retail stores. ""Testimony"", the album's opening track, is a perfect example: Not only does Gotti sound inherently right over DJ Montay's synth horns, but the outlining of his upbringing as a street dealer features no hint of braggadocio or cinematic theatrics. The tone isn't as much somber as it is unflinchingly matter-of-fact, which is an approach that still holds its appeal even during the reign of Rick Ross. But the corollary here is that, although Gotti can easily work off of this blueprint, he rarely, if ever, transcends it. As far as dealers-turned-rappers go, there's a reason why he has never reached the heights of T.I. or Young Jeezy or Gucci Mane. He has neither the personality nor the pop instincts of those guys, and that becomes a problem over the course of a full-length. Tracks like ""Harder"" and ""Cases"" are perfectly fine Southern rap records, but for the top songs on the album, they're distinctly void of anything that would make them standout amongst a deluge of similar-sounding songs that flood the market on a routine basis. Maybe the fate of Live From the Kitchen-- which, just to really hammer it home, had its lead single released in May of 2009-- is merely illustrative of the industry being the survival of the fittest. But it's hard not to sympathize a bit with Yo Gotti, who willingly entered into the major-label system because, well, that's just what rappers do, even though his fate seemed more or less preordained from the start. His debut album as a ""rap star"" will be followed by many mixtapes that sound just like it and are basically just as good, but unfortunately for him, that works out way better for the listener than it does the artist.","After a decade in the game, the Memphis rapper releases his first major-label album.

Le Voyage Dans la Lune,Air,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35b13d197565213a915/1:1/w_160/93d62019.jpeg,2012-02-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16255-le-voyage-dans-la-lune/,Astralwerks,"Notions of cool figure strongly in the world of Jean-Bénoit Dunckel and Nicolas Godin of Air. ""Philip Glass is really harmonious to me: the harmonies are really simple, really amazing, really cool,"" said Dunckel, in a recent interview with the pair for Pitchfork's 5-10-15-20 series. ""They were using guitars and bass but in a mechanical way, as if they were using a sequencer,"" said Godin, of the Strokes' first album, before adding: ""That was very cool."" The members of Air have always been immaculately turned-out, both in person and on record. Their music rarely has a hair out of place. Sometimes this works in their favor. The impeccably shaved-down prog tendencies of ""How Does It Make You Feel?"" from 10,000 Hz Legend shows how effective it can be to take the wilder whims of a genre and thoroughly de-clutter them. That sense of nonchalance, executed with total control, has long been Air's M.O. It's a kind of stoicism shared with artists like Ron Mael of Sparks and Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys.-- a rigid, and admirable, commitment to a singular strain of projected being. When Portishead became a coffee-table favorite, they disappeared for years, overhauling their sound with the jagged lines of Third. Air went in the other direction. They were too locked-down in the detached journey they were committed to, resulting in bland and dispassionate albums like 2009's Love 2. This record, a soundtrack to the restored, hand-colored version of the classic Georges Méliès silent film Le Voyage Dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon), is a diversion of sorts. It offers Air a chance to bring some of the artistry back into their music, to work at rediscovering the elegance within the sleek surface drift they often lackadaisically flop into. Le Voyage Dans la Lune is less light than its predecessor. There's a brawny thickness to the guitar line in ""Astronomic Club"", a spine-tickling ghostliness passing through ""Décollage"", a pile-up of electronics marching with resolve on ""Sonic Armada"". It's never less studied than Dunckel and Godin's prior work, but it feels like Méliès' imagery may have inspired them to rediscover the playful side of their personalities-- the side that once prompted them to release a remix album titled Everybody Hertz. By the time they got to Love 2, the understated joy of songs like ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" had all but vanished, replaced by vapid and overly serious stodge like ""So Light Is Her Footfall"". After coasting in half-realized bliss for so long, Dunckel and Godin appear to be reaching into the past in order to go forward. In the 5-10-15-20 interview, Godin talks about the curse of making ""shit records"" after you turn 40. Here, his coping mechanism for that, on a handful of tracks, at least, is to pluck a few ideas from the playful Air on prior records. ""Parade"" is all bright Paddy Kingsland-inspired analog synth bursts, chirping birdsong, and ruptured drum parts that bring the track to a stuttering halt. But it's a retrogressive step, something this band has done before but better, fuller, and with a greater sense of direction. Here, it feels like a pleasant yet unremarkable switch back to the past, the sound of Air staring into a half-empty well of ideas, on the verge of becoming their own tribute band. It's a shame, because the collaboration with Victoria Legrand of Beach House on ""Seven Stars"" seemed to bode well for this album. The percussion-heavy frame provides the edge that prevents the softer intonations from becoming too fluffy. There's a marrying of militaristic thrust, snug vocal cooing, and a gloriously silly spoken-word countdown halfway through. For a minute it feels as if there are a few cracks in the veneer, which is generally the space from which all the best Air material's gathered. When they lower their guard and open their music up to unexpected elements, it causes the professorial approach to melt away. It makes sense that Dunckel was a mathematics teacher. Air's songs often sound like formulas spread out upon a page, with its makers puzzling over them, trying to figure out why they don't quite add up. Elsewhere, Le Voyage Dans la Lune is an unsteady mixture of partially inspired notions reaching for a purpose. It's a bountiful collection of loose ideas, hanging in the breeze without forging forward in any meaningful direction. ""Who Am I Now?"" is representative of the problem, with Au Revoir Simone providing nebulous vocals that touch on the kind of spectral folk the Ghost Box label so effectively delivers. But this feels like a facsimile of that work, and a poorly made one at that. It's too calculated, too studious. It's music reduced down to its raw components with all the mystery torn out. There are parts of the record that get back to the potential this band once possessed-- a slight return to interlacing all the best parts of Moog demonstration records, hoary old prog moves, and extravagantly deluxe production techniques. But back then they made it seem so easy. Here, it feels like they're trying too hard.","Air's soundtrack to the restored version of Georges Méliès silent film Le Voyage Dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) finds the duo trying to bring some artistry back into their music.

Feel the Sound,Imperial Teen,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3629d034d5c69bf4ce0/1:1/w_160/0c93cd45.jpeg,2012-02-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16260-feel-the-sound/,Merge,"At this point, Imperial Teen's brand of sweet, boisterous pop has been confined to indie's fringes, but the band seems perfectly content to do its own thing in perpetuity and impervious to fashion. The time when Imperial Teen's music could have been considered sellable to America's radio suits, that late-1990s moment when alt-rock shrugged off grunge gloom for gloss and smiles, feels like it happened in another lifetime. As for all of the sounds that have come and gone in indie-land since-- from garage-rock revival to dance-punk to whatever the hell we're calling chillwave in the post-mortem period-- they might as well not have happened in Imperial Teen's world. This dogged insularity in the face of indie's endless trend-hopping is essentially a good thing, even if you have to be down with Imperial Teen's basic routine of slick and déjà vu inducing power-pop hooks, oveer-sugared harmonies, and immediately sing-alongable choruses to need more than one record. And ""routine"" is the right word here, even if I don't mean it as an insult. Following the band's relaxed, ""let's put out an album every four or five years for fun"" release schedule, the new Feel the Sound is sunny and bubbly, but the bulk of these songs follow a very specific template with the rigor of any furrow-browed academic composer. A steady bubblegum beat, somewhere between ABBA in motorik mode and the Archies-go-C86, sets things up. Soft vocals, sometimes harmonizing in time-honored indie pop tradition and sometimes solo, carry us through a low-key verse. Then comes the explosive, joyful chorus. Repeat a handful of times, and we're out. Feel the Sound does its best to keep things varied by once again stretching beyond the stripped-down DIY guitar jangle of vintage indie pop. Imperial Teen haven't lost their knack for shining up these simple and familiar forms with careful (but not suffocating) ornamentation. And true, things get a little darker in the album's middle stretch. But since this is Imperial Teen, we're talking a rather gentle and non-threatening brand of darkness. ""Over His Head"" had me imagining a world where Sarah Cracknell joined a Cure tribute band rather than Saint Etienne, their lone single winding up on a K-Tel compilation of moody goth-pop classics, and ""Hanging About"" catches a similar vibe, where pensive post-punk takes the proverbial chill pill. For the most part, though, from robotic-but-rambunctious opener ""Runaway"" to the late-album one-two closing swoon of ""It's You"" and ""Overtaken"", Feel the Sound leans on Imperial Teen's puppyish charm and love for soft-rock's smooth bliss. The rock songs are revved-up but not macho. The ballads are written by folks who've studied the songs of 1960s and 1970s greats rather than smearing a bunch of feedback over some weedy purloined hooks. And yet, despite their tendency toward pop formalism, Imperial Teen are hardly the Ramones, and Feel the Sound's got plenty of variety even within its own rather strict songwriting guidelines. It's not going to surprise anyone, least of all longtime fans, but it's not like there are dozens of similar acts around at the moment demanding your attention. And indie pop's current lesser lights usually lack for Imperial Teen's care and craft, two aspects not to be knocked when dealing with the restrictions of the old verse-chorus-verse. Imperial Teen know what they like, are content to do it well, and there's still more pleasure in that than next-big-thing culture often lets on.","The longtime San Francisco quartet's fifth album showcases a care and craft usually lacking in indie pop's lesser lights.

Planet High School,Mux Mool,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34c9d034d5c69bf4cbc/1:1/w_160/d71b2c11.jpeg,2012-02-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16242-mux-mool-planet-high-school/,Ghostly,"Mux Mool's 2010 debut full-length, Skulltaste, held the promise of a whatever-works adventurer who could excel in just about any direction he was pointed. It was easy to assume after the fact that if Brian Lindgren focused on just one of his strengths-- Americanized French touch, fat-bottomed analog hip-hop, gauzy-yet-speaker-rattling downtempo ambient-- he could produce the next phase of a defining sound with real mutation potential. Planet High School narrows his scope and draws a more specific target, streamlining those aforementioned touchstones into a blend of synthesized airiness and thick bass that sounds a bit like g-funk for planetariums. But as with his best tracks, the common thread that runs through each song is a sense of restless metamorphosis, the sense that there's no use wearing out a good loop when there's plenty of space to throw it around. There's a confident immediacy to the beats that initially drive them-- whether agitatedly hopped-up (""Raw Gore"", ""Cash for Gold"") or floating at cruising speed (""Ruin Everything"", ""Palace Chalice"")-- and Lindgren gives himself the space to jostle and upend their structures in freewheeling ways. There are so many rhythmic and melodic layers to each track that he often produces attention-getting dynamics just by fiddling with one of the elements, dropping in or pulling out a bassline's notes to shift momentum without losing tempo, or pushing a deceptively simple drum break into supple polyrhythms. It's not just about waiting for big drops or build-build-build-release catharsis; it's about constructing a track that ricochets inside itself, splits, regroups, and counteracts itself several times in just a few bars without once losing grasp of its own forward movement. It's undeniably danceable, but the pop-and-lock routines you could set to this might tear ACLs. It's when Lindgren tries to accelerate too far into frenetic overload that things start shaking apart. There are only three cuts of 10 that let the works go spiraling uncontrolled into the grandstands, but they're pretty confounding, trading off manic glitchiness and bewildering juxtapositions that upend what could have been a more naturalistic flow. ""Get Yer Alphabets (Guns)"" is the grimiest, threatening bro-step wobbles and hiccup-spasm snares before settling on a warbly Squarepusher-ish bassline that doesn't quite lend itself to nuanced manipulation-- so it gets Benihana'd into an Adderall freakout instead. ""Live at 7-11"" sabotages its hypnotic, swooning funk halfway through for a series of drum'n'bass crescendos that border on non-sequitur, then peters into a woozy, tacked-on codeine keyboard coda. And ""The Butterfly Technique"" tries to do for lo-fi samples what the other tracks did for thick analog sounds, but if you can get past the stuck-doorbell intro and a frantic, piano-driven attempt to grasp on to some semblance of groove, you're still dealing with a pile-up of sounds that don't quite mesh. So maybe Mux Mool can't literally do everything-- but for the bulk of Planet High School, he's got himself an engaging something.","The adventurous Brooklyn-via-Minneapolis DJ/producer Brian Lindgren streamlines the touchstones of his 2010 debut on his freewheeling sophomore LP.

"The Black Session: Paris, 10 May 2011",Wire,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35d13d197565213a91a/1:1/w_160/37a8dd2f.jpeg,2012-02-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16257-wire-the-black-session-paris-10-may-2011/,Pinkflag,"Thirty-five years into their start-and-stop career, Wire are not short on live albums. This is the 15th they've released since 2004 through their own Pinkflag imprint, covering all three incarnations of the band: the brittle, brainy punks who hurtled artward from 1976 to 1980, the poppy, brainy ""beat-combo"" that branched out toward both alternative radio tunes and monomaniacal hammer-drone from 1985 to 1992, and the tough, brainy old guys who reconvened in 2000 and have been bearing down hard ever since. But the only really significant live Wire discs are the out-of-print Document and Eyewitness-- a bootleg-quality set centered on an abrasive 1980 gig that featured almost entirely new material-- and 1989's It's Beginning to and Back Again, which was so heavily reworked in the studio that it's barely a live album at all. That shortlist hasn't changed with the new addition to the pile. The formal distinction of The Black Session is that it's the first recording to feature Wire's most recent stage lineup. (For those who haven't been following closely, founding guitarist Bruce Gilbert left in the mid-2000s; Margaret Fielder McGinnis of Laika replaced him on tour for a few years, and, since 2010, Matt Simms has augmented the remaining trio of original members on tour.) The days when Wire would turn up for gigs with a set of material the audience had never heard before, or save the throwbacks for the encore, are behind them. At this gig, they run through the better part of 2011's Red Barked Tree, basically ignore everything else from the past 24 years except for 2002's hardcore-velocity ""Comet"", and toss in a couple of old favorites. It's particularly unsettling to hear ""Map Ref. 41ºN 93ºW"", one of their most precisely constructed studio singles, in a sloppy garage-band rendition-- metronomic drummer Robert Grey struggles to keep the tempo steady, and singer/guitarist Colin Newman sounds uncomfortably exposed when nobody joins him for harmonies on the chorus. The final encore is one that rejoined their repertoire in 2000 and stayed there: ""Pink Flag"", with its original two-chord structure replaced by a single blaring E chord at which they hammer for seven minutes or so until it disintegrates into end-of-show chaos. For Wirephiles, the value of The Black Session is the live treatments of the Red Barked Tree tracks. As elegantly textured as that album was, it also sounded reserved and unconvinced in places, and tried to pass off some old Wire ideas as new ones. These versions have more fire and bite to them, even on slow numbers like ""Down to This"" and ""Adapt"", and the band has rearranged ""Clay"" to not sound quite so much like a faint carbon copy of 1978's ""I Am the Fly"". There's no getting over the resemblance of ""Moreover"" to Wire's 1979 single ""A Question of Degree"", but it's mostly an excuse for them to stomp hard, and for Simms and Newman to contrast a tightly wound little riff with a high-pressure spray of noise. In the context of Wire's catalog, this is just another document of incremental change, and not even the best live recording they've made lately (that would be their gorgeous Daytrotter session from 2008). Still, if this were the only Wire record in existence-- a debut album by a new quartet, three of them in their late 50s, captured live on French radio-- it'd be bracingly new even in 2012, an original take on punk minimalism, guitar sound, singing technique, tunefulness vs. dissonance, and so on. ""My God! They're so gifted!"" Newman yells in ""Two People in a Room"", and as usual he could be referring to himself and his collaborators.","This fiery live recording, the first to feature Wire's most recent stage lineup, focuses on the elegantly textured 2011 collection Red Barked Tree.

Blues Funeral,Mark Lanegan Band,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b359c0084474cd0c20ee/1:1/w_160/b1df9858.jpeg,2012-02-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16253-blues-funeral/,4AD,"If you value melody and visceral thrills as a listener, it must be weird to see critics engage with the latest Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and Leonard Cohen records as if they're park rangers describing protected national treasures-- they tend to speak solely in terms of topography, remarking upon jagged outcroppings and bottomless lodes of capital-t Truth hidden in those crevasses created by years of erosion from hard living and hard liquor. Me, I don't necessarily give growling old white men the presumption of wisdom. Point being that even though Mark Lanegan will be all but grandfathered into that Hall of Fame in 20 years and will look swarthy in men's magazines proclaiming Blues Funeral to be the testosterone-boosting antidote to wimpy indie rock and fashionista hip-hop, he has every bit the obligation to avoid cliché and actually come up with good songs as everybody else. Can an album named Blues Funeral, of all things, actually make good on that? Unfortunately, it's closer to something like Machete, where the majority of the pleasure was derived from seeing grizzled and badass charcter actor Danny Trejo doing grizzled and badass things in a lead role, plot or character development be damned. But then again, that voice. It really is something to behold-- while the aforementioned greats have vocals that are nearly utilitarian in function, worn down to an essentialist nub, Lanegan's is as lustrous, supple, and thoroughly American as a well-oiled baseball mitt. When given the proper material-- which in the past has often come from wisely chosen collaborators such as Greg Dulli, Isobel Campbell, Josh Homme, and PJ Harvey-- the results are almost invariably powerful on a sheer physical level. Do lyrics like, ""With piranha teeth/ I've been dreamin' of you,"" sound any less ridiculous than they look on paper? Not really, but it's the impossibly thick riffs and Jack Irons' feral drumming that drives ""The Gravedigger's Song"" toward Queens of the Stone Age's hot zone between the monster-truck muscle and race-car seduction. Lanegan doesn't stay in there long. Based on title alone, it's tough to associate ""Bleeding Muddy Water"" with any word besides ""turgid,"" but the six minutes of the song itself, much of which finds Lanegan leaning hard on a line like ""loooooord, now the rain done come"" without creating context for its payoff, is more than content to follow suit, becoming one of Blues Funeral's many dirges that simply drag. But even the more uptempo material is hamstrung by strangely dated production that makes it come off like one of those ""genre bending"" roots rock albums from 1999 that tried to incorporate electronica and hip-hop touches. As a result, Blues Funeral sounds adrift both sonically and lyrically, chippy drum machines and oozing synths backing Lanegan's verbal merry-go-round of rising suns, avenging gods, and pitiless oceans. Something like the crawling blooze of ""St. Louis Elegy"" should be hard as nails, and its chorus of, ""If tears were liquor/ I'd have drunk myself sick,"" tries to get there. But it's an exemplary Lanegan lyric in how repetition reveals its inherent clumsiness rather than depth. And while mentions of whisky are never too far away from descriptions of Lanegan's output, amidst the pumped-up kick drums and soloing guitars that never stop once during ""Riot in My House"", you feel like some retired NFL coach is about to give you a lecture on the significance of widemouth cans and frost brew liners. Though a mixed bag, Blues Funeral does have its moments: ""Ode to Sad Disco"" is ostensibly the furthest stretch for Lanegan, a chintzy New Romantic backing that immediately recalls Erasure's ""Chains of Love"" and flows easily where the similarly lengthy epics on Blues Funeral buckle under their own assumed weight. As a song, it's nothing amazing, but more important is the acknowledgement that it ""works."" Weirdly, the less overt the stunt casting, the more awkward it sounds: ""Harborview Hospital"" and ""Deep Black Vanishing Train"" have seemingly the most personal and poetic lyrics on Blues Funeral, but their dime-thin orchestral arrangements hew closer to Collective Soul's ""Run"" than resonance. And while ""Quiver Syndrome"" isn't too far away from the Brit Invasion bands that influenced Screaming Trees, it's the one time Lanegan is simply overwhelmed by the jet-setter production: Competing with disembodied female ""ooh-oohs"" and laser-light sound effects, Lanegan huffs, ""The moon don't smile on Saturday's child/ Lyin' still in Elysian fields/ I don't know what the doctor he did/ Now I'm all day long with my body in bed,"" like a winded Lizard King, proof that surrealistic nonsense can become its own kind of cliché. Lanegan recently gave an interview to the Quietus where he namedropped albums by the Bee Gees, Kraftwerk, Joy Division, and the Gun Club as lifelong influences-- while it humanizes Lanegan in a way his obtuse and daunting lyrics rarely attempt to, it also makes you wish he went even further on Blues Funeral, so it could risk spectacular failure rather than mild disappointment. Indeed, Blues Funeral isn't ever bad per se, or even unlistenable. But back on Screaming Trees' 1996 album Dust, Lanegan sang, ""all along, I've been a traveler,"" and while he's done an often-admirable job of embodying that mission statement, the drifter isn't so compelling when they sound as directionless as he does here*.*","Citing albums by Kraftwerk, Joy Division, and Roxy Music as influences, the Gutter Twins/ex-Screaming Trees vocalist's first solo album since 2004 incorporates drum machines and oozing synths into the mix.

ƒIN,John Talabot,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b355c0084474cd0c20e8/1:1/w_160/23716cd0.jpg,2012-02-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16249-fin/,Permanent Vacation,"When the Irish techno producer Donnacha Costello released his debut album, Growing Up in Public, its title crystallized a key dilemma of any emerging artist: At what point do you decide you're ready to venture out of the bedroom? That was back in 2000, well before the internet had shifted into high gear; since then, the coming-out process has gotten only harder. Barcelona's John Talabot and his first album, ƒIN, make for an interesting case study of the musical debutant: This is actually the artist's second time around. Under a different alias, as a resident DJ at one of Barcelona's techno institutions, he began his recording career in the mid 2000s, making punchy, melodic dance music with a clear debt to labels such as BPitch Control and Border Community. A few years later, around the same time that Barcelona's techno scene and the styles that fueled it began to go stale, his own productions began to shift. He eased into a mid-tempo chug and set aside buzzing synthesizers in favor of sun-bleached samples, trading neon fizz for dandelion fluff. Like a company de-listing itself from the stock market, the local fixture took himself private, assuming a new alias and wiping the slate clean. It was a smart move. In the past two years, Talabot has become an exemplar of a new breed of producers working at the intersection of deep house, disco, and indie pop, and he has carved out his own niche somewhere between the slow-motion theatrics of artists such as Mark E and Tensnake, the globe-trotting jewel tones of Four Tet and Caribou, and the psych-pop rush of Animal Collective and Delorean. Having interviewed him a few times, I don't think there's a calculating bone in the-artist-currently-known-as-John-Talabot's body, but he has nevertheless benefited from being in the right place at the right time. His slow tempos, supersaturated colors, and tropical accents fit right in with the woozy, humid dance music that's currently in vogue, and he has found himself in esteemed company-- remixing the xx, recruiting Glasser's Cameron Mesirow for guest vocals, and releasing on Young Turks. He's currently on tour in Australia with SBTRKT, another indicator that his star is on the rise. Ironically, this all means that, his quasi-anonymity aside, Talabot finds himself growing up in public all over again as he graduates from singles and remixes to the full-length album form. Perhaps it's those raised stakes that make ƒIN feel like such a triumph. Across the album's 11 tracks, Talabot builds upon his distinctive sound-- bursting with color, nostalgic but never retro, easy-going yet slightly unhinged-- without repeating himself. Talabot's early singles tended to follow a single trajectory, beginning with a bed of chunky percussion and then piling on loops of acoustic guitars, Philly strings, and soaring, pitched-up voices, usually culminating in a swollen, almost over-the-top climax. He hasn't entirely abandoned that approach, but he hasn't remained shackled to it, partly because he has shortened his track times considerably: Where his singles and remixes routinely ran seven, eight, even nine minutes, most of ƒIN's tracks come in around the four-minute mark, giving him the opportunity to experiment with more modest ideas that say their piece and move on. The album's first three songs show off his range. The opening ""Depak Ine""-- at seven-and-a-half minutes, it's the LP's longest cut-- is disco by way of Depeche Mode, with stabbing synths, eerie vocal samples, and an inexplicable chorus of croaking frogs. (The title resembles the brand name of a mood-stabilizing drug, which might explain the shift from minor to major halfway through; perhaps the frogs denote side effects?) ""Destiny"", a co-production with Madrid's Pional, is one of the album's obvious standouts, with beautifully harmonized vocals over lilting Caribbean chimes and a cozy, reassuring chord progression. Then, like a kind of palate cleanser, the three-minute ""El Oeste"" is a sleek little miniature of melting synthesizers, scraggly drum machines and dub delay that gradually swells into a folky, Boards of Canada-gone-house vibe. A few times, Talabot tries to recreate the sensation that he nailed on ""Sunshine"", an early hit that was as subtle as an ice-cream headache. With its stabbing chords and sped-up vocal loops, ""When the Past Was Present"" shows Talabot at his excessive best-- buzzing and slightly out of tune, with everything pushed into the red and teetering on the verge of collapse. ""Journeys"", the album's only misstep, goes for the same vibe, but there's something clunky about its construction, and the vocals, from Delorean's Ekhi Lopetegi, can be distractingly pitchy. A kind of happy melancholy informs most of the album, but that unity of mood doesn't get in the way of the songs' potential to surprise. As many times as I listen, I keep discovering new sounds, phrases, and even entire songs that had previously passed me by, such as ""Estiu"", a demure, three-minute funk bumper that sounds like Dâm-Funk on Percoset, or ""Last Land"", whose breakbeat sounds based on the same sample used in Mr. Cheeks' 2001 club-rap hit ""Lights, Camera, Action!"". ƒIN saves its best song for last: ""So Will Be Now..."", another Pional co-production, which loops sampled vocals into a dreamy haze before digging into a sparse, deep-house groove. It's restrained, but there's real power there. A friend raved to me about how the song moved the dance floor at Berlin's Panorama Bar one Sunday morning. On your home speakers, it's as comforting as a lullaby, but played loud, apparently, those stark finger snaps and swooning coos are a call to collective ecstasy. Those contradictory qualities inform the whole record as it luxuriates in the space between private and public, just as its ambiguous title blurs the line between ends and means.","In the past two years, John Talabot has become an exemplar of a new breed of producers working at the intersection of deep house, disco, and indie pop.

Better Luck Next Life,Royal Baths,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b357b1335d7bf169a5a1/1:1/w_160/041934e6.jpg,2012-02-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16251-royal-baths-better-luck-next-life/,Kanine,"The San Francisco garage-psych world isn't a bastion of optimism, but it's a little too sunshiney for Royal Baths. Perhaps that's why the duo moved to Brooklyn ahead of the release of its second full-length, Better Luck Next Life, an album gloomy almost to the point of self-parody. It's nine songs about black souls, black hearts, S&M, and dark lords pounded out over Bo Diddley beats. They don't skimp on the details, either. For Royal Baths, there is no question: The world is a vampire. In the past, Royal Baths' music has been tagged as psychedelic if only because of their geographic proximity to groups like the Fresh & Onlys, Thee Oh Sees, and Ty Segall. But this latest set of songs yields little in the way of incense and peppermints. It's a sludgy, turgid take on the blues, swiping it's chief inspiration from the Velvet Underground but supplementing heavily with sounds from mid-1980s goth rockers like the Gun Club and the Bad Seeds. Each song is a handful of grotty chords strummed on a guitar with every string tuned to the same note. Royal Baths' debut LP, Litanies, was cobbled together in the band's practice space on a Tascam 388, the Bay Area's leading choice for fuzz-tinged DIY-recording. The grotty production imbued their songs-- which were bleak and droney, but eerily twee and melodic-- with an extra edge. This time around, some of the grit is gone. So are the Aleister Crowley-meets-Beat Happening hooks. Whatever pop pretenses Royal Baths harbored, they've mostly let them slide, ditching verse-chorus-verse for static Diddley rhythm tracks that buoy Jigmae Baer's seedy monologues. For a record that concerns itself so heavily with evil, though, Better Luck Next Life is fairly subdued. Baer delivers his lyrics in a reedy, muted tenor that wobbles in and out of key. It's an intentional effect, meant to enhance the music's creep factor by delivering darkness in a disaffected voice, but the blasé attitude makes it harder to buy in. The ecstatic call-and-response aspect of the blues is mostly missing. On ""Burned"", Baer allots himself several minutes to trance out and unwind into the music while Cox pummels his guitar. But most of the songs are just short stories recited over droney chords. And the prose gets a little purple: ""Bloody landscapes are my daydreams, bodies fall/ If I could touch the hem of Satan I would crawl,"" sings Baer on ""Black Sheep"". But you can't quibble with Royal Baths' sincerity. They look the part, for sure. Dressed in shredded paisley hand-me-downs, guitarist Jeremy Cox resembles a zombie-makeup version of Jefferson Airplane's Marty Balin. Their tour ride is a Chevy Suburban spraypainted matte black. They're an iffy live band, but on stage they project their weirder impulses well-- pummeling the audience with feedback, barely hewing to the structures of their songs. On good nights, the band conjures a singularly eerie vibe. But on Better Luck Next Life, it's not always coming through.","The Brooklyn-via-Bay Area garage duo's sludgy, gloomy second LP features songs about black souls, black hearts, S&M, and dark lords pounded out over Bo Diddley beats.

Man With Potential,Pete Swanson,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3539d034d5c69bf4cc6/1:1/w_160/af0c34e9.jpg,2012-02-06 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16247-man-with-potential/,Type,"Pete Swanson has long led a dual life as a noise musician (most famously in the late, lamented duo Yellow Swans) and a social worker helping the homeless and mentally ill. When I asked him last year if he found any connections between those pursuits, he recalled testing a virtual-reality machine that simulates schizophrenic hallucinations. To Swanson, the bombardment of illogical stimuli felt ""psychedelic in the most terrible way""-- and similar to his music. ""There are these elements that [are] very concrete and consistent and musical, and people can latch onto these things,"" he said. ""But then there are all these other things happening-- distortions being introduced, [and] chaotic elements that don't contribute musically, but determine the trajectory of the piece."" That description certainly fits Man With Potential, perhaps more than any other record he's been involved with. The handful of cassettes and LPs he has released since Yellow Swans disbanded in 2008 have had their share of distortion and chaos. But none has offered something this easy to latch onto. It comes in the form of a consistent, prominent beat-- so prominent that some claim Swanson has ""gone techno."" This isn't completely new territory for him, though-- Yellow Swans could drop a heavy beat too, especially on their throbbing 2004 album Bring the Neon War Home. But even that blast of nuclear dance-noise didn't have the insistence and drive of Man With Potential. On most of the tracks, this drive is like a caffeine-infused heartbeat, pumping blood into a mix of buzzing tones, rising waves, and cutting noise. Swanson is usually partial to drones, but here his approach is more precise and almost pointillist, often sounding like a symphony of dot-matrix printers. Swarms of chirps, whirrs, blips, and pops dart and dive around each other, but they're all grounded by a relentless, nerve-affecting pulse. Those words may make Man With Potential seem hyper and frenzied, a blizzard of blinding sound. At times it does feel that way. ""Misery Beat"" opens the album in the midst of panic, pounding and squeaking like Swanson has been sprinting for hours and we're just catching up. But the beat also has a calming effect. It stabilizes what might otherwise be dizzying, like a sedative that makes chaos feel less frightening. It might sound paradoxical, but there really is a meditative aspect to Swanson's flying noise. That's not surprising given his history of infusing all kinds of sounds with Zen-like serenity. In fact, as fun and oddly danceable as these tracks can be, the best are the most rhythmically serene. They're also the noisiest-- the granular grit of ""A&Ox0"" swells into soothing waves, while closer ""Face the Music"" is the album's only slow track, as bass lines rise into something like abstract metal or hardcore New Age. All those adjectives may be a lot to swallow, but on Man With Potential Pete Swanson's ability to encompass many sounds and moods knows few bounds, if any.","Pete Swanson has released a handful of cassette and LPs since his electronic noise duo Yellow Swans disbanded in 2008, but none have offered something this easy-- or oddly danceable-- to latch onto.

Keep it Together,The Doozer,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b351b1335d7bf169a595/1:1/w_160/c9f6b146.jpg,2012-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16245-keep-it-together/,Woodsist,"It seems as if every singer-songwriter with ""weird"" characteristics gets compared to the greats such as Syd Barrett, or even the under-the-radar greats such as Chris Knox. Those comparisons won't be going away anytime soon for Cambridge, UK singer-songwriter the Doozer, though he's abandoned his solo setup and recorded Keep it Together with 11 other musicians. The style of his fourth album is actually far removed from Knox and Barrett. In its grab-bag-orchestra instrumentation and library-quiet charm, the Doozer's songs are more in the realm of Glaswegian twee. Considering the experimental, homespun vibe of the three albums that came before it, Keep it Together's colorful arrangements give it the kind of vibrancy and pop-friendliness his past work was lacking. Opener ""Burning Bright"" shows the newly assembled band putting its best foot forward. Leaning on a sturdy vocal melody, the track goes a long way on a simple chord progression, scattered lyrics suggesting new beginnings, and a buoyant string section. On Keep it Together as a whole, the instruments come together surprisingly well for an artist normally used to a vastly more minimal setup. The songs are often lush and ornate, and for any lover of unconventional instrumentation, there are a few genuine surprises. (Sitar! A tuba reportedly bought from the Salvation Army!) Once the novelty of the added bells and whistles wears off, however, all you have is a pretty-but-boring pop album. Aside from ""Burning Bright"" and ballad ""The Island"", the other songs barely deviate from the same plodding tempo, making the album's 41 minutes seemingly last hours longer. There's rarely a surge in energy or even a mild outburst: The guitars are strummed politely, and the drums are played with brushes. Even the aforementioned tuba loses its luster about halfway through ""Jobsworth"". In graduating from a cast of one to a cast of a dozen, the Doozer not only jettisoned the more challenging aspects of his past albums, he also got rid of what made them interesting. This could be forgiven if he were a more compelling songwriter, but the added to clarity has made his lyrics unbearable to listen to. In trying to sound a little more poignant than your average songwriter with nothing to say, Keep it Together has choruses built on dull motivation (""Fold Up Chair""), simple math (""The Island""), and elementary-school ecology (""Lowest Point""). Half-baked imagery peppers each of its songs: A man carrying a milk jug, a rabbit scurrying around a hutch. Even if finding poignancy in the mundane was the Doozer's task, there are no remarks on why the characters in his songs do what they do; they just do them and are off to the next part of their incredibly average day. There's a sense of mystery that surrounds the Doozer. Because there's almost no information about his personal life, all we have to go on is his pseudonym and the music he's released. Considering the intrigue of his past work, Keep it Together makes a good case for why certain people choose to lead enigmatic lifestyles: Sometimes there's very little going on underneath the surface.","On his ornate, pop-friendly fourth LP, enigmatic UK singer-songwriter the Doozer has abandoned his solo setup and recorded with close to a dozen other musicians.

Onwards to the Wall EP,A Place to Bury Strangers,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35013d197565213a908/1:1/w_160/303f2020.jpg,2012-02-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16244-a-place-to-bury-strangers-onward-to-the-wall/,Dead Oceans,"In November of last year, A Place to Bury Strangers released ""So Far Away"", the first taste from Onwards to the Wall, the follow-up EP to their 2009 sophomore album, Exploding Head. As a song, ""So Far Away"" carried a lot of the same hallmarks of the material that had immediately preceded it, but unlike the screeching, industrial-minded manic power that defined much of their terrifically visceral self-titled debut, it's a groomed, economic kind of song that rounds-off all of the dangerous, splintered ends. More notable was the video that accompanied the track, a sort of ""flipbook"" montage of frontman Oliver Ackermann's own personal Hipstamatic photos, stitched together to create a stop-motion-animation effect, except with real live people and settings. Like rifling through the iPhone of a very busy and well-traveled guy, it's actually a unique, voyeuristic peek into the progression of a person's year, complete with amorous cavorting, gigging, and passenger-side window boredom, all set in some pretty stunning locales. But it should be said that, aside from containing plenty of APTBS-related snaps thrown in the mix, it's not a video that feels terribly representative of Ackermann's band. After a half-decade, A Place to Bury Strangers aren't an act that's allowed their music to do much moving around, and when they have, they've let moodier tendencies prevail. In other words, if the ""Stay Away"" video had solely been a document of APTBS's progression, it wouldn't have been nearly as engaging. Onward to the Wall opens with ""I Lost You"", and while it remains firmly in the band's wheelhouse, it feels indicative of the APTBS that lives in the mind: A pummeling onslaught of of banshee-wail guitar stacked on top of a chugging motorik bass riff, plus some gnarly, rancid feedback. In essence, it's a no-prisoners take that, while nothing new, is welcomingly jarring. It is by far the best of the five tracks offered here, a return-to-form that seems to take the more calculated moves on Exploding Head and re-routes them back in the right direction. Unfortunately, the rest of Onward to the Wall takes even fewer chances than Exploding Head did. The reality begins to set in that, try as they might, this is a band resigned to making ""mature"" post-punk tunes instead of tapping into its live-wire essence. Because when the title track shares more in common with an old She Wants Revenge cut than the slow-lane Dum Dum Girls cut it secretly wants to be, well, we got a problem. In essence, if there's anything to be learned from this EP, it's that the majority of APTBS's career can be chalked up to playing it safe. Which, for a lot of us, is wildly disheartening. It isn't to say there aren't some great little moments tucked in here and there. ""Nothing Will Surprise Me"" brings in bracing cat-in-heat guitar moans over a hardcore backbeat, plus there's the aforementioned ""I Lost You"". But it means we're left with three other tracks that are characterless at best. I've never been too big a fan of Ackermann's goth-y, dead-eyed delivery, but it seems here as if the music is using his vocals as something of a guiding light. It amounts to a mostly homogenous, toothless EP that seems to be aiming for a greater appeal, but ends up appealing very little. Perhaps the most problematic thing about Onward to the Wall is its timing. As the profile of New York City bands making dangerous, abrasive, and loud music becomes increasingly elevated, you can't help but yearn for the APTBS of five years ago. It would've been great to see them help supplement a bill along with the ranks of pig-fuck revivalists, black metal revisionists, and nü-noiseniks. Here, they sound disconnected from what made them so visceral and captivating in the first place, as if they're almost scared to go back. Instead, they've resigned to making more color-by-numbers post punk that uses too many grays and not enough pure blacks, and as time goes on, it feels as if their paint brush water is being incrementally diluted by half.","The New York noise-rock band's followup to 2009's Exploding Head is a five-song EP that seems to aim for a greater appeal.

Paralytic Stalks,Of Montreal,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b356ea9e61561daa6a96/1:1/w_160/822e6471.jpg,2012-02-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16250-paralytic-stalks/,Polyvinyl,"of Montreal are not a band. Or, at least, they haven't been for quite some time: Since 2004's breakthrough sixth full-length, Satanic Panic in the Attic, Kevin Barnes has largely written, recorded, and performed every album on his own, occasionally calling on outside collaborators (Janelle Monaé, Solange Knowles, Jon Brion) to add flourishes. He made the decision to shift toward creative solitude nearly eight years into a career that has now spanned 16, and the decision made sense. Since Satanic Panic, Barnes has treated the LP form as a highly personal forum exploration, a place to indulge his every whim without regard for his audience. In that sense, of Montreal's latest, Paralytic Stalks, is more of the same: Barnes recorded it in his own Sunlandic Studios with the assistance of strings arranger/performer Kishi Bashi and a smattering of session musicians, and has stated that the album is meant to be taken whole. But even for a songwriter as sonically adventurous as Barnes, something feels different this time around. He's always been fond of concepts (2008's alter-ego-happy Skeletal Lamping, the funk freakouts of 2010's False Priest), but on Paralytic Stalks, he sounds completely adrift, as if his thousand-synapses-firing-all-at-once approach finally blew a massive fuse. When I spoke with Barnes this past fall about the influences driving the creation of Paralytic Stalks, he cited difficult 20th-century composers such as Charles Ives and Krzysztof Penderecki, predicting it'd be a hard sell for most listeners before doubling back and referring to it as a ""colorful pop record."" The truth lies somewhere in the middle. It is, without a doubt, his most fragmented album since the tail end of the project's Elephant 6 days, which is saying a lot considering the tiny stitched-together segments made Skeletal Lamping such a challenging, divisive album. To me, that record sounded like a pleasurably jumbled mess of endless possibilities; Paralytic Stalks just sounds like a mess. The seam in Paralytic Stalks' patchwork comes at the midpoint of ""Ye, Renew the Plaintiff"", which delineates the album's two halves. The front half plays to strengths Barnes' has honed over the last eight years-- stuffed production on the brink of exploding, melodies that constantly change direction, and unhinged vocal performances. The hooks just aren't there, though, and that's a big problem, considering that even Barnes' most esoteric records have had their share of memorable take-aways (Skeletal Lamping's ""An Eluardian Instance"", False Priest's ""Our Riotous Defects""). With the possible exception of ""Malefic Dowery"", which is surprisingly lush, little here sticks. The ""20th-century classical music"" influence comes during the album's second half: Its songs run longer, and they're packed with dissonant drones, screeching noise, and, in the case of ""Exorcismic Breeding Knife"", a surging orchestral cacophony. It's challenging stuff, a distant cousin to the kind of abstractions that Barnes flirted with on last year's thecontrollersphere EP. Barnes doesn't go all-in, but rather, pastes bits of psychedelia, stuttering synth-funk, and hushed piano balladry on the ends of ""Wintered Debts"" and ""Authentic Pyrrhic Remission"", which all feels utterly wasted given the shapeless and indistinct surroundings. The most disappointing aspect of Paralytic Stalks is that lack of personality behind the music. Barnes has treated songwriting as a personal therapy session, and the recording studio as a psychologist's couch under mirrored ceilings. On 2007's brilliant Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, he faced off with his super-ego amidst infidelity, depression, and self-destruction; the following year's Skeletal Lamping contained so much him that he needed an alter-ego, the glammy sexpot Georgie Fruit, to get it all out there. The words ""personal"" and ""dark"" have been referenced in Paralytic's promotional lead-up, but without a lyric sheet, it's nearly impossible to tell that Barnes is singing about anything, save for the surprisingly straightforward ""Malefic Dowery"", which goes back to the the subject of infidelity. I don't doubt that this is a personal album for Barnes, but on Hissing Fauna, that was obvious-- all you had to do was listen. Here, we're left sorting through lyrics like, ""True love never mattered/ The two donkey jaws that were removed from our hearing."" It's hard to blame Barnes for being tired. Since the project's 1997 debut, Cherry Peel, of Montreal haven't gone a year without issuing some sort of new material. By now, he's akin to a Steven Soderbergh, an artist so driven to follow his muse that, even in the face of exhaustion, the thought of retirement only spurs him to work more. The thoroughly unenjoyable Paralytic Stalks might be a sign that Barnes should take some time off and let the inspiration come to him.","This is, without a doubt, Kevin Barnes' most fragmented record since the tail end of the project's Elephant 6 days.

The Horror,Pop. 1280,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34dea9e61561daa6a88/1:1/w_160/c4233887.jpeg,2012-02-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16243-pop-1280/,Sacred Bones,"If the hardest thing for a new rock band to do is be original, then the second hardest is to be scary. Most artists deploying horror-movie imagery and shock tactics inevitably succumb to campy theatricality (as seen in everyone from Marilyn Manson to the earliest iteration of the Horrors), or are quick to explain it away as just a ruse (e.g., Odd Future saying they're just joshin' with all that rape-and-murder business), and lest we forget that the most well-worn metaphor used to describe death metal invokes a character from Sesame Street. But the songs that have startled me the most-- Suicide's ""Frankie Teardrop"", Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds' ""Hard-On for Love"", the Jesus Lizard's ""Killer McHann""-- are unnerving to me not so much for their overt aggression as their matter-of-fact realism, where the line between singer and subject is blurred, and sound and fury coalesce into a vivid, very real portrait of violent psychosis. New York foursome Pop. 1280 are not shy about showing their hand-- they take their name from a Jim Thompson crime novel about a killer cop, and they've given their first full-length album the self-explanatory title of The Horror. Pop. 1280 wallow in the same pool of pigfuck sloppy seconds as East Coast contemporaries Pissed Jeans and the Men, but where those bands respectively soften their blows (somewhat) with wry observations about domesticity and knowing classic-rock references, Pop. 1280 offer no such salve. If the ray-gunned synth-punk stylings of the band's debut 2010 EP, The Grid, suggested a certain fondness for cheeky, B-movie thrills, The Horror is a far more traumatic experience, conjuring all the dystopian futurism of an early David Cronenberg film, but delivered with merciless, medieval brute force. The first words we hear on the album are ""two dogs fucking""; it proves to be The Horror's most romantic lyric. Band co-founders Chris Bug and Ivan Lip recorded The Horror with a different drummer and keyboardist from The Grid, and the difference is immediately palpable-- rather than provide a clear separation of bass, synths, and Lip's Birthday Party-esque guitar scrapes, the three elements are often compacted into one monolithic, doomy frequency that hangs over the record like a cloud of black smoke. But new drummer Zach Ziemann does a fine job of pushing the proverbial boulder up the mountain. For all its oppressive heaviness, The Horror has energy and verve to spare: ""Bodies in the Dunes"" sets its apocalyptic death-toll imagery to a heart-racing tribal stomp that doesn't relent for five minutes, while ""New Electronix"" sounds like a summit between 1990s Touch and Go greats Brainiac and Girls Against Boys. Ironically, when Bug starts shouting out explicit dance-move instructions (""Hips to the right/ And hips to the left!"") on ""Nature Boy"", the song's convulsing groove slows to a sludgy grind, making his directives sound less like an invitation to shimmy than militaristic orders shouted at some poor captive trapped at the bottom of a well. Bug isn't the most dynamic vocalist-- sounding not unlike Liars' Angus Andrew played at 16 rpm-- but for a band as harsh as this, he need not display a range of emotions so long as he convincingly conveys the right ones: grim and grimmer. And it's The Horror's dirgey digressions that actually best showcase his cold-blooded character, whether shaming a submissive subject into acting like a dog on ""Beg Like a Human"", or taking no small amount of glee in describing the agonizing process of dying by the noose on ""Hang Em' High"". In a world this bleak, the best you can hope for is a quick, easy death, and yet even then Pop. 1280 won't let you off that easy-- as Bug cautions us at the outset, ""Life after death is a painful life."" But he can rest assured that, with an album as unabashedly grim and unforgiving as The Horror, he needn't have to worry about being granted eternal salvation.","The N.Y. noise-punk quart's debut LP is an unabashedly grim collection, one that conjures the dystopian futurism of an early David Cronenberg film delivered with merciless brute force.

Clay Class,Prinzhorn Dance School,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33cb1335d7bf169a566/1:1/w_160/cc24fcd2.jpeg,2012-02-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16231-prinzhorn-dance-school/,DFA,"""I do not like change! I do not like change!"" When Tobin Prinz hollered those lines on Prinzhorn Dance School's 2007 self-titled debut, he was speaking in the crotchety voice of an uptight conservative caricature. But, judging by this five-years-in-the-waiting follow-up, the line serves as a handy bumper-sticker advertisement for his own band's cryogenically sealed post-punk aesthetic. If Gang of Four famously extracted the sex out of funk, then Prinzhorn Dance School suck the funk out of Gang of Four, retaining their violent guitar spasms, ominous bass throbs, derisive vocal interplay, and the claustrophobic, Entertainment!-style production, but breaking up the 4/4 fluidity into hiccupping, epileptic rhythms that, true to the PDS name, would seemingly require some educational instruction on how to dance to them. Where most bands reemerge from an extended absence exhibiting changed perspectives and freshly absorbed new influence, Prinzhorn Dance School remain defiantly un-evolved. No string sections, dubstep makeovers, or, hell, even a single cheery synthesizer line for these two; the challenge of telling the two albums apart could form the basis of a great dorm-room drinking game. But then, as that first record made clear, Prinzhorn Dance School's proudly spartan setup is simply a reflection of the harsh, unforgiving, hand-to-mouth nature of modern English life-- and it's not as if an interim economic collapse has made the situation any more promising. And so Clay Class presents familiarly despairing scenes of ""granite-gray"" skies and ""concrete hinterlands,"" while the band's instrumental economy extends to the songwriting, which can quantify the magnitude of the global recession in a single dispiriting couplet (""Got off the treadmill, treadmill/ Got in the breadline, breadline"") or disarmingly evocative image (""A tin of mixed fruit/ On special occasions""). As co-vocalists, Prinz and partner Suzi Horn rarely play off one another, or try to assert their individual identities; rather, their disparate voices-- a withering, monotone sing-speak for him, hyperactive yelps for her-- simply deliver the same dispiriting news with different degrees of anxiety. In the absence of any marked sonic or thematic progression, Clay Class at least captures the duo's growth as song arrangers, as they utilize their limited tools to greater dramatic effect. Where the songs on PDS' debut tended to stop once the duo ran out of things to say, Clay Class harnesses the band's repetitive bassline riffs and stuttering drum breaks to subtly ramp up the intensity (as on the extended shout-it-out chorus of ""Your Fire Has Gone Out!"") or uses them as foundations for melodic exploration: over the course of its five minutes, ""Turn Up the Lights"" magically changes its tenor from paranoid to optimistic without ever deviating from its core bassline or metronomic kick-drum beat. And with their usual matter-of-fact manifestos replaced by a more gentle harmony vocal, ""I Want You"" stands as Clay Class' greatest breakthrough, as the duo hew toward pop xx-ability by proffering a more personal, intimate narrative than their hardened worldview normally allows. Compared to the dramatic artistic strides that kindred spirits These New Puritans made on their sophomore release (2010's Hidden), Clay Class feels disappointingly stagnant. But it does offer encouraging signs that a blade of grass or two can sprout up from cracks in Prinzhorn Dance School's cold, concrete world.","Five years after Prinzhorn Dance School's self-titled debut, the UK post-punk duo of Tobin Prinz and partner Suzi Horn remain defiantly un-evolved.

Ester,Trailer Trash Tracys,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b348c0084474cd0c20d3/1:1/w_160/32173c41.jpeg,2012-02-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16239-trailer-trash-tracys-ester/,DominoDouble Six,"Almost three years ago a band called Trailer Trash Tracys surfaced on a No Pain In Pop compilation. Their song ""Strangling Good Guys"" stood out with its satisfyingly distorted drums and haze of lusty shoegaze pop. It was a cut that sounded fresh, powerful, and ended up feeling ahead of a curve that gave us the similarly fuzzy pop of the first Best Coast, Pearl Harbor, and Smith Westerns demos. A couple of singles and a long delay later, the band finally arrives at its debut record, Ester. While it's not a bad record, it ranks as a disappointment. The re-recorded version of ""Strangling Good Guys"" acts as a handy capsule to illustrate its problems: The blown-out drums of before are now neutered and low in the mix, and the toothy shattered-glass guitars are muzzled by newly flat production. It sounds like a song recorded by committee and subject to endless revisions, each new take diluting the original's potency. The delight of the demo version was that it felt like it existed on instinct and gut feeling, whereas this just sounds over-thought and dull. There's a minute of a great song in ""Dies in 55"", but that also falls apart beneath cluttered, confused elements. We're treated to awkward drum rolls, non sequitur bass drops, and a bassline that might well be offbeat, though in such a rhythmless environment it's difficult to tell.  There's nothing solid to glue these stuttering ideas together, and what started brightly quickly becomes a mess. Trailer Trash Tracys sound much better when they mine simple patterns. ""You Wish You Were Red"" is carried by a basic beat, nonchalant guitar, and a sparse bass pattern. The economy of ideas means that each good one has space to really work. The restraint lends the song an airy glow and also allows Susanne Aztoria's honeyed vocals to come to the fore. ""Candy Girl"" is another high point. The song first emerged a couple of years ago and, unlike ""Strangling Good Guys"", sounds as good as ever. The booming electronic drums and dirty, crackling guitar still carry a feeling of effortless cool as Aztoria's vocal swoops and dives. Her impressive knack for a tune is the band's big strength, and it's a shame that too often those melodies are squeezed or thrown off course by unnecessary parts. ""Engelhardt's Arizona"" is a perfect example of this. Aztoria's yearning vocal fizzes with intrigue, sounding a bit like Nina Persson of the Cardigans, but it's almost impossible to pick out any nuance beneath a maddening guitar part that feels like the product of somebody who just learned hammer-on techniques and wanted to show them off. That the 30-odd minutes of Ester took so long to finalize makes for a slightly baffling proposition, given that its two best moments sound so casually off-the-cuff and effortless.  At this point it's hard not to feel like the Trailer Trash Tracys who sounded pretty vital in 2009 have been left behind by a whole slew of bands that followed their starting gun and reached the finishing line quicker, and better.","After surfacing three years ago with a fresh, powerful sound, the London dream-pop quartet release their debut LP.

Blondes,Blondes,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33bc0084474cd0c20b9/1:1/w_160/4dd7c21d.jpeg,2012-02-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16230-blondes-blondes/,Rvng Intl.,"From music message boards to The Guardian, the term ""hipster house"" popped up late last year to describe a recent wave of dance music being made by ""rock"" or otherwise non-dance types. It encompasses acts like Miracles Club, Ital, and their 100% Silk labelmates, as well as like minds from the more established Italians Do It Better and DFA (Matmos member and Pitchfork contributor Drew Daniel rightly traces the approach's roots all the way back to Throbbing Gristle). The common thread is live electronic instrumentation and lo-fi recording as aesthetic choice (surely, these acts could just as easily afford to drop Ableton onto their laptops as buy rhythm boxes). The approach may recall house's 808 roots, but implicit in that troublesome ""hipster"" is the idea that these rock kids aren't taking dance music seriously or playing by its rules-- that they're treating it with the irony typically ascribed to the 2000s' favorite strawman. All of which makes Brooklyn duo Blondes both an archetypal hipster house act and a rewarding example of the tag's limitations. Archetypal because the duo of Zach Steinman and Sam Haar improvises on live instruments, records tracks in single takes rather than endlessly re-tooling them in software, and generally approaches making house tracks with an outsider's disregard for convention. The pair met while studying music and studio art at Oberlin College, which also birthed nü-disco producer Morgan Geist, amongst other acts, and they bring both learned musicianship and a collegiate friendliness toward jamming to bear on their self-titled full-length debut. Their songs begin with an idea or two-- a beat, an effect, a bassline, or synth phrase-- and gradually accrete more layers, steadily drifting toward a sustained climax before fading out piece by piece. It's the meandering feel of a jam locked into a linear structure: tracks that privilege house's hypnotic repetitions over its cathartic patterns of build-and-release. Blondes' formal transparency-- the way you can see each element as its being added-- makes it easy to imagine them playing these songs live, but they handily avoid the lo-fi ""live PA"" quality that makes some of their putative peers less than suitable for club sound systems and dance floors. Blondes collects three previously released 12""'s and a pair of new songs, each arranged as oppositional A- and B-sides: ""Lover""/""Hater"", ""Business""/""Pleasure"", ""Water""/""Wine"", and ""Gold""/""Amber"". These flipsides aren't exactly dub versions of their related tracks, but they are frequently more subdued reflections-- the bright synth arpeggios and displaced voices on the A-sides submerged into deep house bass thump or ambient atmospherics on their reverse. A second disc of remixes generally pulls the tracks even further towards their polar extremes, with typically mixed results. Optimo's JD Twitch ratchets up the tribal thump of ""Lover"", while Dungeon Acid remake it as a sweat-dripping subterranean epic at 11 minutes. Andy Stott's ""Pleasure"" becomes a muffled deep house throb, while Teengirl Fantasy's remix of ""Wine"" ups the lush synth pads and adds some piano tinkling, and Bicep's remix of ""Water"" adds a pneumatic jacking beat and echoing diva vocals. Laurel Halo and Rene Hell respectively make ""Gold"" and ""Amber"" into gaseous ambient and an elegiac organ variation. At worst, the remixes are fine but superfluous for all but the specialty DJ or completist; the highlights above make at turns interesting, useful, and simply pleasurable revisions. Early reviews situated Blondes as better headphone listening than dance-floor filler, and while their releases prior to these 12""'s were more downtempo, this also points to the fact that their songs are simply well produced, as pleasurable on a pure sonic level as they are practical. Despite retaining a relaxed, lightly psychedelic feel, Blondes' songs are properly functionalist grooves. They may lack the rise-and-fall amplitude of traditional house, but on what everyone from Philip Sherburne to the Moritz Von Oswald Trio have recognized as electronic music's ""horizontal"" axis, they succeed admirably. Only one h-word needed.","The Brooklyn outsider house duo's debut LP collects three previously released 12""'s, a pair of new songs, and a second disc of remixes by Andy Stott, Teengirl Fantasy, and Laurel Halo, among others.

Instrumental University,AraabMuzik,by: Carrie Battan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34fb1335d7bf169a58e/1:1/w_160/5f961030.jpeg,2012-02-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/,Duke,"In the time since AraabMuzik linked up with Dipset and pegged himself to their reemergence with the door-smashing ""Salute"" beat, he's become a web-2.0 model of the hip-hop producer as brand, mapping his aesthetic vision onto an array of contexts. The surface-beautiful Electronic Dream, for example, introduced him to a wider audience in part because it veered from the tougher-sounding beats Araab makes for rappers. But it still made sense next to what came before, offering up an entrancing, self-contained sound that grabbed at dance club roots but darkened and abstracted its samples to suggest something private and intimate. And he has a serious live reputation, with a unique approach to performance. AraabMuzik is a virtuoso percussionist whose instrument just happens to be an MPC pad, and longtime Dipset fans and fashionable interlopers alike elbow one another for space around his table, collectively freaking out over the physical spectacle. He's also booked for a Coachella slot this year, and says he's planning to release a collaborative project with equally doted-upon Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky. You'd be hard-pressed to find a producer with as much reach as a solo commodity as Araab right now. He's having a moment. Given all of that, the timing of Instrumental University feels off. It's a serviceable sampler of harder-knocking beats cleaved off largely unmemorable recent releases from some of his most trusted collaborators-- Lloyd Banks, Fabolous, Jim Jones and, of course, Dipset pals Cam'ron and Vado, among others. And while it's perfectly natural for a producer in AraabMuzik's position to make a beat tape-- it's a time-honored rap tradition, after all, and he's indulged before-- it's not something that fits the arc of his current upswing. As the cover implies, this is a release presumably aimed at beat nerds and aspiring rappers looking for tracks. That's disappointing if you're still high on Clams Casino's re-imagining of what this sort of thing can be-- his thick and stoned Instrumental Mixtape from last spring reinvigorated the idea of the producer as auteur instead of background figure. But Instrumental University sticks to a more traditional script. Given the fact that he's charging money for these tracks (many of which first appeared on free mixtapes), and peppering them with his increasingly annoying drop, ""You are now listening to AraabMuzik,"" Instrumental University might seem like a self-congratulatory stopgap if the beats weren't so consistently expert and sleek. He moves from the horror-film piano chords and signature echoey screams of ""1, 2, 3 Grind"" to the soul-sampling, nearly Dipset-classic vibe of ""Ain't Mad Acha"". The same sensibility is obviously behind it, but these tracks are built from a very different foundation than those found on billowy Electronic Dream. And because there are no beats taken from real hit-hits here (the instrumental from ""Salute"" and the unrelenting chipmunky smack of ""Rubberband Stacks"" are the closest we get), Araab avoids that unsatisfied lurch of anticipation for a familiar verse that never drops. In fact, there's a strong inverse relationship between the listenability of the instrumentals and the strength of the tracks with verses. So this is background music, sure, a workmanlike collection of beats that oscillates within a narrow but extremely proficient range of sound. Still, even for its failings as a proper album, Instrumental University is still quintessential Araab, constantly walking the razor-sharp line between glimmery and ominous. At this point, he's still known first and foremost as someone who can pound the living daylight out of a set of MPC pads. But we're again reminded that his identity also rests in his distinctive ear for uneasy mood, a quality subtle and delicate and not tied to any one technique.","Following on last year's hypnotic Electronic Dream, this set collects beats made for rappers including Lloyd Banks, Fabolous, Jim Jones, Cam'ron, Vado, and others.

They!Live,Benjamin Damage & Doc Daneeka,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34bea9e61561daa6a82/1:1/w_160/ac394cf6.jpeg,2012-02-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16241-theylive/,50 Weapons,"On paper, Doc Daneeka and Benjamin Damage seem like such a perfect match that you'd expect any musical collaboration to mirror their work apart: Damage, with or without erstwhile partner Venom, has specialized in bouncy bass-driven house heavy on UK funky snares, while Doc Daneeka has peddled a slightly more rigorous but no less athletic take on precisely the same sound (check 2010's furrow-browed but undeniably huge remix of Breach's ""Fatherless""). So it's surprising how subtle, sedate, and frankly unlike their former selves They!Live turns out to be; the transformation reminds me of raver friends who hooked up on a drug binge and then promptly moved out to the suburbs to grow vegetables together. There was a honeymoon moment where the partying trajectory carried through the first flush of romance: On their first single together, last year's aptly named ""Creeper"", Daneeka and Damage hit upon the best of all possible worlds, offering a throbbing bad dream of strobing, bleepy synth organ riffs over remorseless 4x4 kick drums, if not ""Show Me Love"" then maybe ""Show Me Anxiety"". In the tune's second half, after a build up that becomes more deliciously interminable with each replay, they unleash a thunderous rave breakbeat rhythm over a woman's outraged declaration, ""you're nasty!""-- the massiveness of the revelation made possible only by the drawn-out nature of the slow-reveal. In its simplicity and patience, ""Creeper"" seemed at odds with both the rave revivalism it superficially referenced (in truth the result was closer to early Underworld) and the typically cluttered post-everything maximalism of current UK dance music (not to mention Damage and Daneeka's own pasts). They!Live stretches the already strained relationship further, offering nine voluptuously melancholy tech-house slowburners, each trying to outdo the other for how tightly wound it can hold itself, how reluctantly it can give up its secrets. In many ways this is a fine thing, not least because even as they embrace grayscale, pseudo-minimal tech-house with gusto, the duo cannot help but infuse the arrangements with its trademark rhythmic restlessness, evidenced less by a riot of percussion than by its careful, strategic deployment within slippery, snaking grooves, like the papery, syncopated snares weaving in and out of the distracted, sleepy female vocals of ""Battleships"", or the stop-start tango struggling to emerge out of the bleak techno pound of ""Ellipsis Torment"", or the tiny, irresistible drum rolls that seem so out-of-place and yet so welcome on the otherwise severe, glacial closer ""Bleach & Penicillin"". But it's a problem for They!Live that a foreshortened, less charming ""Creeper"", if not the album's loudest moment, remains by some distance its most memorable and gregarious, with only the melancholy stutters of ""Charlottenburg"" and the clipped, synth-driven house of ""Juggernaut"" coming remotely close. Part of the problem, though only part, is that the duo have swapped a Spartan (albeit decreasingly so) musical landscape for a densely populated one, and then set out about erasing any tell-tale signs that they haven't been living in the neighborhood forever. Maybe they need to hang out with the locals more: Like many UK producers who have travelled to Berlin and become entranced by its techno culture, Damage and Daneeka have absorbed much of the city's musical seriousness and subtlety, and some of its emotional sweep, but too little of its frenzy or perverse sense of humor. It'd be much easier to love, as opposed to merely like, They!Live's glistening, long-form tech-house soundscapes if there were more bombs and curveballs hidden amongst its lovingly pruned forest glades.","On paper, these bass-driven house producers seem like such a perfect match you'd expect any musical collaboration to mirror their work apart.

Tally Ho! Flying Nun's Greatest Bits,Various Artists,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34913d197565213a8fc/1:1/w_160/583ac26a.jpeg,2012-02-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16240-va-tally-ho-flying-nuns-greatest-bits/,Flying Nun,"Even among the topmost tier of hallowed indie rock labels, it's tough finding an imprint that's permeated underground music's subconscious as profoundly as Flying Nun. Founded in 1981, when punk's initial explosion was still ricocheting around globe, the Christchurch, New Zealand-based label put its faith in scrappy, locally grown pop-- music that was heavy on the jangly guitars, but generally low on polish, bands like the Clean, the Bats, the Chills, and the Tall Dwarfs. Virtually every decent guitar record pressed in the three decades since has owed some sort of debt to the Kiwi jangle pop-- see Galaxie 500's On Fire, Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted, or Yo La Tengo's Painful. I'm convinced that ""Pink Frosty"", from Fugazi's End Hits is a nod to the Chills' spooky post-punk classic, ""Pink Frost"", though I've never taken the initiative to verify it. (But, come on; listen to them back to back and tell me that they aren't similar.) More recently, bands such as Real Estate, Woods, Vivian Girls, and Crystal Stilts (basically, anything on Brooklyn-born record label Woodsist) have picked up the torch for the jangle-pop side of imprint's oeuvre. It would wrong to label it a revival, though. In 30 years, the Flying Nun sound has never slipped too far from the conversation. Tally Ho is Flying Nun's greatest-hits record, released partly to honor the label's 30th birthday. A 2xCD set, the compilation bundles together tunes from across the label's catalog, from late-1980s classics to material gleaned from more recent signings. Flying Nun is no stranger to comp records. The label has already gathered together its out-of-print singles (Where in the World is Wendy Broccoli?), lauded its contributions to the indie-pop landscape (Speed of Sound), celebrated at least three birthdays with label-history-spanning mix CDs (10th, 21st years) and, for the 25th anniversary, an exhaustive 4xCD box set. This time around, they go for the middle ground. The late-1980s groups that established the label's legend are all accounted for and frequently represented by their most recognizable songs, such as the Chills' shimmering ""Heavenly Pop Hit"" and the Clean's three-chord classic, ""Tally Ho!"" from which the collection takes its name. But Tally Ho also weaves in some of the roster's lesser known acts-- bands like Look Blue Go Purple, Sneaky Feelings, and the Headless Chickens, that, until now, only your Audio Galaxy-mining college roommate ever had the wherewithal to dig up. The comp makes a concerted effort to avoid short changing Flying Nun's newer additions, but most seem skippable when slotted alongside groups from the label's late-80s to mid-90s golden era. Hearing 30 years of Flying Nun records stacked up alongside one another speaks well to the breadth of the label's taste. While the Dunedin Sound-- the jangle pop tones favored by the Chills, the Bats, and the Clean-- tends to steal the spotlight, Flying Nun's aesthetic is not easily pigeonholed. The label also ponied up the cash to release aggressive and noisy music, such as the Gordons, New Zealand's answer to Flipper (who later morphed into the more overtly psychedelic Bailter Space), and scrape and drone pioneers the Dead C. Loud, brutal, druggy music that couldn't possibly score a radio hit, even at the bottom of the world.","The influential New Zealand label put together a 2xCD with songs from across its varied catalog to honor its 30th birthday.

No One Can Ever Know,The Twilight Sad,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30713d197565213a891/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-02-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16189-no-one-can-ever-know/,Fat Cat,"Here's an incomplete recap of the Twilight Sad's self-reported listening syllabus leading up to their third album, No One Can Ever Know: Cabaret Voltaire, Magazine, Autechre, Public Image Ltd., Nine Inch Nails. In other words, a group that has to this point been either compared to shoegazers or other Scottish acts (Aereogramme, Mogwai) was looking to completely overhaul its sound. That's a good thing-- while their debut Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters was the work of a powerful and fully realized band, its follow-up Forget the Night Ahead suggested it wasn't a particularly versatile one. Whether it was a result of familiarity or just its suffocated production, the torrential downpour of Andy MacFarlane's guitars and James Graham's heavily accented howl didn't have the same impact. Now here's a nearly complete list of who No One Can Ever Know actually sounds like: The Twilight Sad. That's also a good thing. No One Can Ever Know is kind of a failure as a total sonic rebranding, but it's a strong transition for the band into something a little more form-fitting while carrying over their commitment to morose atmosphere and Graham's handsome vocals, deeply entrenched characteristics that just so happen to be their strengths. Still, that they brought in Andrew Weatherall to produce is proof enough that they meant business. The mention of Weatherall's name most instantly brings to mind his work on Primal Scream's Screamadelica and Fuck Buttons' Tarot Sport, two records whose wildly bright timbres and celebratory attitudes exist somewhere way the fuck on the other side of the world from where the Twilight Sad set up shop. That's still the case if song titles like ""Kill It in the Morning"" and ""Dead City"" are any indication of what's to come, and they sure are. It's tough to pinpoint the exact contributions, but whether Weatherall was meant as a spiritual adviser or a contributor is a moot point-- the Twilight Sad intended for this to be a frigid, militant, and rhythmic record, and they got it. The main difference is the shape these songs allow themselves to take: ""Cold Days From the Birdhouse"" and ""I Became a Prostitute"" achieved weapons-grade catharsis by cresting and crashing unexpectedly, visually represented by right-angle dynamics. No longer able to fall back on volcanic distortion to bring the big moments, the Twilight Sad have more curvature and forward motion, something closer to the color-drained gothic clangor of *Pornography-*era Cure (""Don't Look at Me"") or ""Street Spirit""/""Knives Out"" Radiohead (particularly ""Sick"") than any of the post-punk firebrands they namechecked. Accordions (or approximations thereof) wheeze, artificial strings moan, and guitars are thick with distortion, yet everything feels of a single piece, and at first it makes No One feel a bit limited dynamically compared to its predecessors. But it's a record more about obsession than release, and the mesmerizing, cyclical guitar figures of ""Sick"" and the throttle-down locomotion of ""Don't Move"" make the best use of repetition as a conveyance of passion. Easy as it is to dwell on the instrumental changes, No One focuses on what might not be Graham's rangiest performance, but certainly his most absorbing. His vocals have always been too prominent to make the shoegaze comparisons stick, and he's just less of a competitor for sonic space this time around, which is key to understanding No One's appeal. Though an undoubtedly emotive singer, Graham isn't much of a details guy-- there was something post-traumatic about Fourteen and Forget, the sudden rupturing of the music acting as a counterbalance to Graham's lyrics, which were evocative in a general sense and every bit as repressed in a literal one. The emotions were identifiable, the events not so much. There was no real way to determine what they were ""about"" specifically, which is true of No One Can Ever Know as well, but there's a crucial role reversal for both Graham and the listener, in that the former is an aggressor rather than a victim and the latter is assumed to actually be in on the conversation rather than being a therapeutic sounding board. Or maybe we're in on a confession-- Graham's words are carefully chosen and ominous, something like an urgent call on a tapped phone. Something has clearly gone wrong, possibly a murder but definitely a love crime. Throughout, Graham does little to distinguish between the two, he and an unnamed other ""paired off in the violence."" The chorus of subtly dramatic opener ""Alphabet"" contains the Twilight Sad's most surefooted melody and Graham's most legible declaration: ""So sick to death of the sight of you now/ Safe to say I've never wanted you more."" Likewise, on ""Don't Move"", Graham's brogue smears the album's two parallel, primal instincts (""I want you more than you will ever know"" and ""I'll hurt you more than you will ever know""), his dead-eyed recitation of those words betraying that he's hanging on for dear life to any kind of sanity. It's not really accurate to call ""Kill It in the Morning"" delayed gratification-- not when No One is actually the most sedate and evil Twilight Sad album-- but after five minutes of spiky industrial grind, the music drops out for an exasperated Graham to yell, ""What more do you need to know?/ It's staying here well down below."" It gives the feeling of a story completed, and while the wholeness of No One is absorbing to those in tune with the Twilight Sad's relentlessly downbeat demeanor, it's easy to see it as forbidding or impenetrable. Multiple listens reveal layers instead of peaks, and that's to be expected from a band for whom volume and texture meant more than melody: While the greyscale atmopsherics of ""Nil"" and ""Not Sleeping"" contribute to No One's sonic consistency, if you don't immediately take a shine to Graham's mantric vocals, there aren't a lot of thrills to find in the cushy synth pads behind him. But even if No One Can Ever Know is more of a way to please those already down for the cause than a means of bringing new listeners into the fold, the attempts to push the boundaries of sound and setting result in the least-insular Twilight Sad album to date-- the kids are still on fire, they've just left the bedroom.","The Scottish trio's frigid, militant, rhythmic Andrew Weatherall-produced third LP is more about obsession than release.

We Will Always Be,Windy & Carl,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3335e6ef95969322404/1:1/w_160/5f6b6678.jpeg,2012-02-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16222-we-will-always-be/,Kranky,"There's a disarming honesty to the way Michigan-based husband and wife duo Windy & Carl communicate with one another. A blog post from Windy, published in late 2011, describes the making of We Will Always Be, framing it in the context of their relationship. ""Yeah, we have had bumps in the road, and on occasion it seems as if we may never recover from these bumps, but we do,"" she wrote. That type of candor doesn't stop at the written word; it also bleeds through into the duo's music. Often their work is collaborative, at other times there are vast expanses of sound featuring Carl playing alone. Either way, this album, their first since Songs for the Broken Hearted in 2008, is executed with openness and sincerity, making it feel as if the usual barriers between audience and performer simply aren't there. When Windy & Carl lock together, it's like being privy to a great secret, imparted in a moment of intensely personal creativity. This record shifts through three distinct phases, with a definitive beginning, middle, and end. It travels from temperate ripples at the start through craggy rock faces in the center. The close is like an impossibly smooth glide across freshly laid snow. As with most of Windy & Carl's music, the lyrics are frequently indecipherable. The emotional impact is torn from the overall feel, which shifts from rueful acoustic work (""For Rosa"") to forceful, repetitive drone rock (""Fainting in the Presence of the Lord""). The spaces in-between those extremes are smudged with color, sometimes bearing the kind of drifty essence My Bloody Valentine mustered up on ""To Here Knows When"". Like Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher, Windy & Carl's work often resembles the sound of a couple retreating from the world in order to understand their place within it. The way We Will Always Be is put together only adds to that feeling. It resembles an orderly dissection of the relationship cycle, where unruffled, carefree beginnings melt into discord and conflict, ultimately settling into the strange kind of parity that outsiders to any long-term relationship find hard to fathom. Their musical assimilation of that rocky mid-section, where the delicate framework of understanding built up around a couple feels as if it could crash and fall at any minute, is the most spectacular. It begins in the climb out of ""Remember"" and into ""Fainting in the Presence of the Lord"". The latter, almost 19 minutes long, is full of cadaverous twirls of processed noise, which get sucked into an atom-smashing guitar loop that trudges into the middle of the song, heaving it to a lumbering close. Whatever Windy & Carl are working out here, which even Windy's candid blog posts don't reveal, it's clearly taken them to some dark places. Despite feeling like the work of a couple laying themselves bare, it's also music to get lost in, to block out the real world. You could stretch out for days in the quiet whirr of Carl's ring-shaped instrumental passages. That duality of purpose is one of the greatest strengths Windy & Carl possess-- the ability to conjure up contrasting feelings through their work. It's what makes an album like We Will Always Be worth returning to often, with different aspects of it coming to light depending on mood, setting, and personal circumstance. In a heartbeat it can flick from the sinister whispered vocals of ""Nature of Memory"" to the serene ice-drones of ""Looking Glass"". But it never feels like forced change. There's always a natural bridge taking you from one world to the next, like a guide taking you through Windy & Carl's singular ways, providing this album with the conceptual heft it feeds on to flourish.","The Michigan-based husband and wife dream-pop duo's newest resembles an orderly dissection of the relationship cycle, making it feel as if the usual barriers between audience and performer simply aren't there.

iTunes Session,Wilco,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33e5e6ef9596932241a/1:1/w_160/a318c23b.jpeg,2012-02-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16227-itunes-sessions/,Anti-dBpm,"An eight-song iTunes Session EP hardly seems conducive to taking in the full scope of a band's career, especially when the tracklist primarily comprises songs from the most recent album. But we've got a few months' perspective on The Whole Love now*,* and this new release unearths a track from Wilco's 1995 debut, A.M., which suggests they're getting back to the business of being a pop band. They aren't curtailing their experimental urges so much as they're putting more emphasis on tight songs they'd want to play and you'd want to hear in a semi-live setting. There is, in other words, a retrospective undercurrent to iTunes Session, which, instead of including the 10-minute krautrock jams and noise-rock punctuations of their early-2000s heyday, looks to the song-oriented period just before and just after. Rethinking what it means to be Wilco has always been a big part of being Wilco, so the inclusion of the 17-year-old ""Passenger Side"" suggests a band seriously reassessing its past and drawing strong connections between the Wilco of 1995, the Wilco of 2002, and the Wilco of 2012. The band has exhibited an enduring propensity for noisy undercurrents, concise vocal hooks, and unexpected nods to pop history, all of which are animated by Tweedy's lyrics, which range from invigorated nonsense (""I Might"") to semi-tragic lucidity (""Passenger Side""). Toward that end, iTunes Session emphasizes the immediate over the arty, omitting the rambling Whole Love opener ""Art of Almost"" in favor of that album's catchiest tracks and choosing the direly hooky ""War on War"" instead of some of the strident tracks from their catalog. For those of us who prefer Wilco's pop songs over their avant-garde numbers, this is a strong, short set, emphasizing buoyant momentum over digressive din. The tracks don't sound quite as full in this setting as they did on The Whole Love, but there's still a lot of charm and dynamism in the way the bass and keyboards trade off the ascending/ descending riff on ""I Might"", like kids taking turns on the playground slide. If this version surpasses the studio take, it's largely due to Tweedy's exaggerated sighs. Only ""Black Moon"" suffers in this setting, becoming so lax that it threatens to dissipate altogether. It's clear the band is less interested in that sort of high-concept noodling than they are in simply jamming. In that regard, Wilco have hijacked the iTunes Session and turned it into a document of the Whole Love tour. These are, ostensibly, crowd favorites, tightened and refined in front of big crowds. They even bring out avuncular opening act Nick Lowe for a workmanlike rendering of his 1979 hit ""Cruel to Be Kind"", a regular encore over the last few months. It's a fine song, a bit redundant and not quite as relevant to the band as their B-side cover of Lowe's ""I Love My Label"", but you can hear how much fun Wilco (or ""Wilc-Lowe,"" as Tweedy introduced the band at a recent show in Chicago) are having just singing those doo-doo-doo's. Lowe is, in fact, an intriguing forebear for Wilco, a man who transformed himself seemingly effortlessly from a post-punk smartass into a genial country crooner. More recently, he's settled into a gentle nostalgia that lends his recent albums-- specifically At My Age and That Old Magic-- a wistful gravity that pushes against any notion of granddad rock. Similarly, Tweedy seems intent on forging a lengthy career with just as many twists and turns, dark corners, and bright avenues. Which is where this new version of ""Passenger Side"" comes in: Just as Lowe's country material has proven every bit as sturdy as his Stiff Records output, Wilco are pointing to some hidden gems in their own catalog, rehabbing forgotten tunes to prove that the band hasn't gotten better or worse, just different. That old song, so straightforward and unassuming, settles in remarkably well among their more recent, more celebrated material, so how long till dBpm releases a deluxe reissue of A.M.?","This eight-song EP, comprised primarily of tracks from Wilco's most recent album The Whole Love, also finds them unearthing older song-oriented material that suggests they're getting back to the business of being a pop band.

Probably Love,o F F Love,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33dc0084474cd0c20bf/1:1/w_160/c35c0435.jpeg,2012-02-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16232-probably-love/,M=Maximal,"A cinephile friend recently described a gross tactical error made by Oscar-fave The Artist: It approached silent films as a genre rather than a method for making them. Musicians make this mistake too. Consider vocal processing. The amount of time spent warping, burying, and looping the human voice has increased exponentially as artists have found it an effective tool for bridging the gaps between man and machine (James Blake), ecstasy and violence (the Weeknd), past and present (Ariel Pink). R&B's delirious emotional states have proven particularly fertile ground for artists like Jacques Greene, How to Dress Well, and Autre Ne Veut. Successful applications, all, and while actual output varies, these artists have enough in common that foggy vocals have become a zeitgeist of modern underground music. Enter o F F Love, a French transplant living in Berlin, who-- you guessed it-- has mistaken this choral thicket for an end-game. With its sounds of pop and R&B stylized to abstraction, it is impossible to imagine Probably Love, o F F Love's debut LP, dropping any time but the present. One year ago it would've seemed obscure; one year from now, it will sound archaic. o F F Love exists as a prism that refracts the most facile aspects of chillwave, witch-house, and PBR&B to deleterious effect and, in doing so, provides a glimpse of how damaging indie rock's obsession with memory and obfuscation can be. o F F Love's penchant for obscurity is not just musical. Little is known about the producer, who hides his face behind a scarf and ballcap. Mangled phonetics (e.g. ""Makeupworz"", ""Missthemway (Again)"") aid in building the mystery, I suppose. What little o F F Love media exists-- a spare website, a YouTube channel, a SoundCloud-- indicate an interest in teen-pop fanaticism, potentially fecund territory for a deconstructionist. This fascination proves to be entirely visual, however, as Probably Love establishes a template of queasy vocal refrains, dull kick drums, and aerosol-laced synths. The vocals are provided by o F F Love himself. Or they're sampled. Either way, human voices are slathered in Auto-Tune, reducing the opportunity for a big reveal or the establishment of a discernible vocal presence. I suspect Probably Love was recorded entirely using software, but ultimately that doesn't matter: What matters is that this album sounds like it's been filtered through an overheated laptop's cooling fan, so shrill is its palate. Probably Love smolders in this dissonant, digital pit, its every minor chord, snare hit, and intonation laid to waste by hot, harsh circuits. The tempos do not help. Probably Love sputters, distended phrasing and echoing snares left to linger: The shrieking, nauseous interjections of ""Be Around U"" and rudderless vowels of ""Everyday, My Holy Day"" are egregious offenders. The cumulative effect is advanced narcolepsy, someone blowing spit bubbles with soft synths and drum machines. When o F F Love does allow a quicker tempo to invade-- such as on the almost pretty masturbation fantasy ""Beating for You""-- it predictably drags his vocals out of the muck as well. Perhaps you think I'm missing the point, that o F F Love's blur&B contains some hard-won beauty or relevant commentary. But Probably Love isn't beautiful; its ugliness and pessimism exhaust me. And what greater point could he be making? Probably Love is the frightful dead-end of so many recent trends, the point at which we lose sight of what question is being answered, what volley is being returned.","Stylized to abstraction, it is impossible to imagine Probably Love, o F F Love's debut LP, dropping any time but the present.

Lock Out,Waka Flocka FlameFrench Montana,by: David Turner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3465e6ef95969322427/1:1/w_160/b3d08fb7.jpeg,2012-02-01 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16237-lock-out/,self-released,"Last year was a weird one for albums by rap duos. We had Jay-Z and Kanye, Eminem and Royce Da 5'9"", and of course Gucci Mane, who released two major label duo albums-- the disappointing Ferrari Boyz with Waka Flocka Flame and the bizarre BAYTL with Kreayshawn associate V-Nasty. This time out, Waka pairs with French Montana, who has worked extensively with the currently imprisoned Max B, formally of the Harlem based Byrdgang. Coming from Atlanta by way of New York City, Waka's energetic and aggressive style has endured longer than most probably would have suspected. When he released his first single, ""O Let's Do It"", he was mostly known as the guy standing in the shadows of old Gucci Mane and OJ Da Juiceman videos. French Montana has been around for a few more years than Waka in the New York mixtape circuit, but last year's ""Choppa Choppa Down"" and his most recent single, ""Shot Caller"", got him signed to Bad Boy Records and got his name out there nationwide. Given the players, you might expect Lock Out to be an East Coast rap affair, but with a couple of exceptions (the bouncy seriousness of ""Dat All"" and the triumphant finale of ""Promise""), the tape sounds well-grounded in the streets of Atlanta. The production on Lock Out is handled mostly by two producers with whom Waka has worked extensively (Southside and Lex Luger), alongside other lesser-knowns who share an appreciation for dark, brooding beats that are, ultimately, pretty hard to distinguish from one another. The first half of the tape finds French Montana struggling to find his footing as his flow reduces songs to a slow creak, while Waka affirms his ability to rip any rap instrumental he comes across. ""1230"" has a great opening verse by Waka, and he delivers one of the strongest hooks on the mixtape, but the momentum that track builds is lost as soon as French appears, as he just cannot keep up with Waka's pace. French Montana does have a few moments like ""Call It Dat"", a rare track where they display an equal amount of intensity. The same goes for ""We Mobb"" featuring Prodigy, where French sounds right at home and Waka shows going back to his New York roots can work, as they rap over the beat from Mobb Deep's vintage ""Hell on Earth"". But the more you hear the mixtape, the more you wish they'd found a better middle ground. The first single from Waka's upcoming album, ""Round of Applause"", produced by Lex Luger, is a great slice of Atlanta strip club music in the vein of Travis Porter, and it's a good match for French's style, since it would allow him to relax his flow a bit. French's recent hit single ""Shot Caller"" is a jazzy New York cut that could use a regional expanding verse energy ball verse from Waka to give it more radio and club appeal. On these songs, you get a better sense of why they'd want to work together, but Lock Out never comes close to that promise.","Produced mostly by Southside and Lex Luger, the collaboration between Waka Flocka Flame and French Montana sounds more well-grounded in the streets of Atlanta than the East Coast rap scene.

I Love You,Jason Urick,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3445e6ef95969322425/1:1/w_160/05cae3ff.jpeg,2012-02-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16236-i-love-you/,Thrill Jockey,"The changes in a single Jason Urick track are gradual and sometimes imperceptible. But his musical development across records he's made for Thrill Jockey since his band Wzt Hearts broke up is clear. Husbands, from 2009, offered mostly thick drones, suggesting a digital take on Spacemen 3's further-out meditations. Dub-inflected loops lurked beneath the drones on 2010's Fussing & Fighting 12"". Now, on his best effort yet, I Love You, Urick's dub obsessions have moved to the front of the room. Urick hasn't abandoned drone-- layers of noise and columns of sound remain primary colors in his palette. But what sticks strongest in memory after I Love You flows through your ears are the hypnotic cycles of bass, beat, and melody. Think of drone as the light Urick shines on his loops, or the water he sprays on them: The sheen makes them glisten and thicken as they slowly gain texture, but they hold up through the noise, rarely burning out or washing away under the busy sonics. The clearest and perhaps catchiest example is I Love You's middle track, ""Ageless Isms"". It opens with a reggae hook, which Urick douses in brittle screech, warps with wavy noise, and stretches with phases that seem to stop time. All of these moves make the song radiate, even as the original hook gets cut until it bleeds. By the end, that hook is no longer prominent, but its ghost persists like a shadow stretching past the horizon. Such morphing is perhaps what Urick means when he explains how the album title (taken from a film about a man obsessed with a talking keychain that says ""I love you"" incessantly) became a personal mantra. ""[I kept] running the phrase over and over in my head,"" he says in press materials, ""until the words started to break down and render the phrase foreign again."" Oddly, the album's most interesting piece, ""Don't Digital"", is its least repetitive. But the way Urick melts all his sounds together, and the hue of Eastern ritual they exude, gives the track a devout feel. It's cyclical in a way that suggests something primal, like the movement of tides or the rotation of the earth. Which makes the cover image of I Love You-- the crystal-clear ""Blue Marble"" shot of the earth from space-- a bit obvious. But Urick seems uninterested in hiding ideas under ironic distance or opaque sonics. As complex and dense as these five songs can be, you can always hear everything going on. So even when he closes the record with his thickest cut, ""Syndromes"", there's a clear vision that's apparent long before his drones shrink down to a lone rhythm. Maybe that's what Urick means by I Love You-- he's too enamored of the sounds he gathers to lock them up in noise.","Since the dissolution of his band Wzt Hearts, Jason Urick has made a series of records for Thrill Jockey that have moved through drone and dub-inflected atmosphere. This could be his best solo LP yet.

Rad Times Xpress IV,Black Bananas,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31fea9e61561daa6a36/1:1/w_160/092ad4f4.jpeg,2012-02-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16209-black-bananas/,Drag City,"The institution of classic rock-- and all the FM-radio stations, VH1 specials, and ""Disco Sucks"" rallies it has propagated-- is built upon a certain they-don't-make-'em-like-they-used-to purism. But the genre's most esteemed icons have ultimately survived because they've occasionally been willing to break down rock's rigidity to absorb decidedly non-rock influences, be it the Stones flirting with reggae and disco on Black and Blue, Paul McCartney trying his hand at new wave on McCartney II, or Neil Young's infamous synth-pop odyssey Trans. None of these may count as those artists' definitive works but, given that rock'n'roll itself began as an unholy union of blues, jazz, folk, and country, these sorts of sacreligious stylistic detours and genre experiments were arguably truer to the music's original spirit than anything that tried to milk fresh inspiration from the I, IV, and V chords. Jennifer Herrema's first band, Royal Trux, understood this all too well, as she and partner Neil Hagerty broke down and reassembled their 1970s blues-rock foundation into all sorts of distorted shapes over the course of a tangled, tangential 10-album discography. But since that band dissolved in 2001, Herrema has been following a more linear path with her post-Trux outfit RTX, who, with each successive record, have been gradually refining and polishing themselves into the last hair-metal band standing-- a stance so antithetical to prevailing indie-rock mores, it's practically avant garde. If Royal Trux were about deconstructing rock mythology, RTX aggressively reasserted it, from the cover-art drawings of Herrema that look like they were cribbed from some daydreaming high-school student's notepad, to giving their studio albums titles such as JJ Got Live RaTX that suggest they're some long-lost concert bootleg, to the intra-band references (RTX being an acronym that first appeared in the 1990 Royal Trux track ""RTX-USA"") that casts Herrema's entire oeuvre as some sort of secret-society code waiting to be deciphered. The narrative gets even more convoluted with the arrival of Black Bananas, which boasts the same personnel as RTX; copped its name from an RTX song lyric; and whose debut album title, Rad Times Xpress IV, makes a smidgen of sense only if seen as the fourth RTX effort. (It also includes a song titled, confusingly enough, ""RTX Go-Go"".) And RTX's penchant for straight-up sleazy rock'n'roll carried through to the new band's first public offering last fall, a faithful cover of the Stones' ""Before They Make Me Run"", complete with an uncannily Neil Hagerty-like guest vocal from Kurt Vile that actually makes the song sound more like Royal Trux than anything RTX ever attempted. But that cover selection proves prophetic not for its form but for its source: 1978's Some Girls, arguably the Stones' most stylistically varied album, what with Mick Jagger channelling his New York-nightlife escapades into the Studio 54 strut of ""Miss You"" and the CBGB snarl of ""Shattered"". Following the same logic, Herrema fashions Black Bananas as an alternate-universe RTX who aren't afraid to absorb more modern influences like synth-pop, hip-hop, French-touch house, and (for 10 seconds of ""RTX Go-Go"" at least) dancehall, while guitarist Brian McKinley lays off the usual Eddie Van Halen histrionics in favor of lysergic Eddie Hazel funk. The album doesn't so much begin as burst its dam, with opener ""It's Cool"" arriving in such a thick surge of wah-wahed guitars and phased-out synths, it takes you a minute to realize the song actually adheres to standard blues structure. In accommodating all of these disparate sound sources in a limited-range but densely textured mix, Rad Times Xpress IV finds a direct antecedent in Royal Trux's 1998 classic Accelerator (which essentially sounded like an arena-rock band playing inside of a vacuum cleaner) while feeling remarkably of a piece with contemporary strains of chillwave and electro-rock. (To wit, Black Bananas' first North American tour sees them opening for Sleigh Bells.) Where past RTX albums faithfully approximated the flash and thrash of 1980s metal with all the diligence of a Civil War reenactment, Rad Times Xpress IV illuminates how well that music lends itself to more experimental renderings (the tape-decayed boogie of ""TV Trouble"" and ""Hot Stupid"" sound like Aerosmith as produced by Ariel Pink; ""Rad Times"" crosswires Kraftwerkian funk and KISS crunch) while the songs seemingly engineered to hold onto RTX's denim'n'leather constituency yield surprises: ""Acid Song"" is actually a sultry slow jam, and ""Killer Weed"" rides its Ted Nugent riffs into a dubby denouement. However, even as its title track excitedly welcomes us to ""The future! The future!,"" Rad Times Xpress IV doesn't shy away from referencing Herrema's notorious junkie past, as ""Foxy Playground"" recounts all the times and ways she ""could've died."" But instead of playing up the pathos of that sentiment, the song's slinky bounce effectively plays it for laughs, and for good reason: Twenty-four years into her musical career and still busting skulls, Jennifer Herrema is not about to let a little rumination on mortality get in the way of a rad time.","Black Bananas boasts the same personnel as Jennifer Herrema's other post-Royal Trux band, but she fashions it as an alternate-universe RTX, one that isn't afraid to absorb modern influences like synth-pop, hip-hop, French-touch house.

Old Ideas,Leonard Cohen,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3389d034d5c69bf4cab/1:1/w_160/0d803d0e.jpeg,2012-02-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16228-leonard-cohen-old-ideas/,Columbia,"Old Ideas is, in its own tender, smirking, Leonard Cohen-y way, a clever title. In one sense, the ideas here are ones we've heard from Cohen before: Life is a nostalgic, sorrowful experience punctuated by the occasional joke; language can clarify as much as it can obscure; and lust is one of the highest forms of prayer. In another sense, Cohen is telling us that the ideas on this album-- home, healing, origins, and endings-- are ideas that take on a starker, more metaphorical weight as time goes on. We can trust Cohen to know: Over the past 77 years, he has, in a graceful but inevitable way, become old. Cohen's voice has always sounded deep, flat, and naturalistic-- the kind of performance that attempts to sound like it's no performance at all. To describe the changes in it over the past 10 or 15 years, I defer in part to those little booklets that come around the necks of good Scotch: A powerful body of peat smoke with a briny finish. In essence, a whisper-- the voice of a voice whose center has been carved away. Old Ideas doesn't remind me of Bob Dylan as much it does of late Johnny Cash records, or even Charlie Louvin's Steps to Heaven: documents of voices so heavy and close that to hear them is to smell the singer's breath and see the gradient of yellow on their teeth. It's easy to think of Cohen as a folksinger since ""folksinger"" is common shorthand for musicians who tend to privilege words over music. Cohen, though, tends to go where his musical collaborators and arrangers lead him, whether it's grimy dive-bar ballads, disco, bare-bones guitar blues, or orchestral elaborations. For a Zen monk who started his career as a poet, Leonard Cohen has used a lot of synth horns. Old Ideas is a spare, low-key album rooted in blues and gospel-- maybe the closest thing he's made to ""folk"" music since the early 1970s. Backup singers sing passionate, wordless melodies; the bass sounds like the big, upright kind. I think it's his first studio album in 20 years to not rely exclusively on drum machines for percussion. The musical setting suits the state of his voice, which is meant as a mixed compliment: One of the great things about hearing his 1980s and 1990s albums was trying to reconcile his heroic presence with all the Casios. Some of the best moments on Old Ideas-- like the bizarre foregrounding of synthesizer during the album's first thirty seconds-- prove that Cohen and his collaborators have the wits to remind listeners that as soon as tape is rolling, nothing-- no croak, no wail, no plea-- is all-natural. Cohen's voice alone, though, is a gorgeous, singular instrument. It carries in it a quality that is difficult to discuss without either becoming sentimental or appealing to the misguided idea that just because you play an acoustic guitar or sing close to the microphone, what you do is more honest than someone who attempts to create an experience of truth in some other way. It's a voice that mimics states of human yearning: The point at which we start to sound too tired or worn-down to speak, the point at which we start to cry, the way we whisper to people whom we are very, very close. Maybe it's only context that makes me think that songs such as ""Show Me the Place"", where his voice becomes so weak it nearly falls silent in the middle of a line, is anything more than maudlin. Maybe the past 40-plus years of music serve as some kind of apology, as though to publicly reckon with the fact that according to the World Bank you are fast approaching life expectancy is something Cohen-- or any human being-- needs to earn their right to. This is not the best album Cohen has put out. It is also not The Bucket List-- certainly not cheap or trivial or trading on his age alone. The songs are decent, the singing is stunning. He claims to be naked and filthy. He claims to be a lazy bastard. He claims to have been a slave for love. But he has claimed these things before. He is as old as he has ever been.","Leonard Cohen's 12th studio LP is a spare, low-key album rooted in blues and gospel-- maybe the closest thing he's made to ""folk"" music since the early 1970s.

La Grande,Laura Gibson,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32fea9e61561daa6a50/1:1/w_160/9a0888db.jpeg,2012-01-31 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16226-la-grande/,BarsukCity SlangJealous Butcher,"Simple suits Laura Gibson. The Oregonian songstress knows the power a few well-chosen words and clear images can carry-- all the better when complemented with an economy of instrumentation-- and she put this know-how to good use on her two previous solo outings, 2006's If You Come to Greet Me and 2009's Beasts of Seasons. Those records also benefited from their intimacy and frankness, both embodied in Gibson's voice. It's a gentle thing, wise but vulnerable, and it wraps itself around the vowels with a nasal quality that calls to mind the earliest decades of recorded music. That voice returns more versatile than before on La Grande (sorry Francophones, it rhymes with ""demand""), which finds Gibson shedding some of her characteristic simplicity, spreading her wings, and trying a few new musical styles on for size in the process. A newfound momentum is evident from the moment the opening title track rolls in, all galloping drums, see-saw bass, dust-bowl guitars, and spectral moaning. It ain't exactly ""Rawhide"", but it's a more assertive move than we're used to from Gibson, whose previous records began quietly and gracefully. From there La Grande dips and sways, holes up and sprawls out again, not unlike the rugged terrain of the northeastern Oregon locale from which the album derives its name. Gibson's quiet moments are still her most striking: ""Crow/Swallow"" comes close to capturing the elegant melancholy of Greet Me standout ""Broken Bottle"", while on closing track ""Feather Lungs"" Gibson makes use of a cappella 1940s vocal-group harmonizations to soften the edges of a song plainly about final repose. However it's thanks to more upbeat tracks such as ""The Fire"", ""Skin, Warming Skin"", and the aforementioned opener that these more intimate offerings shine in contrast. This, perhaps, is a lesson learned from Beasts, where a stream of pared-down tracks on the record's latter half, while each affecting on its own, tended to smear together in succession. New sounds of yore continue on ""Lion/Lamb"", with its bossa nova rhythm, and ""The Rushing Dark"", which drifts in and out like an old spiritual sung from a passing river barge. ""Skin"", easily the record's most momentous track, is, appropriately, also its sex jam: Lines about ""secrets... hidden in the hems of summer dresses"" and leaving ""seeds to break and swell"" alternate with a rousing wordless chorus of ""ooh-ooh-oohs"" while our narrator must keep reminding herself, ""it's only skin, warming skin, warming skin."" Meanwhile, the romance that may well have led to such skin-warming is given its due on ""Red Moon"", which has Gibson expressing her desire to ""drink up"" her lover's ""poetry"" on what sounds like a vintage microphone. This comes served over Latin-inflected guitar and a recurring sample of an old waltz record, all new looks for the usually more restrained Gibson. Rather than another exercise in genre-dabbling and dilettantism, La Grande succeeds as a cohesive work thanks to the persistence of Gibson's vision. As a songwriter she's preoccupied with those timeless questions of the human condition, but seldom if ever stumbles into pretension or self-satisfaction. Themes of love, loss, regret, and mortality crop up often, and, significantly, they're well-served by the surrounding songcraft. One wouldn't expect Gibson's latest to bowl over any audiophile chasing the wow!-factor, but for the patient, contemplative listener, La Grande-- much like the campfire depicted on its cover-- is a record worth warming to.","The Oregon songstress spreads her wings and tries a few new styles on for size while keeping her earthly vision intact.

Earth Has Doors,Wymond Miles,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3399d034d5c69bf4cad/1:1/w_160/e7d37951.jpeg,2012-01-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16229-earth-has-doors/,Sacred Bones,"Though the creative nucleus of the Fresh & Onlys consists of frontman Tim Cohen and bassist Shayde Sartin, guitarist Wymond Miles is an equally valuable component of the band. Of course he is: It's not like he's a second-chair French horn player for Arcade Fire, he's the lead guitarist of a relatively straightforward garage-rock quartet. Aside from being 25% of the band, his work is integral to the group's success: It's difficult imagining what ""Grey-Eyed Girls"" would sound like without his rippling, jangly leads or ""August in My Mind"" and ""Waterfall"" minus his Morricone-in-a-punk-basement fretwork. But regardless of how essential he is to his group, being a guitarist is only one of many forms of musical expression, which is why many sidemen fiddle around with solo projects. That said, Earth Has Doors feels like the diametric opposite of ""fiddling around."" The same could be said about his life. After writing these songs hunched over an eight-track four years ago, Miles shelved his solo work in favor of responsibilities familial (he has a child), professional (the Fresh & Onlys are currently gearing up to release a new album, their fourth in the past 36 months), and intellectual (he has a degree in the humanities). The latter is clearly displayed on the EP, which has been presented as a rumination on the deep sense of existentialism that strikes many people approaching their thirties. But instead of looking inside of himself and realizing his life is insignificant in the bigger picture, Miles faces the lens outward, touching on the initial allure and subsequent emptiness of drugs, the vapidity of consumer culture, and even the metaphysical. He's explained what he was trying to accomplish: ""Sonically the mood had to reflect the somberness of moving between the existential chaos of my 20s into this new perspective of living... The mysterious hues of the soundscape reflect a sense of curiosity and possibility in the canyons of sound."" In laymen's terms, the EP quickly taps into 1960s and 1970s prog bluster, complete with song titles long enough to require commas. The 12"" is split into two sides, and Side A is the more song-based of the two, with the soundscapes taking a backseat to two dramatic tunes. Its opener softly picks an acoustic guitar and before long, everything is blasted skyward and the song feels spacious and ominous at the same time, like a helicopter hovering over a field. ""Temples of Magick"" is miles heavier, using tiny bits of squall that squeal in the background. Miles sings in an incredibly wearied voice toward the end of the song, as the mood cascades from eerie to dramatic to back again. Side B begins with ""As the Orchard is With Rain"", a floaty, melancholy instrumental, featuring the ambiance of gusty wind, guitar with rapid drop-of-a-dime tempo changes, and a few droning violins circling underneath the sound of thunder (aka a few noisy guitars). The final track ""Earth Has Doors, Let Them Open"" features vintage synths overwhelmingly high in the mix while Miles let's out a battle cry to open these proverbial doors, before the song breaks down into a agonizingly slow coda that, like much of the EP, feels longer than it actually is. Really, with an EP so dramatic and high-concept, it's almost a wonder it came out of the Fresh & Onlys camp. That's another thing about solo projects: It's like Miles felt the stakes for this were astronomically high, even if nobody else knew it.","The Fresh & Onlys lead guitarist has produced a dramatic, high-concept solo EP that taps into 1960s and 1970s prog bluster, complete with song titles long enough to require commas.

"936 Remixes 12"" / 936 Remixed EP",Peaking Lights,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b343ea9e61561daa6a75/1:1/w_160/92a9dfcc.jpg,2012-01-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16235-remixes-936-remixed-ep/,Weird World,"The two full-lengths from Wisconsin-to-California duo Peaking Lights make the band alumni of both the Night-People and Not Not Fun labels. If you find that part of their biography a bit incomprehensible, you may also be unaware that their 2011 full-length, *936, *was something of a triumph among the subset of music fans who still buy cassettes. Peaking Lights are currently at the heart of a new crop of underground, psychedelic pop groups. Their primitive sun worship is underpinned by a murky foundation of dub and drone, the layers filtered through the aural equivalent of a Xerox machine. You feel as if you are listening in on Peaking Lights, and their mantric hit ""All the Sun That Shines"" has always reminded me of a description the poet Allen Ginsberg once offered of Arthur Russell: ""Buddhist bubblegum."" Peaking Lights are DIY in a raw sense; co-leader Aaron Coyes even makes his own synthesizers. That detail is worth rehashing as a reminder that the group has thus far produced distinctly bohemian music. Its slow, deadpan atmosphere could be most appropriately paired with incense and burning candles. But between the layers of 936's hissy meanderings, there's a lot of breathing room, making the songs prime canvases for remixing. Not Not Fun began commissioning a remix EP for its dance-oriented imprint 100% Silk in February 2011, but in the time required to finalize the release, Peaking Lights signed to Domino's Weird World label and issued a separate collection. The most successful reworkings on these releases are those that leave Peaking Lights' meditative character intact. While the idea of L.A.'s ""Ambassador of Boogie Funk"" Dâm-Funk remixing anything sounds worthy of a few spins, his take on ""All the Sun That Shines"" for Weird World is more or less a cover, transforming the track with a slick sheen and subtle four-on-the-floor click. It's imaginative and well executed, but by the nature of being a Dâm-Funk creation, it compromises Peaking Lights' earthy, breathing tones for something a little too polished. It feels as though it'd work better as his own B-side. The same goes for Oakland zoner-rap duo Main Attrakionz, who use elements of ""Marshmellow Yellow"" and ""Amazing and Wonderful"" as cloud-ground for a few skilled verses. Electronic duo Patten turn ""Hey Sparrow"" into something more esoteric, but drag it out to the point of feeling unedited. What the Weird World comp lacks is cohesion, which is unfortuante since dub and reggae connoisseur Adrian Sherwood's impressive remake of ""Tiger Eyes (Laid Back)"" is easily the best cut on either set. The British producer maintains the song's atmosphere and relaxed mystique, but makes its production boom, burying a subtle swarm of laser-like synths under crisp vocal melodies. The 100% Silk EP draws its remixers straight from the label's own pool of DIY dance producers, who since last year have emphasized a specific, low-budget sound inspired by Italo disco and early Detroit house and techno. It's hypnagogic dance music for misfits and outsiders, pinning a punk philosophy to one indebted in some sense to Ariel Pink and YouTube's endless free music archive. Ital's Daniel Martin-McCormick, who also fronts the punk trio Mi Ami, offers a standout expansion of ""Marshmellow Yellow"", adding a driving beat and thudding bass that quicken the original's pace while maintaining its two-dimensional cool. Xander Harris adds spiky, galactic synths to ""Birds of Paradise"", shedding the song of its echo wash while building the electronics in isolated layers, reminiscent of Peaking Lights' own technique. No remix of ""All the Sun That Shines"" is a match for the album cut's alien sing-song charm, but Innergaze offer a welcome twist with warped vocal samples and a cosmic chug. On ""Tiger Eyes"", Cuticle pushes the vocals high and swaps gloom for wavering, sky-high synths. The 100% Silk EP calls for repeat listens due to its maintenance of 936's cohesive, textured voice, and even more so for carrying on the album's ethos.","Following their excellent psych-pop breakthrough 936, Peaking Lights return with two very different remix EPs.

Anthology: 1992 to 2012,Underworld,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b340c0084474cd0c20c3/1:1/w_160/6a08e338.jpeg,2012-01-31 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16234-the-anthology-1982-to-2012/,Cooking Vinyl,"Even when Underworld weren't big, they always aimed at being huge. I don't just mean the widescreen progressive house they made, two decades of which are collected on the 25 tracks of the new Anthology, but their brand of not-quite-trance/not-quite-techno floor-fillers were indeed self-consciously epic and transportive. Following the late-1980s acid-house revelation that turned so many UK synth-pop also-rans into DJ kings, Underworld came to specialize in the kind of dance music that felt constrained in a tiny club space, records with enough space and depth to lose yourself in the swirl and flow, whether you were standing in a festival field surrounded by thousands of other bodies or strapped into a pair of headphones on your lonesome. Underworld had a live rock band's feel for pacing and drama, but were born-again house music evangelists, through and through. ""Dark and Long (Dark Train)"" was the structuring principle for music of their peak music, as well as the title of one of their deepest, moodiest cuts. Despite Karl Hyde's nagging half-spoken and half-sung mantras, Underworld never really flirted with ""songwriting."" Though his fragmentary, pre-millennium tension babble could be equally silly, Hyde wasn't the grimacing focal point of Underworld, as the two MCs were in the Prodigy. Even when they were stars, taking to festival stages rather than DJ booths, Underworld never tried to be personalities, letting DJ culture continue to dictate the shape and force and presentation of their music. Unlike unrepentant hookmeister Norman Cook, Underworld also didn't go for big-stoopid-chorus and earworm-loop immediacy, even when forced to shave their singles down to broadcast length. They simply attempted to recreate the peaks-and-valleys of a club cut in miniature. ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" may be more head-wrecking at its proper length, but the video version was like a hyper-condensed advert for the same effect, angelic intro giving way to massive hard house drums that are the song's real hook. This dance essentialism disguised as crossover friendliness may have limited their appeal to pop fans once the ""electronica"" boom went pfft and many fair-weather compilation buyers realized they really didn't care for 12-minute instrumentals after all. But it makes Underworld ripe for rediscovery by a generation of new college kids who've dedicated themselves to recreating the 1990s house music they were barely alive for. After all, if you've got to go retro, go big. It's no surprise that Anthology collects these tracks at their full 12""-mix lengths, rather than their highlight reel-style radio edits. All the more for you to swim around in. And those peaks certainly take you higher when the builds have been teased out to the limit. Plenty of DJs and producers have made ""huge"" dance records that nonetheless feel rather small as pop artifacts because they're aimed at insular subcultures. Several of Underworld's biggest records, in the musical sense of the word, were recorded and released when they were indeed club-circuit draw on the rise and a music press rumor to the wider world, especially in America. 1993's ""Rez"", which builds with the controlled grandeur of pre-cheesy continental trance but uses much of Detroit techno's sonic signature, would have been no one's idea of a chart smash. Its melodic hook is too abstract. Its repetitive structure is still aimed at all-night dancing rather than earworm immediacy. But the track's whole vibe is also too big to ignore, as if it's straining to some DJ's crates for a suburban pop-techno radio utopia that didn't yet exist. If so many of these singles still sound like world-flattening anthems today, more than a decade after Underworld's commercial peak, it's partially due to the overwhelming ambition the music still projects, the idea that through luck and timing and canny cross-media promotion and a kind of benign will-to-power, they could bring (mostly) instrumental electronic music to a mass audience. They got their wish, though only many years into their career and after several failed attempts that have more or less been airbrushed from their official history. This most recent best-of collection is subtitled ""1992 to 2012"" because 20 years makes a respectable round number for official retrospection. But you'd be hard-pressed to claim their earliest albums, where the best you can say is that they pulled a half-decent sartorial imitation of Depeche Mode on the sleeve art, as part of the band's real legacy. Acid house's sweeping the UK in 1988 both freed them from silly pop preening and pointed out that their real strength was in stringing together adrenaline-pumping climaxes along spacious beatscapes. They had a good run, about as long as any of their peers, and the idyllic ambient house and blown-out filter disco sieved from 2002's A Hundred Days Off for Anthology promised good things for how Underworld would weather the rapid trend-shifts of new millennium dance. Then the great house contraction occurred, and suddenly Underworld (like so many of their peers) seemed massively out-of-step with the gaunt form dance hipness took with minimal. Almost a decade later, huge is back, in many forms, but what you hear now, with Underworld's particular brand of hugeness no longer the face of dance populism, is how it's the subtlety that keeps these anthems repeat-listenable, as much as the hands-aloft moments. Damned as dance music afflicted with gigantism when techno started starving itself of hooks, Underworld were masters of restraint, nuance, and pace compared to today's prole-friendly producers, such as Skrillex and Deadmau5. There's all the attention to detail of your average deep house bore, along with a lot of pleasing bombast and (it must be said) some pretty damn dodgy lyrics. Don't play them for any neon-clad goobers craving only the biggest bass drops, but if you're looking for a long and dark journey that eventually arrives at euphoria, you could still do a lot worse.","This 25-song ""best of"" compilation collects two decades of Underworld's widescreen progressive house at 12""-mix lengths, rather than the highlight reel-style radio edits.

Tramp,Sharon Van Etten,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b337b1335d7bf169a55e/1:1/w_160/5bf87fab.jpeg,2012-01-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16233-tramp/,Jagjaguwar,"Sharon Van Etten's first proper album, Because I Was in Love, was nudged out into the world in 2009 despite the best efforts of a college boyfriend in Tennessee who had told her she was shit, hid her guitar, and shoved her back home to New Jersey. That album's tracks, and those of the home recordings she also released that year, were sparse, Van Etten's voice sometimes barely above a murmur, as if she were trying to figure out how to make music at the lowest functional volume. Her next record, 2010's Epic, was almost more of an EP-- just seven songs-- but it was a leap forward in sound and spirit. Epic pulled in little bits of kickdrum and pedal steel and electric guitar, and ended with ""Love More"", on which she proclaimed, over a doubled harmonium and wavering synth, ""You chained me like a dog in our room/ …It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more."" Van Etten first recorded ""Love More"" for WXPN and Weathervane Music's Shaking Through web series, which captured the session on video. It was one of her first in-earnest collaborations with other musicians, and can almost see new synapses firing behind her eyes: this is what music can be, this is what I can be. It's fitting that the same song grabbed the attention of the National's Aaron Dessner, who wound up producing Tramp, her first album for Jagjaguwar. The new tracks come from a year and a half of sessions wedged in whenever Dessner and Van Etten were both off tour. It includes appearances by Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, Julianna Barwick, Dessner's brother/bandmate Bryce, and other friends of the sort that apparently tend to ""just drop by"" when you're a celebrated musician/producer with a studio in your Brooklyn garage. That Van Etten has been given the time and space and resources to feel out her path, unhurried by the tyrannous buzz cycle, is both a total luxury, and totally vital. It's the default assumption that a female songwriter, performing under her own name, is ""confessional,"" that she's serving up some dark part of her soul for the world's consumption. And maybe one day Van Etten will slip into the voices of strangers just as easily as she inhabits her own. But for now, confession is still very much the thing. ""It's self-therapy,"" Van Etten has said to nearly every interviewer who has asked, and more and more that seems to refer to both the writing and the production of her songs; that she can draw out the words, bring them into a room with other human beings, and together with them lay something beautiful on tape is both transformative and redemptive. Matters of mistrust, isolation, and uncomfortable togetherness dominate Tramp, rolling through every track like a sick, creeping fog. Maybe Van Etten is still nursing the psychic wounds carved into her by that one Tennessee boyfriend, or maybe it's something else; either way, she sounds, at last, good and angry and ready to put up a fight. First comes the dark jangle of ""Warsaw"", then the calculated frankness of ""Give Out"" (""You're the reason why I'll move to the city/ Or why I'll need to leave”). On ""Serpents"", the album's lead single, she scoffs, ""I had a thought you would take me seriously."" As guitars strain at their tethers and Walkmen drummer Matt Barrick pounds out marching orders, the plea she issued three years ago on ""Much More Than That""-- ""please don’t take me lightly""-- quavers, crumples, turns to ash. After the torching comes the slow, steady burn. ""Kevin's"" sounds like an Epic latecomer welcomed into Tramp's fold, Van Etten’s voice, falling somewhere between Cass Elliot's range and Cat Power's emotional register, turns darker and resigned, the whole song one long smoky exhale. ""Leonard"" is a dreamy, abashed waltz; tickled by ukuleles and kicked along by a big bass drum; it reveals the album's lone confession that seems to stem from anything close to guilt. It's an admission that takes three go-rounds of the chorus to make itself fully known, Van Etten shuffling around the hard truth: ""I am bad""-- ""I am bad at loving""-- ""I am bad at loving you."" The album's brightest spot comes with the steady, strummy ""We Are Fine"", in which Van Etten talks through a panic attack with a friend (""Take my hand and help me not to shake/ Say I'm all right, I'm all right""). Beirut's Zach Condon sings harmonies and a verse of his own, the song written with him in mind, Van Etten says, not just because she first plucked it out on a ukulele, but because they both do battle with the gnarly beast of social anxiety. There's often no clear balm for Van Etten's laments, but ""We Are Fine"" is both the means and the end, the sickness and the cure in one. Tramp is maybe best thought of in terms of having a Side A and a Side B; otherwise, the middle section falls into a weird mid-album slough that doesn't quite jibe with Van Etten and Dessner's generally excellent sense of timing and space. Imagine a click, a pause and a careful flip between the fractured, meandering ""In Line"" and ""All I Can"", which starts with a mewling organ hum and gradually wills itself into blistering hugeness. That song might have worked, too, as a big closer; the seething ""Joke or a Lie"" serves better as a feint than a final attack. As it is, the album doesn't end so much as infinitely loop on itself (serpents, indeed), the last track's final scrape threading back into ""Warsaw""'s opening thump and clank. ""I want my scars to help and heal,"" Van Etten sings on ""All I Can"". That healing comes, in part, from the making of the music-- that act of physically locating the pain in some way that can be accessed and then shelved as life tumbles on. But it comes, too, from being pushed out into the world, to people who now say, ""Yes, we are here, and we are listening.""","The Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter's powerful third album, produced by the National's Aaron Dessner, features guest spots from Beirut's Zach Condon, Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, Julianna Barwick, and Dessner's brother Bryce, among others.

Astronaut Status,Future,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3279d034d5c69bf4c96/1:1/w_160/ac50781b.jpeg,2012-01-30 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16217-astronaut-status/,self-released,"If success brings expectations, then Future is at the point where his mixtapes are starting to matter. With a handful of major and minor hits and recent placements on albums by Young Jeezy and Rick Ross, Future has a major-label debut somewhere on the horizon, but the album will undoubtedly languish if he can't keep his momentum going. Astronaut Status is his first big move of the year, and though the tape doesn't really bring much of anything new to the table, it is Future's strongest, most listenable mixtape yet, and that alone is notable enough. As much as any of his mixtapes, Astronaut Status puts Future's talents as a songwriter at the forefront. There's nothing here that's elaborate or notably deep, and in fact Future trades on his ability to write quirky, catchy little songs that you could easily picture as playground chants. There is an inclination in the rap world to tag songs likes these as disposable, but the ruthless efficiency in Future's writing makes these tracks endure, even if it's in your head and against your will. There's a circular, almost music-box quality to tracks like ""Nunbout"" and ""Swap it Out"", with Future driving the same idea and melody into the ground, that gives them an organic, homespun feel. It wouldn't be a stretch to imagine these songs as one-takes, or not being built up much further from demos, but sometimes melodies are indelible enough that they don't really need much more than that. The playground element of the songs is important-- plenty of rap songs have liberally interpolated actual playground classics, though Future's ability to mine the space between seriousness and something close to childish taunting is unique. Future has said in interviews that he wants to make stadium music, and though that's enough of a jump in ambition that it could lead him down a disastrous path, he does succeed on Astronaut Status when he widens his scope or pushes himself vocally. The obvious standout in this regard is ""Deeper Than the Ocean"", a track with Spanish guitars and a squealing solo that finds Future singing in a cracked, raspy voice about the pain in his life. The sentiment is real and the lyrics a bit jarring, even if the execution is slightly ridiculous-- but it would only be a small leap of faith to close your eyes and imagine Future as Adele performing ""Someone Like You"" at the Brit Awards. Elsewhere, ""Spaz on Y'all"" and ""Birds Take a Bath"" are more conventionally anthemic, but nonetheless show that Future is capable of picking off where Akon left off, which I promise is more important than it sounds. Future could likely go on like this forever, prolifically releasing mixtapes with more than enough good songs to justify their existence. At some point, he will need to strike gold again, and in the murky waters of pop-rap hitmaking, it's hard to tell if anything on Astronaut Status stands up to the songs that helped Future ascend to this status in the first place. Until all of that shakes out, though, we can do just fine enjoying his catchy, goofy songs as they are.","With a handful of hits, placements on albums by Young Jeezy and Rick Ross, and a major-label debut on the horizon, the Atlanta rapper's new mixtape is his first big move of the year.

Be Strong,The 2 Bears,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3345e6ef95969322407/1:1/w_160/e6f0d111.jpeg,2012-01-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16224-be-strong/,DFASouthern Fried,"Raf Rundell and Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, who are both straight, call themselves the 2 Bears in homage of the gay subculture mostly because they fit the bill aesthetically but also as homage to the vanguards of the dance music they love. ""We have huge respect for the pioneers of house music and nightclubbing-- some of them were gay,"" Rundell, aka DJ Raf Daddy, said an interview. Based on that description, you might expect hands-in-the-air club sounds from this project (and there is some of that) but Be Strong is primarily about pop-- the kind that is gooey, uplifting, and occasionally goofy. The thing that stands out immediately (and is immediately likable) about the record is just how earnest these guys are about their optimism. The quotes ""Love is lovely"" and ""war is ugly"" show up on the album and its sleeve, and nearly every track details some kind of fondness-- of a partner, of a band, of a friend or just someone you bumped into on the dancefloor. (Seems like the Care Bears could have also worked as a band name, and in fact the furry gang appears in the video for ""Church"".) This heart-on-sleeve emoting is something Goddard and co. did very well on Hot Chip's One Life Stand, and it works here much the same way it did on tracks such as ""Brothers"": simple sentiments expressed simply over music that buoys the sweet parts and gives weight to the more serious stretches. If Be Strong is all about adoration, the biggest recipient of it is music itself. On these songs, Rundell and Goddard rep and rework lots of their personal favorites. One track is called ""Heart of the Congos"", for the classic reggae LP of the same name, and artists such as Kraftwerk, Wiley, Hot City, and Steely Dan all get shoutouts along the way. This is definitely what Simon Reynolds would call ""record-collector rock,"" and I'm generally with him about the pitfalls of artists' constantly looking backwards, but these guys pull it off. For one, they tend to be futurist in their nostalgia, able to not just reinterpret but recontextualize things like rave or Chicago house. Also, there's a fan-like purity in the way they sing about the stuff-- you can tell how much it means to them. It's worth noting that Be Strong occasionally veers into silly territory to the extent that you can't really forget it's a side project. There are tracks, like ""Bear Hug"", sort of a twerked-up ""Humpty Dance"" (key line: ""All you out there on the floor, gonna get you in my paws and give you a bear hug""), that would definitely not make the final cut of a Hot Chip album. But the guys' commitment to music-as-fun and big, croon-y hooks (Goddard's velvet vocals sound as good as ever here) keeps it enjoyable throughout. The key, though, is that Goddard and Rundell set out to make something sentimental and happy-sounding and never bothered to worry if it seemed cool or not to do so. A relatively low-stakes project, sure, but for a small album, it's got a big heart.","This side project from Hot Chip's Joe Goddard and Raf Rundell make a goofy and big-hearted homage to the club-friendly pop they love.

Vacation EP,Shlohmo,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32dea9e61561daa6a48/1:1/w_160/d4a0211b.jpg,2012-01-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16219-vacation/,Friends of Friends,"With last year's excellent Bad Vibes, L.A. producer Shlohmo showed just how far the Brainfeeder template of abstract instrumental hip-hop could be stretched-- to gossamer, almost transparent extremes. An hour-long, shifting soundscape sketched out with broken drum machines, meandering guitar picking, and hushed vocals, it was as if Mount Kimbie were let loose in the wilderness of Southern California, all scorching sun and and dried, burned landscapes. The soft and pseudo-naturalistic direction was a sharp left-turn for Henry Laufer, who had mostly made synth- and sample-heavy takes on distorted hip-hop before then. He continues down that moss-grown path with the Vacation EP, a more focused and confident take on Bad Vibes' landscape paintings. Opener ""The Way U Do"" is firmly in the Shlohmo style: dripping water, those familiar percussive rimshots (taken far outside their house music context), and a slippery sense of time, as if Laufer can't help but let his beats slide out of order every single bar. But the song's strengths lie in its melody: Pairing a distorted riff with an extended vocal sample, Laufer plays a sort of virtuoso conductor with his faceless vocalist, stretching out melisma into twirling, elongated lines and elegant loops, distorting it so it sounds fluid and constant like a guitar solo. Mixed in with the dragging-feet bassline and moping percussion, the emphasis here is on searing pain and heart-tugging emotion, nicely expanding on Bad Vibes' often detached prettiness. The meek and plaintive ""wen uuu"" further ratchets up the percussion, but this time it's a bumpy zig-zag of makeshift drums leaving just enough room for a different kind of vocal sampling. Chopping up vocal syllables into fine pieces, the song finds its own beauty in a synchronized jerky stutter, occasionally climaxing in those sublime moments of beauty (the titular ""when you"" vocal) that mark the best of Shlohmo's recent work. ""Rained the Whole Time"" rounds things off a little more business-as-usual, a Bad Vibes holdover of bluesy guitar rubbing against knotted basslines and rattling drums. Vacation is an ideal stop-gap EP, taking the sound of the album it follows and tightening it up just a little bit, closing the story as it were on Bad Vibes' holistic journey. You won't find a gentler, more ruminative take on Brainfeeder-style beats anywhere, and for someone whose work used to sound charmingly homemade, the processing mastery here is impressive. The EP packs a lot of power into a mere three tracks.","The L.A.-based beatmaker follow's last year's album, Bad Vibes, with a brief and beautiful three-song EP that shows an expanding mastery of sound manipulation.

Strange Weekend,Porcelain Raft,by: Josh Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31e5e6ef959693223dc/1:1/w_160/ea632a71.jpeg,2012-01-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16208-strange-weekend/,Secretly Canadian,"Mauro Remiddi, who currently records as Porcelain Raft, has covered an impressive amount of physical and aesthetic terrain in his years as a working musician. Italian-born Remiddi's wanderings have led him to playing indie pop in London, gypsy klezmer music with the traveling Berlin Youth Circus, piano in off-Broadway productions, and even to performing in North Korea. Considering how much globetrotting Remiddi has under his belt, it's no surprise that his music might start to evoke a sense of rootlessness and impermanence. However, as Porcelain Raft, he's taken it to the logical extreme of sounding like he no longer exists on this planet. On Strange Weekend, Porcelain Raft's debut full-length effort, Remiddi sounds like nothing if not a weary sojourner resigned to endlessly floating through the interstellar or spiritual cosmos. His forerunners in this respect are Marc Bolan, John Lennon, and David Bowie, performers who consistently sought some kind of transcendence of the corporeal, struggling to achieve earthly connections and understanding while chafing against the bounds of time and space. Song titles like ""Drifting in and Out"", ""Shapeless & Gone"", and ""Put Me to Sleep"" give an excellent idea of what Remiddi has in store. Porcelain Raft borrows liberally from both the shoegaze and dream-pop playbooks, and so we get layers of sonic gauze shot through with delicately strummed acoustic guitar patterns and Remiddi's reedy, rather androgynous voice. In the spacey somnolence applied to venerable classic rock sounds and structures-- Lennon's most obviously on  ""Unless You Speak From Your Heart"", Bolan's on ""Picture""-- Remiddi very much shares a kinship with Beach House. There's some of Porcelain Raft touring partner M83's elegant sweep here too, while the woozy, hypnotic beatscapes of ""Is It Deep Enough For You"" and ""If You Have a Wish"" aren't far removed at all from chillwavers like Neon Indian. Many of the melodies feel familiar but can't easily be precisely placed, which not only makes them good earworm candidates but also enhances the album's dreamlike, half-remembered feel. The record's pervading sense of wistfulness and resignation extends to the lyrics-- they're often buried or abstracted, but occasionally something nakedly direct emerges, like the ingenuous sentiment conveyed in the title of ""Unless You Speak From Your Heart"", or, perhaps a bit more artfully, Remiddi's assertion in ""Backwords"" that ""I hope you're in a nice hotel/ Playing cards in your room/ With someone who cares over you."" As you'd expect from such a bleary, atmospheric album, Strange Weekend hangs together well as a whole-cloth statement, though that doesn't mean there aren't standouts, particularly ""Backwords"", with its exhausted grandeur reminiscent of Pink Floyd, as well as the gorgeous ""Put Me to Sleep"", which seems tailor-made to soundtrack a scene where Carey Mulligan is sad in some major metropolitan city. Which is presumably a situation to which a well-traveled melancholic like Remiddi can readily relate.","The Italian-born pop artist Mauro Remiddi has covered an impressive amount of physical and aesthetic terrain in his years as a working musician.

Born to Die,Lana Del Rey,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3309d034d5c69bf4ca7/1:1/w_160/76cd0167.jpeg,2012-01-30 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/,Interscope,"What happens to a dream fulfilled? More specifically, an American dream fulfilled, rags turning to riches with the snap of a manicured finger, kissing James Dean in Gatsby's swimming pool, getting played on the radio. This is a central question animating Lana Del Rey's Born to Die. Our heroine has all the love, diamonds, and Diet Mountain Dew she could ask for, yet still sings, ""I wish I was dead,"" sounding utterly incapable of joy. To paraphrase Liz Phair, if you get everything you wish for and you're still unhappy, then you know that the problem is you. Given the waves of hype and backlash over the last six months, it can be easy to forget that we're here, first and foremost, because of a song. ""Video Games"" struck a nerve not just because it was an introduction to Del Rey's captivating voice but because it seemed to suggest something as-yet-unarticulated about the way we live today. Whatever her intention, as a metaphor about disconnect and detachment from our own desires, ""Video Games"" felt frank, pointed, and true, and it had a chord progression and melody to match. The ultimate disappointment of Born to Die, then, is how out of touch it feels not just with the world around it, but with the simple business of human emotion. The singer born Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Grant may have made her mark with a grainy homemade video that brought to mind other grainy homemade videos in the indie sphere, but the slick sound and sentiment of ""Radio"", Born to Die's most straightforward statement of purpose (""Baby love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio/ How do you like me now?""), places it firmly within the realm of big-budget chart pop. Born to Die was produced by Emile Haynie, whose credits include Eminem, Lil Wayne, and Kid Cudi, and the album's impressively lush atmosphere might be the one thing that will unite its detractors and apologists. The album's recurring themes ooze out of every note: sex, drugs, and glitter hover in the yawning atmosphere around Del Rey's breathy vocals. There are strings and trip-hop beats and bits of 1950s twang, and the melodies, assembled with assistance from hired-gun songwriters like Mike Daly (Plain White Ts, Whiskeytown) and Rick Nowels (Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"") are built to stick. But for an album that aims for fickle radio listeners, many of its pop signifiers feel stale and ill-fitting. On ""Million Dollar Man"", Del Rey drawls like a highly medicated Fiona Apple, and ""Diet Mountain Dew"" and ""Off to the Races"" aim for chatty, sparkling opulence, this singer doesn't have the personality to bring it off. The album's point of view-- if you could call it that-- feels awkward and out of date. Whether you take a line like ""Money is the reason we exist/ Everybody knows that it's a fact/ Kiss kiss"" with a 10-carat grain of salt is up to you, but even as a jab at the chihuahua-in-Paris-Hilton's-handbag lifestyle, it feels limp and pointless (unlike, say, Lily Allen's mock-vapid but slyly observant 2008 single ""The Fear""). Still, the dollar signs in its eyes aren't an inherent strike against Born to Die: Even in the wake of an international debt crisis and the Occupy movement, it was hard not to fall for Watch the Throne. But that's because Jay and Kanye made escapist fantasy sound so fun. Del Rey's gem-encrusted dreamworld, meanwhile, relies on clichés (""God you're so handsome/ Take me to the Hamptons"") rather than specific evocations. It's a fantasy world that makes you long for reality. And speaking of fantasy: The conversation surrounding Lana Del Rey has underscored some seriously depressing truths about sexism in music. She was subjected to the kind of intense scrutiny-- about her backstory and especially her appearance-- that's generally reserved for women only. But the sexual politics of Born to Die are troubling too: You'd be hard pressed to find any song on which Del Rey reveals an interiority or figures herself as anything more complex than an ice-cream-cone-licking object of male desire (a line in ""Blue Jeans"", ""I will love you till the end of time/ I would wait a million years,"" sums up about 65% of the album's lyrical content). Even when Del Rey offers something that could be read as a critique (""This is what makes us girls/ We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first""), she asks that we make no effort to change, escape, or transcend the way things are (""Don't cry about it/ Don't cry about it."") In terms of its America-sized grandeur and its fixation with the emptiness of dreams, Born to Die attempts to serve as Del Rey's own beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy, but there's no spark and nothing at stake. The critic Ellen Willis once wrote of Bette Midler: ""Blatant artifice can, in the right circumstances, be poignantly honest, and she expresses the tension between image and inner self that all of us-- but especially women-- experience."" But Born to Die never allows tension or complexity into the mix, and its take on female sexuality ends up feeling thoroughly tame. For all of its coos about love and devotion, it's the album equivalent of a faked orgasm-- a collection of torch songs with no fire.","After last year's hit ""Video Games"" and the endless remixes, leaks, think-pieces, and controversy that followed, it's finally here: the major-label debut from Lana Del Rey.

Feel Me EP,Evan Voytas,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b329b1335d7bf169a54b/1:1/w_160/29be6e7a.jpeg,2012-01-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16215-evan-voytas-feel-me/,Dovecote,"If there's one thing to feel relieved about where our nostalgia-crazed moment is concerned, it's that we as a society may finally get around to losing all that annoying, self-aware awkwardness about vintage loverman R&B. The coke-chic irony, the automatic equation of wah-wah guitar with mustachioed porno kitsch, the focus on caricaturized libido at the expense of the chops of the singers who gave voice to it-- that all has to go. The alt/indie sphere did its best to work through those issues via stage-winking outlets like Har Mar Superstar and Midnite Vultures, but they were still steps towards an ability to approach the influence of Prince or Michael Jackson or Hall and Oates without requiring 15 layers of self-conscious distancing. Yet to pull it off, you need to remember that old joke about how important sincerity is: Once you learn to fake it, the rest is easy. For Evan Voytas-- a Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist singer who sounds like he had to wade his way through Beck's ""Debra"" to get to Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones""-- that kind of commitment seems completely out of his grasp. The question of whether someone really means it when an artist dredges up old sounds isn't going away anytime soon, and after a couple of EPs and an abysmal, shrill-yet-affectless cover of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", it's the only question left to ask about Voytas' music. His latest EP, Feel Me, drops as a short but grueling tour of some of the most cloying, feeble soul-without-soul to dribble lamely out of wherever. The Playskool pop-funk that Voytas mistakes for peak Jam/Lewis is sickly enough: It stumbles around to hit a few loosely modernized, synth-driven takes on half-remembered Hi Records backbeats (""When We Could All Float Away""), L.A. Doobies/Dan studio rock cut with baking powder (""You Don't Even Know Where It's At""), and perfunctory boogie funk with all the propulsive energy of a Casio preset (""Can't Let Anybody Know Who You Are""). There's actually a recurring melodic shrug in the title track that stops two notes short of the stereotypical faux-Chinese riff that Carl Douglas used for ""Kung Fu Fighting"". Sir Nose lives. But the problem above everything else is his voice-- you can't get around it, under it, or away from it, much less into it. At its most innocuous, there's a sort of Owl City twerpiness to it, a softbatch indifference trying to pass for mysterious shyness. But he also leans toward a high wail so shrill-- imagine Barry Gibb as Jon Lovitz's ""Annoying Man""-- that any potential sincerity comes across as a desperate affectation. It's drenched in this grating nasal sibilance that sounds like an eye-rolling whine no matter what the message is. And there's a noncommittal emptiness to all that pitched-up whimpering-- loosely reflected in the deep-as-their-titles themes of songs such as ""When We Could All Float Away"", ""The Weightlessness"", and ""Can't Let Anybody Know Who You Are""-- that makes it impossible to catch on to any real drive or desire. You can't feel something that doesn't feel anything.","The Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist singer's latest EP drops as a short but grueling tour of cloying soul-without-soul.

U&I,Leila,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32b5e6ef959693223f5/1:1/w_160/7b2c63c1.jpeg,2012-01-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16218-ui/,Warp,"Leila Arab's position as an outlier to the electronic music scene was firmly established through her 1998 debut, Like Weather. What's remarkable about that album is how cut adrift from the world it feels, with the London-based Iranian musician dragging a series of collaborators into a musical bubble that still now, some 14 years later, feels like a singular transmission from a unique talent. Much of it is eerily prescient; the curdled funk riff and stomach-churning lethargy of ""Don't Fall Asleep"" mirrors the kind of feeling the Weeknd have been dabbling in at the start of this decade. But, as is the case with many debut albums that set such a high bar, providing a second and third act for the stylistically assertive Like Weather proved problematic. On U&I she's taken a different tack, dumping the celebrity collaborators (Terry Hall, Martina Topley-Bird) of her 2008 record, Blood, Looms and Blooms, and even parting company with longtime singer Luca Santucci. Instead, this album finds her working with the Berlin-based American DJ and musician Mt. Sims, who provides the only vocal contributions to U&I. There have been other changes, too. The scanty arrangements of yore, filled with crooked corners and dark cracks, have mostly been papered over. In their place comes a series of tracks that contain the most straightforward music Leila has produced to date, with vast strips of pulverizing industrial noise providing the combative spine that contorts awkwardly through this record. Even when she slows things down on U&I, there's a palpable feeling of ugliness; ""In Consideration"" is pitched somewhere between uneasy operatic trills and Throbbing Gristle-style discord; ""In Motion Slow"" contains the same kind of collapse-of-utopia glassiness as early Aphex Twin tracks such as ""Heliosphan"" and ""Hedphelym"". In a sense, that's the biggest flaw with U&I-- it's too easy to feel out where Leila has been sourcing this material. Whereas before she was operating in a peculiar vacuum, now it feels like she's breathing in the same air as the rest of us. Some of the emotion has dissipated as well-- there's nothing as beautifully forlorn as the Donna Paul-sung Like Weather cut ""Feeling"" here. Instead, we get the end-of-the-world blood rush of instrumental tracks ""Activate I"" and ""Eight"", which butt up against the Mt. Sims-fronted material. The latter is often undercut by gnarled bass synth work, sometimes to stirring effect (""All of This"") and at other times edging toward the pop-nihilism of Nine Inch Nails circa-""Head Like a Hole"" (""Welcome To Your Life""). It's only when the darkness is vanquished, such as on the zesty ""(Disappointed Cloud) Anyway"" and the spidery echo of the title track, that it feels like the pair is gelling. There isn't a singular focus to any of Leila's albums-- she works best when she seems to be confounding herself with her own ideas, all cooked up by indulging unlikely impulses and allowing a series of collaborators to make an imprint on her work. Strangely, pairing with just Mt. Sims on U&I appears to have resulted in less-focused output, with the duo gradually circling a grimy musical plughole, only managing to pull themselves out via less cluttered material in the back half of the record. It's the mystery and wonder of prior Leila albums that are diluted here. The sense of anatomizing her work and not being able to figure out why it all slots together so perfectly dissipates dramatically when you're being bludgeoned by the stentorian howl of ""Welcome to Your Life"". It's unlikely Leila will take a backward step from here, as she clearly never has in the past. But she could do a lot worse than digging out Luca Santucci's phone number next time out.","Dumping the celebrity collaborators of 2008's Blood, Looms and Blooms, the London-based Iranian electronic musician's newest contains her most straightforward music to date.

To Solemn Ash,Rising,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b326c0084474cd0c2098/1:1/w_160/9d5f91b2.jpg,2012-01-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16214-to-solemn-ash/,Exile On Mainstream,"The young Danish sludge trio Rising have a familiar sound, but their ability to pen vast, melodic anthems is sharp enough that originality isn't really an issue. Especially if you're into rockers in the tradition of Baroness or Remission-era Mastodon. Unlike the more recent versions of those older groups, Rising aren't into ""experimentation."" To Solemn Ash, their 10-song debut, offers straightforward metal that may come laced with the occasional acoustic interlude, but could definitely be reproduced in the smallest, shittiest club in the world without the help of guest musicians, triggers, a psychedelic choir, or a laptop. (The collection, released across Europe in October, saw its American release earlier this month.) They've found multiple ways to come off expansive and compelling within a tight, traditional framework. In fact, To Solemn Ash goes places a 2009 EP and even a 2010 single couldn't without sounding too much different from either of the earlier efforts. Rising are ramping things up here, and honing a specific style, all without stepping outside of well-worn genre lines. The sequencing helps. Immediately likable opening track ""Mausoleum"" and ""Sea of Basalt"", the song that follows it, find bellowing vocalist/bassist Henrik Hald, guitarist/backup vocalist Jacob Krogholt, and drummer Jacob Johansen (the one new addition after their last recording) firing on all cylinders: ""Mausoleum""'s dynamics feel like tectonic shifts, and remain immensely hummable; ""Basalt"" finds them nodding at Kylesa with gruff multi-tracked vocal shouts and instrumentation that continually ebbs, crests, and regains momentum until the final bit of feedback. (Which raises a question: How do three dudes from Denmark sound so much like four or five folks from Georgia?) Rising don't maintain this focus for 48 minutes, but there are plenty of ""wow"" moments like the six-minute Torche-meets-Neurosis of the mid-tempo ""ballads"" ""Cohorts Rise"" and ""Under Callous Wings"", the frantic Converge-like riffing on the album's shortest track ""Through the Eyes of Catalysis"", and the way you feel like you can suddenly imagine High on Fire as a (very powerful) pop band while listening to ""Heir to the Flames"". The trio isn't afraid to groove or veer into somewhat poppier territory, and can pull it off without sacrificing heaviness or getting too cute: They simply know how to write great riffs, and newbie producer Jakob Reichert Nielsen should probably be giving tutorials to ""star"" recordists who don't yet know how to make metal sound huge, polished, and just-raw-enough in their more renowned studios. It's worth repeating: For all the quality, head nods, and goosebumps this album provides, Rising are, more or less, a basic sludge-metal band. And it's refreshing not having to also pull out the words ""post"" or ""avant"" to describe them.","This young Danish sludge-metal trio has a familiar sound, but the band's ability to pen vast, melodic anthems is sharp enough that originality isn't really an issue.

Patience (After Sebald),The Caretaker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32eea9e61561daa6a4c/1:1/w_160/e398d26d.jpeg,2012-01-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16220-patience-after-sebald/,History Always Favours the Winners,"Leyland Kirby has been making music as the Caretaker since 1999, but 2011 proved to be the project's breakthrough year. An Empty Bliss Beyond This World was the right record at the right time, a meditation on decay and loss that was beautiful on the surface but also had layers to peel. It reached listeners with only a passing interest in music from the experimental sphere, much in the manner of William Basinski's early-millennium series Disintegration Loops, because it brought together ideas about archives, appropriation, memory, and the accretion and disappearance of cultural objects. The name of Kirby's project comes from Jack Nicholson's character in The Shining, and Bliss was the album as a large, empty, and haunted building, imparting a feeling of loneliness at the edge of the world. Sampling and manipulating crackling 78s with sweet dance tunes from the 1920s and 1930s, Kirby's tracks dangled in front of you and turned slowly, rods on a mobile that was gradually falling apart. Following a solo album, Eager to Tear Apart the Stars, that was nearly as fine, Kirby returns with a new Caretaker record, this one the soundtrack to a film by director Grant Gee about the German writer W.G. Sebald. According to Kirby, this material was actually recorded before Bliss, and Patience (After Sebald) is clearly the product of a similar process, though the record's overall mood is quite different. Instead of haunted jazz-age ballroom numbers, Patience draws from the music of Austrian composer Franz Schubert, sampling and manipulating (in some cases, very heavily) 78 recordings of his piece Winterreise. From its title on down, the Schubert piece brings to mind a frozen world, and Kirby responds in kind, crafting an album that hints at the season's chill with characteristic complexity and ambiguity. Given the nature of its source, Patience is mostly built from manipulated samples of piano and voice. ""When the Dog Days Were Drawing to an End"" loops a single keyboard fragment from a waltz-time section and punctuates the end of each cycle with a barely perceptible voice, and lets the melody, saturated with noise, spin in place for nearly five minutes. ""The Homesickness That Was Corroding Her Soul"" uses a warbly piano interlude for its repeated refrain, with the instability of the pitch imparting a sense of unease and tension. On the opener ""Everything Is on the Point of Decline"", hiss and rumble is pushed way out in front, so you can just barely make out the music beneath a blinding sheet of distortion. These are simple motifs, but they show an uncanny sense of balance and feel anything but accidental. But the album grows more interesting in its second half, as the processing gradually overtakes the source material and transformation becomes the prevailing theme. ""In the Deep and Dark Hours of the Night"" coats the piano line in a thick syrup of slap-back echo and layers it under a piercing layer of hiss, making the music feel simultaneously distant and close, like it's either coming from inside your head or is so far away you can barely make it out. ""No One Knows What Shadowy Memories Haunt Them to This Day"" and the closing ""Now the Night is Over and the Dawn Is About to Break"" takes the guttural male vocals from Schubert's piece and stretches them out, turning single syllables into tense, uneasy drones. The effect, oddly, will remind some of the Justin Bieber slowdown from a while back, which sounded like Sigur Rós being pulled through a black hole's event horizon. Kirby's voices, heard late in the record after the unsettling beauty of the piano loops, reinforce the feeling of collapsing into something, the howls, that could stand in for pain or ecstasy, suggest that something will never be the same. The brilliant thing about the Caretaker project is how it mashes together emotional states into something complex that can sound different each time you hear it. While the surface hiss and 78-groove crackle, which are sometimes so loud they overwhelm the music the grooves carry inside them, bring to mind decay and death. The immersive, womb-like nature of Kirby's approach also conjures childhood and a life stretched in front of you, filled with possibility. So this music, so basic on one level, is both warm and cold, blackened by mortality and twinkling with life, somehow evoking the wonder and absurdity of existence itself.","Leyland Kirby follows last year's An Empty Bliss Beyond This World with the soundtrack to a film about German writer W.G.

Habits & Contradictions,Schoolboy Q,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32a5e6ef959693223f2/1:1/w_160/5e85cf9d.jpeg,2012-01-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16216-schoolboy-q-habits-contradictions/,Top Dawg,"Schoolboy Q is the most promising foot soldier in Kendrick Lamar's Black Hippy crew, a small circle of talented rappers currently reinventing West Coast hip-hop, but he's more than that. His second full-length statement, Habits & Contradictions, is a sumptuously produced and deeply enjoyable hour-plus slab of weed-clouded rap, but it's more than that. I've spent the past four days immersed in it, trying to resolve its conflicting impulses and ferret out all of its weird corners, and the only thing I can say for certain is that, while listening to it, I feel pulled completely into someone else's center of gravity, which is maybe the most gratifying listener's sensation there is. The record's first layer is sheer sound: Habits & Contradictions is full of plush, inviting, high-thread-count production, the kind that pulls you toward fat headphones and a chair. Like Kendrick Lamar's Section.80, there is a woozy drag to the drums and a thick, clotted feel to the sounds surrounding them. It shares a metabolic rate with Houston screw music, but the album's chilly mood is closer to the heron'-gray-skies gloom of RZA and Mobb Deep. In fact, when Mobb Deep affiliate the Alchemist shows up halfway through Habits on ""My Homie"", he feels right at home. Habits & Contradictions is, accordingly, a dark and moody listen, but it never bogs down in momentum or succumbs to despair. ""There He Go"" flips a sample of Portland trio Menomena's brittle ""Wet and Rusting"" into a hard-hitting anthem. ""Druggys Wit Hoes Again"", with its gabbling bursts of vocal samples and bone-jarring snare kicks, is a prime slab of Bay Area gangsta music. Even when everything slows to a crawl, there are small sounds tucked in everywhere, enlivening the darkness: the spaghetti-western guitar twangs on ""Sacrilegious"", or the heavy-breathing Portishead drum break of ""Raymond 1969"". It helps that Schoolboy is an odd, genuinely unpredictable presence who sometimes seems to be rapping entirely for his own amusement. There's audible dryness in his voice as he drunkenly croons the off-key hook, ""House fulla money/ Tub fulla bitches,"" on ""How We Feeling"", and you can hear he's holding the words in air quotes, as if he's just trying the words on, since they're the Sorts of Things One Says in Rap Songs. On ""Nightmare on Fig St."", he teases the opening ""Ball so hard"" bars of ""Niggas in Paris"" for no obvious reason, and then launches into sharply worded threats (""The landlord, turn your lieutenant into a tenant""), head-turning non sequiturs (""We drive to pussy more than we do to church/ No AC but the heater WOOOORK!"") and a riot of demented ad-libs. This lily-pad hopping means that it takes a while for the buried emotion in Habits to surface. Schoolboy raps in a wearily flat voice that evokes Prodigy's, and his lyrics deal with all the dark stuff of gangsta rap: poverty, violence, drugs, hopelessness. But his music has none of gangsta rap's implacable, survival-at-all-costs forward motion. Schoolboy's music is dank with the lousy weather of disappointment, with human-sized failures. When he tells us about selling oxycontin with a lifelong friend who sold him out, he doesn't sound like murderous Vengeance Incarnate; he just sounds hurt. His tangled past as a set leader of the Hoover Crips, meanwhile, leaks out in small bits. ""Contradictions in my thoughts, and I just execute my feelings,"" he mutters on ""2 Raw"", and it hints effectively at an unspoken well of remorse. Schoolboy Q has little of Black Hippy alpha Kendrick Lamar's gloomy-paladin aura, or his rap-Hamlet charisma. But it's worth noting that, at least right now, Schoolboy is making stronger music than Kendrick. Habits & Contradictions sounds comfortable in its skin, at home its own quiet strangeness, in a way that Section.80 never manages. It's better-paced. He's probably not going to be a break-out star, but it's hard to imagine that there will be many more original or satisfying rap long-players this year.","Schoolboy Q is the most promising foot soldier in Kendrick Lamar's Black Hippy crew, a small circle of talented rappers currently reinventing West Coast hip-hop.

"Sparrowmania: Wit, Wisdom and Soul From the King of Calypso 1962-1974",Mighty Sparrow,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cab1335d7bf169a4b6/1:1/w_160/e02aafab.jpeg,2012-01-26 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16142-mighty-sparrow-sparrowmania/,Strut,"Trinidadian calypso, like 1980s rap, is the sound of current events masquerading as dance music. Or, put another way, it's a style that uses the social space of the dancefloor to deliver news and opinion. Great calypso singers exploit the same idea your kindergarten teacher did: That lessons are more happily-- and subliminally-- learned when set to rhythm and song. No singer has had a longer career in calypso and soca than Mighty Sparrow. He was born in 1935, won his first major prizes in 1956, and still tours. His best anthologies are considered starting points for anyone exploring the genre-- a project I accept is probably off the radar for a lot of listeners, especially in North America, where ""calypso"" has the unfortunate reputation as that stuff they play in the background of ads for all-inclusive vacation packages. The music supporting calypso singers is catchy and formulaic, and like all catchy, formulaic music, it requires craft and discipline-- a calypso band is only as good as its ability to subtly vary its tunes without upstaging its singer. The music, affable and upbeat as it may be, is backlighting for its singer. Sparrow's personality is big, complex, and contradictory. He plays the fool for two verses only to prove his wisdom in the third. He boasts and judges. He unwittingly insults himself with a huge grin on his face. On ""Jean and Dinah"", for example, he celebrates the departure of American soldiers because it'll give him a better chance to score a hooker. Politics and sex are treated with the same irreverence-- both, after all, are just stages for human folly. Sparrow songs offer a perfect kind of satisfaction, the kind viewers get from the neat circles of sitcoms and folktales. At the end, everyone-- often including Sparrow himself-- ends up out on their asses. His sense of humor is particular to the marginalized and disenfranchised. The past 500 years of Trinidad's history is a history of occupation-- first by the Spanish from Columbus' time until the end of the 18th century, when it was surrendered to the British, and used as a naval hub by the United States during World War II. Sparrow's songs hint at imperialism and national identity, but in the lighthearted way of someone who ultimately can't do anything about them. Laughter, in essence, is the source of Sparrow's intelligence but also of his self-preservation. On ""Don't Go, Joe"", for example-- which can be found on the compilation Volume One-- Sparrow sings about an American soldier who seduces his sister, Millie and then runs back to his wife and kids, but not before Millie pickpockets him. In a surprising line, he witnesses the soldiers crying in port. This shakes his expectations of them-- for a second, they're humanized. The song is at its core a comedy, but one shot through with the heartache of watching the imperialists have their way. Unfortunately, neither ""Jean and Dinah"" nor ""Don't Go Joe"" are on Sparrowmania!. None of his best songs are, really. The collection's cover has a nice, vintage feel, the kind that says we're a comprehensive reissue label that cares about quality and selection, and while Strut has released some high-quality compilations, this isn't one of them. Ultimately, it's just another collection in a pile of Sparrow collections divided between incisive, entertaining tracks, five-minute double-entendres about boners, and one-off experiments cherrypicked from a long and inconsistent career. Also, the sound is curiously awful, as if the music were mastered from a cranked-up transistor radio. Ah! how it pains me to type that. People deserve a two-disc Sparrow comp to bury all other Sparrow comps, but this isn't it (Smithsonian's First Flight, from 2005, is much better, though it falls off before Sparrow hit his prime). It's all sad and fitting, in a way: Music from a former colony gets marginalized by imperialist countries, haphazardly packaged, and easily ignored. Hopefully, it's the kind of joke Sparrow can take.","No singer has had a longer career in calypso and soca than Mighty Sparrow, and people deserve a two-disc Sparrow compilation to bury all other Sparrow compilations.

America Give Up,Howler,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b323b1335d7bf169a546/1:1/w_160/5e82ad52.jpeg,2012-01-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16212-howler-america-give-up/,Rough Trade,"It may upset folks rooting for Howler that they continuously get compared to the Strokes, but it's not like the band doesn't deserve it. After all, these affable Minnesotans offer the sort of spry and strummy ""no bullshit"" rock music that made tons of folks spring for the more expensive and less tastefully covered version of Is This It more than 10 years ago. That Howler's transformation from local faves to darlings of the international music press was aided by favorable write-ups in both The New York Times and the NME, as well as the breathless, semi-mythic pursuit of Rough Trade Records-- the storied UK label reportedly flew overseas to sign the band based on its unsolicited demo-- only help strengthen the spiritual bond between these two groups. It also helps (or hurts) that Howler frontman Jordan Gatesmith often offers his thoughts about love and loneliness in the same sort of laconic faux-macho groan that Julian Casablancas should've trademarked. But while Gatesmith, at the ripe age of 19, isn't much younger than Casablancas was when the ink dried on the Strokes' first contract, he's not nearly as comfortable striking the same disaffected poses. If anything, Howler suffer the more Gatesmith resembles Casablancas, partially because he's not pitching the same kind of game. Howler's hearts are firmly affixed on their sleeves, right below a magic-marker version of the Weezer ""flying W."" When Gatesmith's yawp collides with Howler's more sensitive sentiments-- for example, his shirt-rending complaints about necking on ""Wailing (Making Out)""-- it's not a good look. Howler are better off when Gatesmith veers towards flattering another New York City music icon, Joey Ramone (as on ""This One's Different""), or simply making sure that he doesn't get too excited. At this point in their ridiculously young career, though, Howler's best look is when Gatesmith isn't on the mic. As mentioned, Howler have got a little Strokes in their music as well, though any semblance of post-punk cool's been swapped out for some truly old-time rock'n'roll vibes. Gatesmith might still be playing catch up with the Rolling Stones (according to this interview with the MinnPost), but the group's deployment of Chuck Berry-esque licks and various Spectorian flourishes (including yet another ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat nod) shows they at least have a cursory knowledge of the classics. They also have a way with dynamics; I wouldn't be surprised if the two-tiered guitar assault essayed on the chorus of ""Beach Sluts"" was the result of someone wanting to approximate what the 11 on the volume knob would sound like. Why the album kicks off with ""Beach Sluts"" and not a standout track like ""Back of Your Neck"", though, is beyond me. The latter's affable charm (corny Bonnie & Clyde shout-out notwithstanding) is a much better first foot forward. But that track finds itself on the album's back end, grouped with the hazy (possibly shoegazey) ""Free Drunk"" and carefree, surf-friendly ""Black Lagoon"", all of them highlights. Instead, the album follows up a somewhat bracing introductory note with an assortment of OK to not-so-OK tunes that ultimately congeal into an undifferentiated, if intermittently enjoyable, lump, before ending on a high note. In other words, America Give Up is inconsistent and derivative yet promising, and not nearly as impressive as some early adopters would have people believe: a pretty typical rock group's first album. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.","These buzzed-about young Minnesotans offer spry and strummy rock music that leads to plenty of Strokes comparisons.

Hospitality,Hospitality,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b325ea9e61561daa6a3f/1:1/w_160/e8e613af.jpeg,2012-01-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16213-hospitality/,MergeFire,"Amber Papini's world is full of doors, locks, and keys. Half the tracks on her band Hospitality's self-titled debut LP make mention of these things, either their presence or, more significantly, their absence. Take ""Liberal Arts"", an appropriately languid tribute to mapless post-graduate ennui: ""So you found the lock/ But not the key that college brings/ And all the trouble of your B.A. in English literature/ Instead of law, or something more practical,"" Papini wryly surmises over a tamped-down electric riff and shuffly drums, showing her hand as the most promising recent graduate of the Tracyanne Campbell school of cardigan rock. (In non-metaphorical reality, Papini studied at Yale.) Then there's the dreamy, rootless ""Sleepover"": ""Lock the door, I'll take your coat/ Let's pretend that it's summer,"" she implores some itinerant lover, though the demand quickly slides into ""let's pretend that we're married"" and then, after a niggling guitar worms through the backdrop of brushy drums and gauzy harmonies, perhaps unsurprisingly dissolves: ""Lock the door before you leave."" This album is about the comings and goings that can consume a certain kind of twentysomething's life, about fuguing and settling and sometimes not being able to tell one from the other. This album is also very fun, perhaps because, as Papini has wandered into her 30s, she seems to have realized that none of that really goes away, it just gets easier, or at least starts to seem bearably silly. In these songs, quietly groovy drumbeats turn fully danceable in the flick of an instant, shimmering Afropoppy guitar rains down like confetti, whole brass sections seem to barge in and sneak away and climb back in through some window. The NYC-based trio recorded the album almost a year ago, then shopped it around and signed with Merge last fall. Some of the tracks (Papini wrote all of them; she plays piano and guitar, too) were re-recorded from their sparse 2008 EP, produced by Karl Blau, which was also called Hospitality. The LP was produced by the band's guitarist/drummer/keyboardist Nathan Michel (he and Papini are married) and Shane Stoneback, who's had his hand in the honeypots of Vampire Weekend, Sleigh Bells, and Cults. The not-new songs here don't sound reworked so much as run through some kind of cartoony scrubbing contraption, Wonka Wash-style, emerging stunningly clean out the other end, the curvy surfaces all gleaming in the sun. ""Betty Wang"", apparently a tribute to one of Papini's old day-job colleagues, has been especially improved. The original sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom under the lingering threat of whinging roommates, with frumpy drums and Papini fighting back a yawn; now there's a brash, almost bratty energy, Papini hamming it up on the rollercoasting, ""If you leave New York/ I don't care, I don't care!"" line in particular, teased by real live electric guitars, trotting drums, twinkling keyboards. What's lost is Papini's raw vulnerability and delicate guitar-work (""Half an Apple"", one of the EP tracks not carried over here, built around her meandering vocals and spare finger-picking, has more than a bit of a Laura Marling vibe). Papini's voice is funny-- kind of a knowingly prim brogue, one that would seem painfully affected if it wasn't so clear she's in on the vamping. As the press-packet story goes, she taught herself to sing growing up in Kansas City, Mo., via repeated listenings of the Psychedelic Furs' Talk Talk Talk. But that doesn't quite explain the darling strangeness of her voice, its sweet, rubbery petulance. It sounds more like she's channeling Hayley Mills duetting with Hayley Mills on ""Let's Get Together"", that song from The Parent Trap, the 1961 Disney movie in which Mills stars as teenage twins, separated at birth but reunited at summer camp, trying to trick their divorced parents into getting remarried. This preposterous plan at one point involves a musical number, the British Mills singing on one side as a West Coast tomboy, struggling to make sense of all the r's, and on the other as a clipped Boston debutante with a Mid-Atlantic lilt. Papini's voice falls somewhere in the funny middle space between the sisters' harmonies, whatever Midwestern drawl she might be shoving aside yearning from the wings, hand in hand with Mills' Londoner tendencies; she even punctuates a few of her own lines with a prodding ""yeah, yeah!"" that almost precisely echos the entirely unsubtle ""Let's Get Together"" refrain. All Mills got out of the song was a No. 8 Billboard hit and a politely-ignored novelty LP. By all accounts, Hospitality should fare a bit better.","Piloted by multi-instrumentalist vocalist/songwriter Amber Papini, Brooklyn trio Hospitality's self-titled debut LP blends intelligent lyricism with shimmering, often surprising production.

Nehru Jackets / The Palm Wine Drinkard,HeemsKool A.D.,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31413d197565213a8a6/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-26 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16199-heems-nehru-jackets-kool-ad-the-palm-wine-drinkard/,Greedhead,"Last November, Das Racist-- the quick-witted rap trio responsible for two of recent memory's most irreverent and engaging mixtapes and one divisive full-length-- made their national TV debut on ""Conan"", performing lead single ""Michael Jackson"" from their 2011 album proper, Relax. The scene was set for all the makings of great agit-prop theater: two stone-faced women smacking the living shit out of crash cymbals, crazed instrument swapping, and not to mention an actual Michael Jackson impersonator showing up to bust some time-honored moves during the noisy coda. It was like Andy Kaufman had he been raised on Illmatic and cable TV: Das Racist's secret strength is that you're never quite sure whether they're laughing with you or at you, but when they are at their best, their wise-ass approach also feels inclusive. The ""Conan"" appearance, however, was anything but welcoming. Heems (Himanshu Suri) and Kool A.D. (Victor Vasquez) mumbled through their verses, leaving the sloppy music to do the heavy lifting. Which made some sense, considering the record they were promoting was built to polarize. The paranoid Relax felt like a warning shot, a suggestion that maybe we'd all gotten a bit too close. And now we have two of three promised mixtapes from the DR camp, Heems' Nehru Jackets and Kool A.D.'s The Palm Wine Drinkard (hype-man extraordinaire Dapwell's bid is up next.) While both lack the accessibility that marked the first two Das Racist tapes, they allow the rappers to indulge their most far-out ideas. Heems and Kool A.D. sound like they don't care what anyone thinks, and the accompanying freedom brings back some of that early charm. Though the approaches are notably different-- with Nehru Jackets sticking closer to the Das Racist script and Palm Wine Drinkard spending most of its time in the deep end-- the tapes are filled with unexpected payoffs. If there was any question as to whether Kool A.D. was the true freak of the group, the first few minuts of The Palm Wine Drinkard lay it to rest. The opening track-- featuring the full seven minutes of Outkast's ""Spottieottiedopaliscious"" instrumental, junked up with what sounds like the din of a busy high school woodshop laid over top-- is annoying and offputting, but things get better. It could have skated by on the easy charms of stuff like ""Lagrimas Blancas"" (a funky chest-beater that finds A.D. cooling out by the pool in Barcelona, with an appropriate new mantra to match: ""Bitch, I'm James Murphy""), or the ass-shakingly friendly remixes of DR's ""You Can Sell Anything"" and ""Booty in the Air"". But when A.D. really stretches himself, some of the most bizarre ideas turn into something interesting. Most notable are the three post-Drake R&B tracks, presented free of smugness or irony: The cottony, seductive ""Ganglion of Lightnings""-- a 2008 track from A.D.'s Wesleyan group Boy Crisis, repurposed here-- is both sincere and intimate, conjuring a fluid dreaminess that feels sincere. Even when it fails, The Palm Wine Drinkard still entertains. Heems' Nehru Jackets is a nice counterpoint Palm Wine's experimentation. It's a no-fuss, traditional mixtape full of solid features (Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire) and some terrific production, all credited to Heems' childhood friend Mike Finito. ""We definitely listened to a lot of Company Flow and Def Jux stuff in high school,"" Heems told MTV Hive this month of the pair's affinity for the currently defunct New York indie rap label. It shows-- Finito's production is both enigmatic and hard-edged (plus, there's his dead-on El-P imitation on ""Mike Finito Raps Too""), full of junky drums, idiosyncratic sampling, and plenty of Punjabi influences. Followers of Das Racist (or Heems' Twitter feed, for that matter) know that racial and socio-economic topics are always close at hand, but Nehru Jackets is not an overtly political record. Of the tape's 25 tracks, only a few dig into the specifics of any given issue. ""NYC Cops"", which first showed up on a Stereogum's Strokes cover tribute compilation, is borderline harrowing, a vitriol-spitting rundown of the NYPD's checkered past, with the too-short, self-explanatory ""Juveniles Detained at Guantanamo Bay"" striking a similar chord. But Nehru Jackets as a whole is pretty loose, filled with free-associative raps that find Heems in various states of alertness, sobriety, and engagement. It's also way too long. As he explained in the same Hive interview, putting Mike Finito on was one of the primary goals here: ""I figured the only way for people to hear [his talent] is if I hop on these joints and give my man some shine."" Finito's work is one of the tape's strengths, but it also leaves Heems with a lot of ground to cover, and much of the material ends up feeling unfocused. In this setting, Heems is at his best when surrounded by better rappers, when he's able to mirror their enthusiasm and energy. If these two mixtapes prove anything, it's that these guys need each other.","Heems and Kool A.D. deliver two of three promised mixtapes from the Das Racist camp. While both lack the accessibility that marked the first two Das Racist tapes, they allow the rappers to indulge their most far-out ideas.

A Throne Without a King,PyramidsHorseback,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3219d034d5c69bf4c8a/1:1/w_160/bfb9042d.jpeg,2012-01-26 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16210-a-throne-without-a-king/,Hydra Head,"If you thought Pyramids' rapid-fire style-hopping, from trad doom metal crunch to post-rock's technical ecstasy, was exhausting on their 2008 debut album, then prepare yourself for an almost hour-long collage that makes their old stuff seem downright uniform. If you enjoyed the gnarled oomph of Horseback's take on bottom-heavy black metal, then get ready to hear that heaviness reduced to the merest eerie echo floating through that collage. Yet while their solo releases could frustrate via skill-without-conviction, or feel like retreads of well-worn metal sounds, these two bands seem newly invigorated by working together, and the collaborative A Throne Without a King takes a real chance, risks real failure, and goes further out than either group has on its own. While so much avant metal fails to truly scramble the genre's rules, often offering little more than weakened takes on metal's essentials, Pyramids and Horseback have jointed forces here to create a stylistic mutant. A Throne Without a King will probably repulse the folks out there sporting Repulsion tattoos. It will also probably puzzle those who prefer their black and/or doom metal with a comforting glaze of My Bloody Valentine-style melody. That's a shame, but it's hardly surprising. True, there are few moments of hardcore riffage and burning-at-the-stake screams. And there are moments of swirling beauty that could have easily been lifted off a shoegaze (or even early IDM) record. But rather than simply smushing two sorta-complementary genres together, Throne explores extremes of abrasive and soft, oblique structure and seeming formlessness, rather than simply recycling elements from the-genre-known-as-extreme-music. A long-form collage of feedback and fractured electronics, where the wary won't be asking ""is this metal?"" so much as ""what is this?"" If that kind of exploratory amorphousness, with a side of blackened ugliness, sounds appealing, you probably already know if you need this. In one of our rapidly disappearing brick-and-mortar record stores, the sticker might read: ""Recommended if you like dark ambient, old-school academic tape edits, horror movie sound design, the fringes of improv electronics scene, etc."" Though the main attraction is clearly the album's titular four-part epic, which sprawls for close to an hour, Throne opens with two relatively short and palate-readying tracks, a solo outing from each band. Ostensibly this will allow new listeners to get some idea of the particular aesthetic universes Pyramids and Horseback usually inhabit, before the rest of Throne obliterates those reference points entirely. Pyramids' contribution sounds like recent Mego in a mellow mood, alternating brief hair-raising moments of dissonance with placid electronics. Horseback title their piece in honor of left-field composer Henry Flynt, and you can (very) vaguely hear Flynt's influence in the way this tribute to Norway's corpse-painted heroes collapses midway through into pure drone, only to rebuild itself for one final assault. ""A Throne Without a King"" parts one through four, however, sounds not much like either of those modes, except for maybe tiny traces sprinkled through its vast and unruly whole. As with so many longform experimental compositions, boredom lurks when things get too loose. Part three aims at some kind of icky Ferrari/Dockstader musique concrète, all ominous clangs and rattling iron, but goes on way too long, sapping the drama until it all starts to sound like some goth kids aimlessly futzing around in dad's toolshed. Much better are the moments when Throne goes majestic rather than minimalist. Part two pits angelic choirs against disruptive blasts of static; part four subjects glacial atmosphere à la Wolfgang Voigt to what sounds like several corrupted mp3s' worth of digital distortion. It's here Pyramids and Horseback evoke certain metal qualities, the grandeur and the gloom, the brutality and fearlessness, without needing to actually draw on metal's vocabulary. If they'd managed that across the whole piece, ""A Throne Without a King"" might be a minor masterpiece of modern, unsettling sound manipulation. As it is, while it's impossible to claim that every minute of Throne will grip you, even if you’re already attuned to this sort of untethered drift, it's a strong, spooky soundtrack for these early frostbitten months of the year.","This spooky collaborative LP between avant-metal acts Pyramids and Horseback takes a real chance, risks real failure, and goes further out than either group has on its own.

Pop Ambient 2012,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3199d034d5c69bf4c7f/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-25 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16203-pop-ambient-2012/,Kompakt,"What's left to say about the Pop Ambient series? That it appears every winter? Check. That it has become a bit of a chore? Done. That shifts in its tone and content are subtle? Been there. That it rarely breaks artists of note? Got it. It has become difficult to tease differences out of the series as its chapters have grown voluminous, and I'll submit that the real question we need to ask about the Pop Ambient series is not what remains unsaid but what the series itself has left to say. Pop Ambient 2012 arrives at a time when ambient and experimental artists routinely sing for their supper, offering theoretical frameworks and positioning their works as commentaries on music, media, and memory. The goals of the PA series and its artists are largely sonic, bridging the gaps, however tenuously, between electronic music, modern classical, and pop. The series' flower motif suggests a kinship with Erik Satie's concept of furniture music, or music explicitly intended for the background. Gorgeous soundtracking is a fair, modest goal of ambient composers, but music of this ilk-- from Leyland Kirby (and his Caretaker alias) to Emeralds to Oneohtrix Point Never-- has felt so vibrant and rich in recent years that the offerings here seem slight. Stop me if you've heard this one before: PA12 contains another new Wolfgang Voigt side project (Mohn, with Jörg Burger), a Kompakt techno stalwart making his first-ever series contribution (Superpitcher), and notable outsiders (Simon Scott). Intrigued? Which volume of the series did you pull off the shelf to listen to in anticipation of these revelations? Forgive the cynicism. The failure of PA12 has little to do with the individual tracks, most of which could, at worst, be harmlessly swapped out for the third-most-forgettable offering on any given PA compilation. There are highlights, as always: the beautiful simplicity of the piano that steers Superpitcher's ""Jackson""; Wolfgang Voigt's ruptured, surprising orchestrations on ""Rückverzauberung 5"". Five years after lighting up PA07 with the Field's ""Kappsta"", Axel Wilner debuts his new guise, Loops of Your Heart, whose ""Riding the Bikes"" closes PA12 with lacy, somnambulent guitar. (In other words, the only new standout on PA12 is the alias of an artist who has already released three full-lengths for Kompakt.) There are more obvious missteps than in previous years, though. On ""Richmodis"", Triola masses clanging minor chords into a long, useless noir. Mohn's comp-opening offering, ""Manifesto"", is not just slow and ringing but comically ponderous. Magazine's self-edit of ""The Visitors Bureau"" is pro-forma symphonic drift. Just as Now That's What I Call Music 40 hardly suggests permanence, PA12 is damned by its place in a series that grew stale several years ago. This is not even the best ambient compilation Wolfgang Voigt has appeared on in the past year: Kompakt regulars Andrew Thomas and bvdub (who makes an appearance here) compiled Air Texture Vol. 1, a frothy, generous collection that outmaneuvers PA12 at every turn. Ambient music feels rich and diverse right now, willing to engage with wider worlds. The expanses of PA12's tracks belie how cloistered and small the compilation actually is.

Wilson Semiconductors,The Howling Hex,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b312ea9e61561daa6a24/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16200-wilson-semiconductors/,Drag City,"For someone who has spent the bulk of his musical life sourcing inspiration from the past, Neil Hagerty hasn't made many backward movements through his own career. When Pussy Galore reformed for one of Yo La Tengo's annual Hanukkah shows this past December, he was nowhere to be seen. The Royal Trux reissues Drag City's put out barely seem different from the original releases. And any thoughts of him getting back together with former Trux partner Jennifer Herrema seem more remote than ever, especially as she just delivered her best album in years under her new Black Bananas guise. Despite apparently living by a never-look-back creed, there are usually a few signifiers in each new record by the Howling Hex-- a strained, phlegm-ridden growl, a stack of stodgy riffs-- that make everything he does suitably Hagerty-esque. Even the title Wilson Semiconductors feels like an obscure nod back to the inert object fetishization of ""Ray O Vac"" from Thank You. This is an EP of four long songs that continues the drum-less setup on the 2008 Howling Hex record Earth Junk, with a simple guitar/bass/vocal set up getting the job done. It's ragged and detached, with dips into tight song structure followed by long, meandering guitar passages that feel like you're tied up in a loose strand of thought circling Hagerty's brain. He's lived out in the desert in New Mexico for some time now, and it's not hard to hear that influence at work here, especially on the ranchero flavor of the waltz-time closer ""A Game of Dice"". Except, this being Hagerty, it's sci-fi ranchero, full of squelching, thickset guitar parts, joined by a reedy vocal line that makes it sound like it was recorded when he needed to pee real hard. It probably was. So, in many ways, this is an extension of the work he began on Earth Junk, albeit with a few divots to negotiate along the way. On the opening ""Reception"", Hagerty works up a bouncy guitar undertow over which his vocal finger wagging warns up-and-comers about the perils of entering the music game. It's got the kind of authoritative cadence that his best work always has, where you feel like you're suddenly privy to a nugget of invaluable information, no matter how silly it looks on the page. In that sense Hagerty works in a great rock'n'roll tradition, where delivery begets meaning. The intent derived from the whiney, doubled-up vocal line, ""Reception, it can take a long time,"" can be parsed in a million different ways. But the way Hagerty conveys it-- swamping the mix, dripping with resonance-- leaves you in little doubt that some kind of indeterminate wisdom is being imparted by a tyrannical autocrat, and it's time to simply shut up and take notice. But, as with most material the Howling Hex have produced, Wilson Semiconductors easily passes from that kind of despotic strut to something more freeform. ""Brunette Roulette"" is an extended guitar exercise, shorn of vocals, edging close to the nine-minute mark with no particular place to go. It draws elements of freak folk into the mix, with a frantically strummed acoustic guitar loop underpinning strident soloing followed by a honeyed coating of flange two-thirds of the way through. ""Play This When You Feel Low"" is an unfocussed bridging of both worlds, with wild avant soloing conjoined to heavily reverbed vocals that struggle to find a place to sit comfortably. Each track here encounters a similar problem at some point. There are plenty of impulses worthy of exploration, but too often they end up tarnished by a listless desire to meander without direction, making Wilson Semiconductors feel more like a stopgap than a valuable addition to Hagerty's canon.","This ragged, four-song EP from the uncompromising Royal Trux songwriter/guitarist Neil Hagerty continues the drum-less setup of the Howling Hex's 2008 LP, Earth Junk.

File Under Sacred Music: Early Singles 1978-1981,The Cramps,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31813d197565213a8ad/1:1/w_160/cover.jpg,2012-01-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16202-the-cramps-file-under-sacred-music-early-singles-1978-1981/,Munster,"The Cramps were record collectors before they were a band. When Erick Purkhiser and Kristy Wallace met in 1972, they discovered they were both into the same kind of thing: the music of 15 years or so earlier that had been all about kitsch and shock and sleaze, with shitty sonics and snarling, hiccuping singers, and hilarious over-the-top bravado. In the early 1970s, being into ""50s rock'n'roll"" meant American Graffiti and Sha Na Na and ""Happy Days"". Wallace and Purkhiser preferred the nasty also-rans-- the records that actually tried to be the threat to society that people sometimes pretended pop music could be. It wasn't much of a leap to starting their own band in the same mode. Purkhiser reinvented himself as Lux Interior, the slavering, writhing, nearly naked, ectomorphic frontman of the Cramps, and Wallace was Poison Ivy Rorschach, a ""bad girl"" in leather and wigs and velvet who tore off one ichor-dripping 12-bar guitar riff after another. They didn't have a whole lot in common with their early punk scenemates other than big guitar noise, but punk rock gave them license to do sleazy, shocking, sopping wet rock'n'roll without having to bother with the usual thin veneer of respectability. The Cramps were an institution for over 30 years, until Lux's death in 2009. They were one of the few punk-era bands who were well served by aging, since they were trying to come off like creepy, depraved old people in the first place. But they were always a better singles band than an album band, and a way better live act than a singles band. Most of the songs that made their reputation are collected on this suitably trashy set. The vinyl version of File Under Sacred Music is, appropriately, a ""collectible"" box of the band's first 10 singles in replica sleeves--or rather, it would be except that four of them were never actually issued as singles at the time. (The Cramps always did snicker at anything that claimed to be authentic.) That's probably the ideal way to hear this material: Lux, Ivy, and their ever-rotating associates made the kind of strong, silly records that are best in hot-sauce doses of between three and six minutes. They occasionally came up with fabulously personal-space-invading originals like ""Human Fly"" and ""New Kind of Kick"", the latter of which features two lines that explain their raison d'être: ""Life is short/ Filled with stuff"" and ""I learned all I know by the age of nine."" The better part of File Under Sacred Music, though, is the crate-digging covers that were their calling card. Their first single (produced, like a lot of their early material, by Alex Chilton) was a cover of one of the most familiar trash-rock staples, ""Surfin' Bird"", extended to five minutes with a sloppy gnarl of guitar and drum noise. They subsequently shied away from anything that familiar. Instead, they turned their attention to obscurities whose quirks they exaggerated to the point of perversion. Jack Scott's ""The Way I Walk"" was slowed down to a psychotic limp, with Lux hyperventilating every line and Ivy screaming bloody murder in the background; Ronnie Cook & the Gaylads' nutty novelty ""Goo Goo Muck"" turned into a hilariously lascivious threat on which Lux shrieked, trilled, gurgled, and enunciated the title like it referred to whatever bodily fluids your parents feared most. The title of File Under Sacred Music is a joke about the dusty record stores the Cramps loved, as well as about their own discography: Songs the Lord Taught Us was the title of their first album, Songs the Cramps Taught Us the name of one of the many series of bootlegs of the original songs they covered. But the amazing, out-of-control music they saved from oblivion could show them up, at least on record. To hear the Novas' feral pro-wrestling novelty ""The Crusher"" (""Do the hammerlock, ya turkeynecks!"") next to the Cramps' cover is to understand the difference between lunatics who've somehow ended up with a mic in front of them and record collectors doing a solid, deliberate impression of lunatics.","Most of the songs that made the Cramps' reputation are collected on this suitably trashy box set of the band's early singles and other tracks from between 1978 and 1981.

Concealer EP,Jacques Greene,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31d5e6ef959693223d9/1:1/w_160/cover.jpg,2012-01-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16207-concealer-ep/,Vase,"Young Montreal producer Jacques Greene is very good at one thing: extracting a vocal snippet from some all-but-forgotten R&B star of the recent past (Ashanti, Brandy, Ciara) and then proceeding to build a shiny and modern combination of house and two-step underneath it. His best tracks thus far are like graduate-level versions of Billboard busters David Guetta and Calvin Harris' shame-free fist pumpers; they're subtle and spacey, but Greene leaves in enough kick and hook to keep everything floor-friendly. In his world, voices are repeating ghosts caught between the beat. And, depending on the time of day, they can sound euphoric or a little lonely. Just look at the video for his track ""Tell Me"". There are two tipsy models heading back to their very expensive, very solitary hotel rooms after what we can only assume is a night of $28 Midori sours-- it's not a hangover clip as much as a still-sorta-buzzed-at-6-a.m. clip. Jacques Greene makes music for models to stumble back to their suites to. Nothing wrong with that. Last year had him perfecting this formula across two excellent LuckyMe EPs, The Look and Another Girl, when he wasn't convincingly turning Thom Yorke into a proper diva and filling the geek-chic quota in pal Azealia Banks' ""212"" video. But Concealer, the inaugural release on his new Vase imprint, changes things up. The two A sides find Greene indulging his R&B tendencies more than ever before, with opener ""Flatline"" even featuring original vocals from fellow Montrealer Ango. But the track doesn't sound like a savvy spin on radio also-rans as much as a wannabe also-ran itself; the ironically flat lead vocal comes off like sub-par Drake karaoke while the skittering instrumental recalls Timbaland in latter-day ""Apologize"" mode. Clearly, it's one thing to gush about R&B heavies like The-Dream and Drake in interviews and cannily slip them into DJ mixes-- both of which Greene has done-- but quite another to successfully emulate them. Much better is ""These Days"", where the 21-year-old once again squeezes the most out of a well-chosen sample-- Mario's 2004 album cut ""Couldn't Say No""-- while also moving forward, switching out standard kicks for bottom-crawling tom hits. On the flip side are two more traditional two-step tracks, ""Clark"" and ""Arrow"", both unfortunately not quite living up to the lofty rep Greene has quickly earned. Whereas The Look and ""Another Girl"" displayed a tidy sense of dynamics and a just-right ear for attention-getting sonic finery, these two simply glide by on their own blandly classy ambiance. For someone who has nailed that exquisite limbo between foreground and background, Greene lets ""Clark"" and ""Arrow"" drift away too easily. To reiterate: Jacques Greene is very good at one thing. That one thing is unique and not easy to pull off. And there are still undiscovered corners for this producer to take his sample-based club sound before he jumps into the realm of more traditional song structures and vocals (which probably shouldn't be thought of as a be-all, end-all anyhow) or extended instrumentals, à la the nine-minute ""Arrow"". So Concealer has all the marks of a transitional release, a feeler. While constant reinvention is a nice ideal, it's not for everyone.","The inaugural release on the young Montreal producer Jacques Greene's new Vase imprint changes up the sample-based club formula he perfected on two excellent 2011 EPs.

MU.ZZ.LE,Gonjasufi,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30f13d197565213a89a/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16197-gonjasufi-muzzle/,Warp,"Gonjasufi's 2010 release *A Sufi and a Killer *succeeded largely on the strength of an engagingly odd presence: the simultaneously croaky and sweet voice of Sumach Valentine, which sent initiates scrambling to identify fellow travelers, from Captain Beefheart to George Clinton to John Fahey. It stood up as a strong example of psychedelic rock rewired for an audience more attuned to *Madvillainy *than The Madcap Laughs. But it still scanned a bit more like a shared vision than an individual voice: The album was just as much a revelation for the Gaslamp Killer, who helmed the bulk of the production and laid down his own mark with a sprawling slate of beats that complemented Valentine's vocalizations. When the album that introduces a unique vocalist to a newly expanded fanbase also happens to do the same for its equally distinct producer, you wonder how each will fare on his own. If last year's freebie *9th Inning *EP was a catch-up session of self-created, unreleased older tracks meant to remind newer fans of his broader repertoire, MU.ZZ.LE scans like a means to transition from A Sufi and a Killer's multiple-identity psych into more personal territory. And it does this in a way that reinforces what made that previous album great. Gonjasufi and fellow San Diegan noise-break purveyor Psychopop have centered their production around a codeine-paced, heavy-headed swoon that still manages to bristle with an undercurrent of stress. Psychopop handles beats for four of the 10 cuts, and their half-speed wooziness is like the musical equivalent of the slow-motion running you might experience in an unsettling dream. The headswimming electric piano blues of ""White Picket Fence"" and the loping, pendulous guitar in ""Feedin' Birds"" set the pace, ethereal as it is, and get a surprising amount of pull from their downtempo floatiness. But Gonjasufi's own production is just as steeped in dubbed-out, crumbly atmospherics. The bass in ""Venom"" glows and throbs, peppered with a jingling percussion timbre halfway between a tambourine and a handful of change. ""Blaksuit"" sounds like a vintage funk 45 flipped to 33, its twangy loop pacing back and forth like a half-finished thought. And even when the snares pop, as they do on ""Nikels and Dimes"", they do so through a thick coating of resin and ash. If you think that means MU.ZZ.LE is a passive, inert slog of an album, keep in mind that every trudging, straining step of the way is cut through with Gonjasufi's voice, which is still a hell of a thing. The unconventional cast of his voice might be Valentine's most immediately recognizable trait, but it's not his deepest. Every last creaking wail, blown-out mutter, and wounded drone is heavy with reflection, and after a few listens it all starts to sound less like altered-mind eccentricity and more like raw, unfiltered feeling. For all the talk about shroomed-out weirdness and otherworldly mysticism that's surrounded his music, there's a more crucial sense of a real, laid-bare emotional core here. All those shaky notes and half-intelligible murmurs disintegrating into decaying echoes might run parallel to an oddball Lee ""Scratch"" Perry sensibility, but they evoke frustration and dejection vividly. The words aren't always clear through the fog of reverb, though this might be by design, some statement on how the plain truth of honest words can be sometimes hard to understand. But the agitated sentiments remain clear, whether castigating against the abuse of privilege in ""Nikels and Dimes"" or straining to maintain an interpersonal connection on ""Rubberband"". When Sumach's wife April has a wraithlike torch-singer turn in the second half of ""Feedin' Birds"" and distantly doubles up his lead on ""Skin"", it's to act as a sweetly voiced counterpart to lyrics that allude to guilt, death, and a search for love. And when the funereal lo-fi new wave of ""The Blame"" emerges near the end of the 24 1/2-minute running length, it's the late peak of a record that wrings out a devastated man's crisis of consciousness-- ""You say I'm not supposed to kill/ Keep walking with my head high/ But every time I go somewhere/ I feel the dread inside their eyes."" MU.ZZ.LE might be a transitional point on Gonjasufi's path and it shows just one face of an eclectic, multifaceted performer. But it's also that rare album that feels meditative and cathartic all at once.","This 10-song EP scans like a means for the San Diego vocalist to transition into more personal territory. It's the rare album that feels meditative and cathartic all at once.

Amaranthine,Richard Youngs,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31bc0084474cd0c2086/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16206-amaranthine/,MIE,"You could say that no two LPs by venerated-yet-underrated Scottish avant-rock artist Richard Youngs sound alike, and in the main you'd be right. How can you sum up a musician who's appeared on dozens and dozens of records over the last 20 years, rivaling Sun Ra and Merzbow in their similarly fecund and all-over-the-map output? Of course, even someone who contains multitudes occasionally repeats himself, and there are obvious sonic links from one Youngs release to the next. For one thing, his keening voice remains as instantly recognizable on the new Amaranthine as ever, as does his idiosyncratic-unto-inscrutable phrasing, where excessively drawn-out lines trade off with obsessively repeated lyrical fragments. But even still, you'd be hard-pressed to draw a direct line between Youngs' previous two albums and the haunted murk of Amaranthine, even as it focuses on (and amplifies) many of his central obsessions. For example, his longstanding interest in pushing rule-bound forms like folk and rock and devotional music into the rule-free space of improvisation, or stretching their inherent repetitive natures past the accepted limits. These two modes are taken to a visceral extreme on Amaranthine. Rock is smelted down into a pervasive drone-roar that suggests the music's power while abandoning almost all of its familiar structural elements. Meanwhile, the steady state of that drone is counter-pointed by wild junkyard percussion that denies the very existence of the backbeat. The howl of ecstatic jazz is stripped of any blues or swing until just the yearning for total movement in any direction remains. Youngs' singing veers between liturgical formality and an expressionist bleat that mimics Albert Ayler's horn at its most mournful. It's a long and wooly journey into a rather forbidding place. Intriguing, at times overwhelming, and voyeuristic like a peek into a private ceremony. But still forbidding. On a casual listen, Amaranthine sounds loose and repetitious in a way that suggests the players shut their minds off and got down to some primal state of in-the-moment music making. The obvious suggestion is that you should do the same as a listener, letting the emotion of the sound wash over you. And sure, that's one way to approach it. Amaranthine certainly has the feel of a tribal incantation playing out in real time, of a group losing itself in the unconscious flow, captured in the kind of fuzzed-out fidelity that more recalls a field recording of a wayward cult than an academically precise studio session. The elements that make up Amaranthine are drawn from various strains of free music at their most direct and primal. It's an ""experimental"" album that hits you first on a gut level. Youngs on Amaranthine can sound shamanistic or mind-erasing or beyond words, any of the terms we usually apply to immersive and free-flowing music that seems out to bypass the intellect for chills up the spine and tingling of the arm hairs. But the one word you'd never use to describe Youngs, however emotionally expressionistic he can get, is ""primitive."" As usual, a scrupulous intelligence lurks behind Amaranthine's seemingly off-the-dome journey into innerspace. For instance, only an assured musician would attempt the dichotomous mixture Youngs pulls off here, two approaches that might seem at first to be at odds with each other: the mantra-like repetition of drone and the anything-goes invention of free music. Though his music can often have a homemade feeling-- if nothing yet quite as ""séance in the barn"" as Amaranthine-- Youngs is someone who's thought out each aesthetic left-turn as carefully as any arts-grant-endowed composer. He never simply shakes things up for the hell of it, and the new terrain he stakes out almost always turns out to lie within his strengths, however dissimilar it seems from his previous projects on first blush. But even still, it makes sense that Amaranthine is super-limited-edition. His more recent albums-- the skewed pop of 2010's Beyond the V**alley of the Ultra Hits and the fractured folk minimalism of 2011's Amplifying Host-- may have been (relatively) more user-friendly. But Amaranthine is among the spookiest and least-tethered sets Youngs has released in years, not quite for-fans-only but definitely for those who wanna go way out.","You'd be hard-pressed to draw a direct line between Scottish avant-rock artist Richard Youngs' previous two albums and the haunted murk of this new limited-edition LP, even as it focuses on and amplifies many of his central obsessions.

The Lion's Roar,First Aid Kit,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b315ea9e61561daa6a2a/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-24 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16205-the-lions-roar/,Wichita,"First Aid Kit is two sisters, Swedish, last name Söderberg. Klara is younger and shorter, the one with the dark bangs cut right across her heavy eyes, who sings with a crooked underbite that she could probably never set straight without wrecking the lovely specificity of her voice, the slight lisp of it, her languid vowels. Johanna, the older one, about whom everything is long (her limbs, her blondish mane), mostly sings harmony; her voice is darker and heavier and comes from somewhere different from her sister's. Klara seems to coax hers out from just under her tongue, while Johanna, her eyes growing wide and distant whenever she has some bars to herself, often appears to be channeling something far beyond her body, beyond the room, beyond even the sky. Last year, First Aid Kit went to Omaha make their second album, The Lion's Roar, with Mike Mogis, a producer and also a member of Bright Eyes, perhaps the first band that Klara loved. Their debut, 2010's The Big Black and the Blue, released when the sisters were just 17 and 19, was so striking-- with their otherworldly, interlocking voices and uncanny understanding of imagined adult pains-- that the tracks' demo-grade quality was easily overlooked. This time, though, they have all of Mogis' bells and whistles at their disposal: his way of almost imperceptibly coaxing a song into full bloom, his feel for when to gussy-up and when to strip away, but also, yes, actual bells and whistles, or at least one deeply eerie flute tone that lingers throughout, floating in and out of scenes like a sly specter. And a new clutch of friends appears for the closing track, ""King of the World"", a song so jumpy and earnest and ecstatically terrified by the unknowable future that Conor Oberst seems to have had no choice but to consummate the clear homage to the best of his mid-2000s output by making an appearance himself, along with the Felice Brothers, whose showing as a wheezy, rattletrap backing band nearly redeems their dismal 2011 album, Celebration Florida. For the sisters' part, their voices are steadier now, and richer, as if they were told enough times how good they are that they're finally resigned to believing it. (It's a shame, then, that Mogis can get a bit heavy-handed with the reverb-- their nakedly mic'd voices are almost always more stunning.) The choruses are big and chewy, even on the most melancholy tracks-- ""Blue"" is perhaps one of the more charming songs ever involving the phrase ""now you're just a shell of your former youth"" and would be even without the twinkly glockenspiel and bumpy little bassline. Thanks to Mogis, The Lion's Roar would sound like a very good album even if it wasn’t one-- but likewise would be stunning even if the band had been left to its own devices. And yes, that's very likely ""Blue"" as a Joni Mitchell allusion, though the rambling, scatter-pitched confession of ""New Year's Eve"" may be more of a direct tribute. First Aid Kit have this guileless way of making their influences clear, as if offering up the source code of their art to the world, not as proof of anything but in a spirit of communion-- perhaps most specifically making the offering to girls just a few years behind them, sitting under the grip of some pair of huge headphones in their childhood bedrooms, hearing the Söderberg sisters' words and voices for the first time, feeling something shift inside them, wondering where this beautiful thing came from, and finding clues there even before they know it. ""Emmylou"", maybe the best song on the album, and its second single, does this most deftly and most directly. ""I'll be your Emmylou, and I'll be your June/ If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny, too,"" the chorus blurts over bashful drums and wry pedal steel, the sisters shaking out the one-syllable names with giddy relish. Do you know any other song involving young women trying to romance would-be beaus with sweet sweet voices and Americana trivia? ""I'm not asking much of you/ Just sing, little darlin', sing with me,"" the chorus continues, but if all they really wanna do is croon a few numbers, I'll eat my Nudie suit. Klara and Johanna say they wrote the song before they'd set foot in America. As if to make up for lost time, last year, when they finally came over to the States, they went to California, out to Joshua Tree. It was the birthday of Gram Parsons, who would have been 65 if he hadn't died there when he was 26. They made the music video for ""Emmylou"" there, wearing caftans and drifting side by side through the scrubby desert like characters in a psychedelic Aaron Sorkin drama. They burn incense at a cross made of colored stones, an ad hoc tribute to the more official ad hoc tribute kept up for Parsons there at the park; they wave the smoke with their small hands; they throw out their arms and let their sleeves flutter out in the wind. I wonder what they thought about when they were out there-- if they felt new, if they felt homesick, if they were somehow disappointed, despite everything, to not see Gram himself wandering over the hills. I wonder if they thought about how they will most likely outlive him, how one day they will have been making music longer than he was even alive, how one day they will outgrow their caftans and their crosses, how the most beautiful songs they're ever going to write are still waiting for them out there in the future somewhere.","The Swedish sisters Klara and Johanna Söderberg's sophomore album was recorded in Omaha with Bright Eyes' Mike Mogis and features guest spots from Conor Oberst and the Felice Brothers.

Resolution,Lamb of God,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b310ea9e61561daa6a22/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-24 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16198-resolution/,Epic,"If you heard Resolution before knowing anything about the band who made it, you'd be forgiven for mistaking Lamb of God's latest as the high-production, major-label debut of an energetic, upstart crew. At 14 songs and 57 minutes, Resolution feels like the sort of unedited, exhaustively long collection a label might get behind to see if at least one of the songs lands with a wide audience. Such signs are everywhere on Resolution: Each of the choruses in these rigid Pantera-cum-Slayer recasts are aggressively emphasized, with thickets of backing vocals and rhythms and structures that slow or shift so as to beg you to swallow the hook. Lyrically, Lamb of God certainly write like a young band of heshers out for an angry good time-- Metallica quotes, subverted clichés, and diary-entry misanthropy laced with high-school vocabulary words and winking glimpses of profanity, drugs, and religion. And though the band is not only at its best but its most comfortable with four-minute formulaic tracks-- burst open, barrel ahead, shift at the bridge, regain momentum, and implode at the exit-- they take care to show that, even if young, they're versatile, too, the sort of band that boasts the promise of a varied future. There's the convincingly sludgy opener, the ghostly acoustic moments that serve as intros and interludes, and the creepy spoken-word surge of a closer. And it's all captured with big, bright production by Josh Wilbur, a major-label stable member who has worked with everyone from Steve Earle and Faith Hill to Pink and Limp Bizkit. But Resolution is Lamb of God's seventh album and their fourth for Epic Records, making them one of the few current American metal bands to sign with and stay on a major label. They've done well there, too, peaking with a chart position of No. 2 for their most recent record, 2009's Wrath, which earned two Grammy nominations and sold a few hundred thousand copies. Those past stats and the Virginia band's status as relative metal statesmen for the mainstream make Resolution that much more disappointing in context. Despite the handful of hooks that do stick and those big ""risks,"" like the acoustic blues strums at the start of single ""Ghost Walking"" or the belligerent boogie that opens the much better ""Invictus"", Lamb of God's general lack of adventurousness makes them mostly indistinguishable from their heroes and, budget excepted, the bulk of their contemporaries. After a decade of becoming arguably the biggest American metal band that either didn't exist when George H. W. Bush was president or didn't come from a cartoon, you would hope that Lamb of God had earned the right to be adventurous, to try and stretch their legacy wider than that of a band subservient to its predecessors. Resolution simply sounds like a refinement of their past, with their unquestionable technical prowess (especially impressive is the occasional interplay between guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler and drummer Chris Adler) funneled again into songs that would lose any distinction in a mixtape of their peers. On ""Invictus"", this record's most structurally and lyrically compelling track, Randy Blythe roars the album's least instant but most interesting hook: ""You brand it a crisis/ I name it an honor/ To face what arises/ To remain unconquered."" That ethos reappears throughout Resolution, an album that, despite all this talk of bravery, lacks the resolve to sound anything but normal and predictable. With so much history and more than a million album sold, you'd think sounding mistakably young would be a compliment. But on Resolution, it doesn't equal a band bursting forth with ideas or burning with ambition; it means that, apart from the number of records they've sold, Lamb of God still need to find a way to make an impression last longer than an album cycle.","The seventh album from one of America's few major-label metal acts feels like the unedited, overly long collection of a younger band trying to make its mark.

Aside from his vague association with Tesfaye and company, there's not much to be found about the mysterious producer. He's let a few of his own productions trickle out over the past few months, and collected them in a free-to-download mixtape called Furthur, a short collection of instrumentals that handily profiles an intriguing new name in an increasingly overcrowded set of knuckle-dragging, mopey hip-hop beatsmiths. Well, to call it hip-hop wouldn't exactly be accurate: in a fashion similar to Balam Acab and Holy Other's, the slow swing and drowsy drop that DropxLife favors is a whole lot more trip-hop than hip-hop. We're talking real trip-hop here: There are moments on Furthur that sound uncannily like mid-1990s Bristol-- Portishead, Massive, Tricky-- updated for 2012, and the ones that don't tend to lean on other arbiters of downtempo like DJ Shadow, maybe even Thievery Corporation. Not to be relegated to copycat or crate-digger, however, what makes DropxLife feel less like a retro fetishist is the distinctly digital nature of his work: Loaded with filters, effects, and heavily-processed sounds, Furthur has more in common with cloud-rap than the scratchy vinyl samples of early trip-hop. What the trip-hop dimension does for Furthur is to lend it a relaxed, almost carefree vibe: Like a tranquilized RZA, this is unfiltered spliff music with a vaguely orientalist bent, almost too languorous to even imagine someone spitting over it without getting tangled up in the long washes of sound or angled lashes of string instruments. Take opener ""MadexMen"", centering around some filtered coos and a strummed guitar, with slow, glitchy drums that sound like they're sliding off each other: This is remarkably lazy stuff, taking the codeine crawl of Clams Casino and like-minded acts to a new plateau of dazed and blazed. Clams Casino is an essential reference point here: The raspy breezes and gauzy gasps that coat tracks such as ""BexForever"" feel torn right from his page. There are differences of course-- the sub-bass in ""BexForever"" feels far more brutal than anything I've heard by Clams, and a lot of Drop's beats heave and lurch with a wide-arced pendulum swing. But it's still hard not to hear him in the bits of tabla and other light percussive touches that scuff the surface of ""StillxShots"" in a way uncannily similar to the New Jersey producer's ""Numb"". Taken on their own terms, DropxLife's tracks are more physical, cleaner, composed of disparate elements; if Clams seems to mould and bend songs out of monolithic shapes, DropxLife builds them piece-by-piece from the ground up, but you probably wouldn't think twice about uttering them in the same breath anyway. It's this lack of personality that makes Furthur a merely pleasant listen rather than a truly stimulating one. Furthur's best moments come when DropxLife goes nuts with the delay effects, creating a dazzlingly shimmering surface that skips and skates over the low end to disorienting effect, like walking the wrong way down a moving conveyor belt (the motion-sickness phasing on ""1stxFlr"" or the dry heave guitar on ""TripXEnt""). But we shouldn't forget who people are rightly going to associate DropxLife with, and highlight ""RedxBloor"" indeed sounds like a chopped-and-screwed Weeknd track, featuring a heart-wrenching vocal sample not unlike the disembodied female voices that pop up on Weeknd tracks ""Lonely Star"" and ""Next"". Even just that snippet of a vocal endows DropxLife's sluggish torpor with a vivacity the rest of it lacks, a liveliness he's going to need to develop if he wants to be anything more than another bloodshot bedroom beatmaker.","The Toronto-based DropxLife was partly responsible for ""Initiation"", one of the highlights of the Weeknd's Echoes of Silence.

Clear Heart Full Eyes,Craig Finn,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b317b1335d7bf169a536/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16201-clear-heart-full-eyes/,Vagrant,"""Good ol' Freddie Mercury is the only guy that advises me,"" Craig Finn sings on ""No Future"", from his first solo album, Clear Heart Full Eyes. Later in the same song, he calls out another 1970s rock icon: ""The best advice I've ever gotten was from good ol' Johnny Rotten,"" he confesses, before launching into a few lines from ""God Save the Queen"". As rock touchstones go, Queen and the Sex Pistols aren't too far off the beaten path; he could have quoted Alex Chilton or Damo Suzuki or even Elvis Costello, but that would miss the point. Finn is after the artists and music that try to make rock a communal rather than a private experience. So he's an unlikely hero for the cloistered and segmented indie rock crowd, which we're told prizes obscurity over accessibility. Ironically for a band whose lyrics depicted geographically specific subsubcultures, Finn's day-job group the Hold Steady brought a bar-band approach back into the indie rock world. They strove for broad appeal, which circa 2005's Separation Sunday sharpened their guitar attack and made them sound almost dangerous. Over time, however, that same populism softened the Hold Steady's edges and blunted their urgency, and Finn's solo album, whose title is cribbed and scrambled from ""Friday Night Lights"", may be the culmination of that particular trajectory. If most solo albums at least make an effort to distinguish themselves from the artist's main outlet-- to justify their very existence-- Finn's chief tactic on these songs is to play everything close to the chest, to dial the music back and the intensity down. That's fine for songs such as ""Western Pier"" and closer ""Not Much Left of Us"", but deadly for ""When No One's Watching"" and ""Honolulu Blues"", which sound like he's consciously trying to avoid sounding like his main band. The guitars rarely venture toward riff or melody; instead, they provide atmosphere and mood. But so much of Clear Heart Full Eyes cries out for louder guitars, Springsteen-like drama, and the kind of precise sloppiness the Hold Steady did so well in the late 2000s. The album works best when it sounds freshest and furthest away from the music we typically associate with Finn. ""Terrified Eyes"" shuffles around on a laidback beat and a rangy, almost alt-country guitar, as he takes the conspiratorial tone of a tour guide pointing out the sites of crimes and scandals. ""New Friend Jesus"" rambles acoustically, although Finn makes the title character sound like a punchline. That's odd considering how much of the album is given over to some of his most blatantly Catholic (or is that catholic?) lyrics. If Separation Sunday rewrote the rules and rituals of religion as street-level spirituality, Clear Heart Full Eyes mostly plays it straight. Like some of the best Hold Steady albums, these songs are all interconnected, full of recurring characters and settings, so that even when the tempos lag and the guitars noodle, Clear Heart is pulled along by pure narrative momentum, giving it an immersive power that it doesn't necessarily earn. But that's Finn's main appeal: He's a born storyteller who's chosen rock as his medium. On Clear Heart he creates a new world with unique characters and rules, which are concrete, specific, and evocative. While it pales alongside some of the Hold Steady's best albums, these songs are so entangled with those people and places-- with those Holly and Charlemagne mythologies-- that they never grow tedious or ignorable. So perhaps Finn is turning into someone like Mercury or Rotten, acting as adviser to a new generation of listeners. Like them, he came on like a man on a mission, but now that it's been accomplished, he sounds like a man trying to figure out what comes next. Clear Heart is just good enough to keep us listening.","Dialing the music back and the intensity down, the Hold Steady frontman's first solo album feels like the culmination of the softened edges and blunted urgency of his band's more recent trajectory.

Hubble Drums,Hubble,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b308c0084474cd0c2062/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16191-hubble/,Northern Spy,"Hubble is the guitar-centric solo project of N.Y. native Ben Greenberg, perhaps best known for his gymnastic fretwork in the avant-jazz collective Zs. Like that project, the 26-year-old multi-instrumentalist could be described as DIY Brooklyn's answer to 1970s Manhattan crossover composers like Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham, artists who merged the endless repetitions of minimalism with the amplitude and instrumentation of punk. Greenberg is a trained jazz guitarist who's been gigging around the city in rock bands of all stripes since he was in middle school. He was a founding member of the defunct New York art-punk trio Pygmy Shrews, and was recently recruited to play with local rock iconoclasts the Men, whose Leave Home LP he engineered. Hubble Drums finds Greenberg channeling his affinity for high-intensity marathon jams into an elemental formula: a guitar, a chain of delay pedals, and a handful of melodic progressions, most of them barely a second long. In the live setting, Hubble's music can feel like a collision between Robert Fripp guitar noodling and minimalist experiments in phasing. As he draws each melodic fragment out into a sprawling, 10-to-20-minute epic, Hubble also becomes the spectacle of Greenberg struggling against himself, pushing up against the limits of his own psychic and physical endurance. In the context of the contemporary synth revival, the result will hold particular appeal for fans of Emeralds, early Oneohtrix Point Never, Keith Fullerton Whitman, and other stargazing, kosmische-inspired musicians in the practice of mining the meditative potential of the endless arpeggiation. The difference between them being that Hubble's music is partly a showcase of Greenberg's technical virtuosity, the intensity of which makes it exausting for him to perform. Either through conscious manipulation or human error, Greenberg seems to exhaust every possible micro-variation of each of the phrases he attacks. The catch is that none of the the melodies ever resolve themselves, creating a state of suspension that can feel either like euphoria or anxiety, escapism or entrapment, without us even noticing the change. (Note that, though I wasn't involved in its selection, a track by Greenberg appears on a compilation I'm organizing with a friend.) Where Hubble Drums really inspires, however, is when Greenberg introduces a bit more textural play, cranking the distortion on 20-minute closer ""Glass Napkin"" just enough to evoke a scorched Grateful Dead jam or a slightly over-indulgent Hendrix solo. It's uncomfortable and pleasingly familiar at the same time, and it makes minimalism à la Terry Riley sound eerily compatible with what is probably the most maximalist rock-n-roll trick in the bag: shredding. Greenberg's recent collaboration with Tiffany Borders from the Space Telescope Science Institute and video artist Sheena Callage, which sets ""Hubble's Hubble"" to imaging of actual Hubble telescope data, gives a good visual metaphor for our listening experience, both here and elsewhere on this beautifully troubling debut: an endless back-and-forth between details and expanses, wide angles and extreme close-ups, anxiety and awe.","The conservatory-trained jazz guitarist and sound engineer Ben Greenberg (Zs, the Men) channels his affinity for high intensity marathon guitar jams on this beautifully troubling Hubble debut.

Vodka & Ayahuasca,Gangrene,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e85e6ef9596932238f/1:1/w_160/fb158ff0.jpg,2012-01-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16168-gangrene-vodka-ayahuasca/,Decon,"It might say something about the way things accelerate these days that it already feels like Gangrene have been around for ages. But tracing their lineage back through last year's Roc Marciano collaboration Greneberg and 2010's Gutter Water brings up a still-recent origin point in the Alchemist's 2009 all-star blowout, Chemical Warfare. The precedent for the collaboration between Alchemist and fellow producer-slash-MC Oh No was strongly established on cuts like ""Acts of Violence"" and ""Under Siege"", a couple of cartoonishly sinister tracks that pushed indie/street crossover rawness into a no-fucks-given irreverence about how raw it actually was. If you want a quick-and-dirty idea of what kind of flag they planted, take into account that their equivalent of a funny-wigs ""Sabotage"" video was footage of them doing violent slapstick spliced into newscast tapes of the Rodney King riots. So why does it feel like they've been around longer? Besides the fact that Alchemist and Oh No are veteran presences on their own-- the ""We Gonna Make It"" producer meets the ""Supermagic"" producer would be a fascinating-enough odd-couple pitch-- there's been a lot of conceptual forward momentum at work in their last two-and-a-half years. If Gutter Water dragged the grimier tendencies of underground hip-hop through a dysentery-infected toilet party and Greneberg was Marcberg's weirdly invigorating hangover, then Vodka & Ayahuasca is a stab at drunk-psych nightmarishness that runs on slasher-flick suspense. Throw in a bit of weirdo grossout comedy-- the intro track has one of the nastiest clips of someone puking I've ever heard on record-- and you've got a good indication of a couple of artists trying to outdo themselves in the outrageousness department. How much they succeed rests on how well these two fuse their production styles, and Alchemist's knack with stoner-friendly, vaguely arena-rockish loops, recently exhibited at its best on Curren$y's Covert Coup, slots in well with Oh No's affinity for age-caked lo-fi detritus of obscure origin. Dirty-sounding guitars slash through ""Gladiator Music"", ""Dark Shades"", and ""Drink Up"", and with their churning riffs draining the cathartic payoff out of their old acid-rock contexts, what's left is a scraping, growling squall. Pianos and synthesizers are dragged shuddering out from the basement and worked into nerve-twisting loops, giving ""Top Instructors"" and ""The Groove"" a forceful tension. Basslines and breaks stay heavy and crisp, even through the most weeded-out doom-tempo trudges, while ""Flame Throwers"" and ""Odds Cracked"" in particular have enough bounce in them to keep a front-to-back listen from getting bogged down in murk. That atmosphere helps hold up Vodka & Ayahuasca's sense of anarchic, altered-state unease when the lyrics don't quite cut it, though the tolerable-at-worst punchlines and metaphors are easier to stomach the less dead-serious you take them. Alchemist's badgering flow is self-assured and self-aware enough to give even his clunkiest lines an ""I meant to do that"" affability, turning his Marmaduke namedrops and organ-trafficking threats from corny to actually-kinda-funny. (It helps that when he's on, he's on, his paint-huffer odyssey on ""Auralac Bags"" in particular.) Oh No's technique is standard-issue Left Coast abstraction, prone to its share of attention-getting moments for internal-rhyme wonks, and when he takes the reins there's some tightly-wound phraseology to dissect. But the most memorable lines either come from guest spots-- Kool G Rap and Roc Marciano flat-out repossess ""Gladiator Music"" and ""Drink Up"" respectively-- or the found-sound clips about hallucinogen freakouts and belligerent arrestees that provide the most unhinged moments. No matter-- if Vodka & Ayahuasca is worth listening to, it's not an easy equation of lyrics versus beats. What's crucial is that it feels like an album-length distillation of that moment in a horror movie where the suddenness of a character's death is overtaken by how exaggeratedly gruesome the aftermath is.","West Coast rap producers/MCs Alchemist and Oh No's most recent collaborative effort-- featuring guest spots from Kool G Rap and Roc Marciano, among others-- is a stab at drunk-psych nightmarishness that runs on slasher-flick suspense.

The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy,Nada Surf,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3005e6ef959693223b0/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16187-nada-surf-the-stars-are-indifferent-to-astronomy/,BarsukCity Slang,"Nada Surf have managed a couple of feats in their two-decade-long career that might make any indie rock band envious: They broke out with a ubiquitous (if novelty) hit on MTV and alt-rock radio at a time when those were still the only channels by which to do so and, perhaps more importantly, they quietly outlived that popularity to score a second act as sweetly unassuming indie rock underdogs. On 2002's Barsuk release Let Go, Nada Surf re-emerged as the little brother to label-mates Death Cab For Cutie-- the sophomoric 1990s angst swapped out for more deliberate melodies and softer arrangements both timely, as that brand of indie rock was beginning to take over, and timeless. A decade later, soft-touch ""indie adult contemporary"" has become 2011's agreed-upon national wallpaper, and Nada Surf are attempting to make some noise. Noting that they've ""always played faster and a little harder live,"" frontman Matthew Caws and crew set out to capture the raw, excited feel of a practice-room jam session with seventh album The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy, the followup to the 2010's If I Had a Hi-Fi. They come out of the gate strong with the distorted guitar crunch and shimmying hi-hats of ""Clear Eye Clouded Mind"". The song's energizing pre-chorus almost sounds like Thermals-lite, with lines that start at the end of each measure and wrap around to the next, always landing on that initial ""I."" The album is upbeat throughout, especially by Nada Surf standards, with the rhythm section propelling several songs. But maybe ""recapture"" is a more precise word for the urge behind Astronomy's liveliness. Multiple songs dwell on feelings of disillusionment and lost youth. ""When I Was Young"" recounts the banal minutes of a day over willowy finger picking before the song swells and Caws wonders, ""When I was young... what was that world I was dreaming of?"" ""Let the Fight Do the Fighting"" cautions, ""You're gonna wish that you were young again/ You're gonna wish that it was fun/ You're gonna wanna have someone again."" Most troublesome, though, might be ""Teenage Dreams"", the nth iteration of that song title in recent memory, whose chorus, ""It's never too late for teenage dreams,"" comes dangerously close to the realm of ""30 Rock"" parody. These are larger existential longings than pining for another cross-over hit, of course, but they feed into an idea of the band as past its prime-- which is strange, since Nada Surf seem so comfortable coasting. Caws' voice is still light and feathery, the band members are all nimble enough musicians, and songs such as ""Waiting for Something"" touch the same dull sweet spot that's secretly tickled by, say, the Gin Blossoms' radio hits. But for all its adeptness of craft and attempts at revitalization, The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy still feels like an album with precious little at stake. The songs are fine but largely feckless, and what could be an animating contrast between glum lyrics and upbeat music is too often hobbled by clunkers both generic (""I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep"") and specific (something about tarot cards). At a moment when indie rock could probably use a little kick in the ass, Nada Surf seem to have the right instincts, just maybe not the spleen to pull them off. Harder and faster isn't necessarily a young man's game, but it isn't really Nada Surf's either.","On their seventh album, Nada Surf set out to capture the raw, excited feel of a practice-room jam session.

DirteeTV.com,Dizzee Rascal,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b303b1335d7bf169a513/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-23 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16190-dirteetvcom/,self-released,"Dizzee Rascal finished out the first decade of the 21st century as a skirt-chasing, champagne-popping celebrity with a taste in totally fun (but gaudy) dance-pop. Needless to say, this was not a turn of events that would've been easy to predict in 2003. Boy in Da Corner remains an astounding debut, but one with (in retrospect) very little in the way of crossover potential, at least on a ""chat shows and TV adverts"" scale. In the beginning, ""grime"" summed up Dizzee's sound quite well, a statement of aesthetic principles as much as an easy genre tag. The nasty, minimalist clang of the beats may have been startling, but it was no sane DJ's idea of party fuel. And Dizzee's intensity on the mic suggested a guy who might snap if this rap thing didn't pan out. But over the next seven years, it worked out better than anyone, especially Dizzee, probably could have guessed when he was just a teenage hellion with a voice like an alarm cutting through the static on London pirate radio. It would be easier to begrudge Dizzee his success if his later music, lightweight as it could get, wasn't so instantly and consistently pleasurable. Still, those of us who first came to love the teeth-baring, don't-give-a-fuck Dizzee couldn't help but hope he'd return to the stomp-and-snarl sound. Well, here you go. A mixtape available for the low asking price of your email address, DirteeTV.com is designed more as a showcase for Dizzee's label/crew Dirtee Stank than a chance for Rascal to flex on his lonesome. But when he hits the track, Dizzee's rapping with an all-or-nothing ferocity that makes Boy in Da Corner sound like the kid he was. And the beats are often take-no-prisoners massive in a way that invites comparisons to Lex Luger, at least if Lex were forced to rebuild his sound from the last 10 years of British bass culture. It was no surprise to read recently that Detroit rapper Danny Brown is a Dizzee fan. They both sometimes rock the same edge-of-hysteria flow, as if each time they pick up a mic might be their last chance and they're not at all happy about it. But they've also got a range, from imperious sneer to just-joking nasty boy, that elevates them above the guys forced to shout or mumble because they can't do anything else. Dizzee takes all tacks here, but he's at his best in the tape's early stretch, when even at his most frantic he seems utterly unfazed by the Brick Squad-grade mayhem of the beats. The first third of DirteeTV.com is some of the most thrilling music Dizzee's recorded in years, and part of the joy is in how tracks like ""Guts N' Glory"" and ""I Want It All"" match the apocalyptic density of the best current American street rap through a wholly UK set of sounds. Likewise he uses that old but still effective grime trick of taking a portentous bit of classical music and looping it to an extreme, heard best on the beastly ""Minimus"", where opera squall straight out of a horror movie meets dancehall drums pitched to a tempo better suited to moshing. But as with so many American mixtapes where the more famous rapper graciously but mistakenly cedes the spotlight to his squad, the guest stars occasionally threaten to drown out the main draw and drag the proceedings into pedestrian, just-another-mixtape territory. When Dizzee's magnetism disappears entirely, don't worry about feeling too much guilt over your urge to hit the skip the button. Special shout to D Double E, though, whose ability to maul a vowel remains unmatched on either side of the Atlantic. And while any MC will bring a much-needed dose of adrenaline to the cavernous murk of the tracks where grime and dubstep seem damn near interchangeable, things do get a little flat in the middle stretch, where that minimalism almost gives way to plain torpor. Thankfully things rebound in the final third, especially on ""Wavestation"", which rescues the noble tradition of the bass drop from Skrillex's cloddish peers, cooking up something more like an arcade game rewrite of Dead Prez's ""Hip-Hop"" b-line. Like most of its American cousins, DirteeTv.com is too long by at least six or seven tracks, and not always the ones where Dizzee steps aside for his vibe-sapping pals. Did he really need to recycle his own moldy oldies on ""Ain't Havin It""? And the quality control is too lax, especially during the middle stretch that teeters on the edge of grime-by-numbers, to plausibly call it any kind of instant classic. On the other hand, like those weekly U.S. transmissions from the DatPiff nation, it's also free, so you can't get too grouchy about having to prune the dull beats after downloading. And it's a chance to hear Dizzee rapping at fearsome full tilt, something we haven't gotten enough of since he started scoring multiple No. 1 hits at home. He attacks these no-crossover-bullshit beats with the aggression of a rapper who's still got something to prove, but with a confidence that comes only when you've already outperformed everyone's expectations, especially your own.","This free mixtape is designed as a showcase for Dizzee Rascal's label/crew Dirtee Stank, but it includes some of the most thrilling music the English rapper's recorded since his stomp-and-snarl days.

Attack on Memory,Cloud Nothings,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e2b1335d7bf169a4db/1:1/w_160/6d5f6176.jpeg,2012-01-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/,Carpark,"About a year ago, it seemed easy to predict what Dylan Baldi's first great album would probably sound like. After the release of the Turning On, a self-recorded collection of CD-Rs filled with tuneful alt-punk songs wrapped in tinfoil and steel wool that was released by the tiny California imprint Bridgetown Records, Cloud Nothings' self-titled debut on Carpark was an identifiable point on a familiar trajectory. The clarity afforded even by its modest budget made sweet and airy singles like ""Forget You All the Time"" and ""Should Have"" sound revelatory, while more overtly aggro tracks like ""Rock"" and ""Not Important"" felt thin and regressive, unnecessary vestiges of lo-fi provocation that didn't do Baldi many favors. And then ""No Future/No Past"" arrived as the first single from Attack on Memory. It was brightly produced but tonally dark with a queasy anti-melody-- a confrontational act that suggested that Baldi was going off script. Turns out ""No Future/No Past"" is the least representative track on Attack on Memory, but it opens the album with a necessary slate-clearing. While a full record of fizzy pop-punk would've been welcome, Cloud Nothings are trying for more. As an accidental concept album affirming the enduring power and purity of early emo (as defined by Dischord, Deep Elm, and especially Jade Tree), Attack on Memory feels above all necessary, a corrective for indie rock making allowances for everything except music that actually rocks. The overhaul is radical: It's literally a different band from the one that made Cloud Nothings. For one thing, Cloud Nothings is actually a band now rather than Baldi's solo project, retaining the lineup that toured with Fucked Up and likely learned a lot from them. While the freedom and ease of being a bedroom artist has its advantages, you can't make your own Sunny Day Real Estate and Wipers records without a beastly rhythm section. Even beyond the short window of time that passed between Cloud Nothings and Attack on Memory, this is a record that crackles with ""let's get this on tape now"" immediacy-- eight tracks, about half an hour, blunt lyrics, big choruses, lots of screaming. Fussing over these songs would've sapped their urgency. ""No Future/No Past"" is the first gauntlet Baldi throws down but it's not the most daunting. At more than nine minutes, ""Wasted Days"" is far longer than anything on Cloud Nothings. As a radio edit, it could be something like Cloud Nothings' answer to Foo Fighters' ""Everlong"", a fanged beauty of barbed chords, torrential drum rolls, and impassioned emoting. But as it rolls on, ""Wasted Days"" becomes simultaneously forbidding, disorienting, and psychedelic, something like a black-and-grey kaleidoscope. As the band hurtles to the finish, Baldi repeatedly yells, ""I thought! I would! Be more! Than this!"" in a high-voltage scree as a painful paradox after such an ambitious display of more. Baldi has always been a hooks guy*,* and Attack is every bit as catchy as the more rigid and user-friendly Cloud Nothings, and the spaciousness of Steve Albini's recording gives plenty of room for these hooks to careen into each other: ""Stay Useless"" is an anthemic tantrum that shifts rhythm without warning, the bludgeoning riffs of ""No Sentiment"" give way to the plaintive vocals and jittery snare runs on ""Our Plans"", while ""Cut You"" fades out the record on a gracefully arcing chant that's equally vengeful, self-loathing, and hopeful. There's the temptation to give too much of the credit to Albini, whose open-door policy has attracted an endless number of cred-deficient bands.  Attack on Memory is unmistakably his work-- Baldi's vocals are close-mic'd and raw, the drums are loud as hell, the guitars are economically panned and almost entirely free of effects processing, and there's actual space in between of all of them. But here's Baldi explaining Albini's role to Pitchfork's Jenn Pelly: ""Steve Albini played Scrabble on Facebook almost the entire time [we were recording]. I don't even know if he remembers what our album sounds like."" It was meant as a compliment, but the lesson is clear: A lot of producers would be better off stepping back and doing nothing. Attack on Memory isn't what typically gets classified as a ""headphones record,"" but that's the best way to first experience how alive it sounds, aggressively leaping out at you with real dynamics. Check the giddy explosions out of the pockets of silence punctuating ""Stay Useless"", the offbeat harmonies and rhythmic stumble that sound like happy accidents on ""Fall In"", or Baldi's serrated bark shredding the uneasy full-band détente following the solo of ""No Sentiment"". That's where you'll find Attack on Memory's key lyric, ""No nostalgia and no sentiment/ We're over it now and we were over it then,"" making the title's implications clear: If you enjoy this as a work of art, there's an invitation to adopt it as cultural critique. Baldi shares stages and a label with Toro Y Moi and joked about ""Forget You All the Time"" being ""our most chillwave song"" at a Los Angeles show, so the title is more of a call to be heard in the current climate rather than a total negation of it. But the last Fugazi album came out when Baldi was 10, and it's easy to see ""memory"" as a stand-in for indie's stylistic pervasiveness: de-emphasis of guitars and live performance, passivity over aggression, past over presence, singing like you don't care if you get understood or even heard. That just doesn't cut it for a lot of people his age who wonder if they'll ever witness ""The Argument""'s kind of life-affirming vitality firsthand. There's a fundamental irony in how a record titled Attack on Memory is such a sonic throwback, while Baldi's lyrics obsess over arrested development and missed opportunities.

Not when this sound's death was the wrongful diagnosis of trendwatchers: Those of us who grew up on Drive Like Jehu, Braid, and Jawbreaker can listen to Attack on Memory and sense their artistic legacy is in good hands, but there will inevitably be teenagers for whom Attack on Memory stands to be that kind of record to call their own.

Back on Time,Plug,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fcb1335d7bf169a50b/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16184-back-on-time/,Ninja Tune,"The vaults of electronic mischief spun from the fingertips of Cornish musician Luke Vibert are apparently well-stocked. Like his fellow West Country dweller Aphex Twin, Vibert appears to have a dearth of unreleased material yet to see the light of day. These days most musicians and music fans have some form of useless archive-- the simultaneous rise of the mp3 and computer-based sequencing software guaranteed that a surfeit of recorded music would lay dormant on hard drives across the globe. Back when Vibert was starting out, at some point in the early 1990s, he seems to have been a digital junk soothsayer, amassing a great body of work while the rest of us were tooling away on Prodigy message boards and getting to grips with AOL for DOS. Unlike the rest of ours, his binary debris actually seems to have some value. In 1995, Vibert released a series of EPs under the name Plug, which served as a catchall moniker to present his typically twisted take on drum'n'bass. An album, Drum 'n' Bass for Papa, followed a year later, around the time he was being courted by major labels. Trent Reznor's Nothing Records released Drum 'n' Bass for Papa in the U.S., handily packaging it with the prior EPs. As the popularity of the genre waned, Vibert wisely bailed on Plug, instead choosing one of his many other aliases to work under. But he couldn't shake what once seemed like a one-off fudging of popular genre tropes. In 2006, an EP titled Here It Comes emerged, comprising four unreleased Plug tracks. Now we've got another clearing of the vaults, this time in the shape of a full-length LP comprised of Plug recordings Vibert made from 1995-1998. The original Plug records skirted under the radar of most serious drum'n'bass heads. It lacked the pile-driving ferocity of most Metalheadz releases and/or the jazz-tinged seriousness of Good Looking's output. There were other shades of drum'n'bass, of course, but very few of them touched on humor, which remains a common touchstone for many of Vibert's projects. It's unlikely he was looking to hold down a residency at the Blue Note in pre-hip Hoxton (ironically, the same venue where his current label, Ninja Tune, hosted their legendary Stealth nights). Instead, he always seemed happiest working in his own sphere, which, for Plug, meant blurring the lines between the bloodless white-knuckle ride of drum'n'bass and the easy listening boom that was gathering pace around the mid 1990s. Back on Time is barely separable from Drum 'n' Bass for Papa; it's essentially more of the same. Vibert's breakbeats still writhe and skitter, methodically contorted around his eccentric choice of samples. On ""A Quick Plug for a New Slot"", a lumbering beat slugs lethargically into the mix before a pinging sitar line forces everything to lurch into a sprightlier clip. The excellently titled ""Come on My Skeleton"" feels like it's straining under the weight of its own excesses, with fat slabs of industrialized sound vying with twists of an opera singer climbing up into her higher range. The latter ends with Vibert pulling a rabbit out of the hat in the form of a straight-laced man claiming, ""you might also become aware of your anus or genitalia."" Even on this older material he's an expert at diffusing tension in that way, always ready with a banana peel to slip under the mix in case things are getting a little too serious. That pranksterish approach is the point where most people either get on or off board with Vibert. On Back on Time, it works to his advantage, largely thanks to his ability to balance out his humorous inclinations with an unnerving ability to sequence it all over an impressively brutal infrastructure. On ""Back on Time"" he's able to filter John Barry-esque string parts through indecipherable vocal bellowing and a beat that floods the mix with its tinny timbre. Even the relatively subdued ""Mind Bending"" ends up stacked high with junk, with Speak & Spell-style speech synthesis vying for space with jerky analog loops and a wild-eyed raver shouting, ""fucking excellent acid house."" That form of maximal japery foreshadows the work of Rustie and James Ferraro, partially explaining why this material sounds fresh again. It's a kitchen sink-like flood of sound, always on the verge of resembling a gigantic curveball being forced down your throat, but with Vibert pulling back from the humor brink at all the right moments.","In the 1990s, the Cornish electronic musician Luke Vibert offered a pranksterish take on drum & bass under the Plug moniker.

Praktica,Young L,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30cc0084474cd0c206a/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-20 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16195-praktica/,self-released,"It's funny now, knowing what we know about Lil B, to go back and watch the video for the Pack's 2006 track ""Vans"", which features a then-17-year-old Based God tentatively slurring a perfectly amateurish verse about the importance of wearing skate shoes. Lil B is not completely a different person now-- he's retained a good amount of the intense goofiness present in both ""Vans"" and its video-- but he's obviously mutated into a much different and more singular artist since his days with the Pack. The song's producer, Young L (he also raps the third verse), has also grown into his own since ""Vans"". But where Lil B's turned into a bizarre rap savant, L has stuck to the slaps of hyphy that were the song's backbone, gravitating toward construction and sounds that are less pop and more outwardly showy, with rapping that often sounds like it's merely cruising along for the ride. This has presented a bit of a problem at times for Young L, who, across various mixtapes in the past few years, has hit on some great tracks but generally had trouble matching the quality of his rapping to the quality of his producing. With Praktica, his most recent tape, he comes as close as ever to accomplishing that, and the result is a record that feels for the first time like he's found the formula for making consistently good solo songs. His rapping is still more about charisma, charm, and knowing how to ride his own beats than about lyrics, and the one song here that's tagged as a freestyle is indistinguishable from everything else on the tape. His rapping is both dumb and dumb, and it's a style that works for him here because there's a youthful brashness and confidence in his delivery, something that allows L to sell his rapping without coming off as trying too hard. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the beats are uniformly great. L's production has always been spare, heavy on keyboard beeps, and equally reliant on bass and open space. On Praktica he cannibalizes sounds from Mario and Pac-Man in a way that is inspired and novel instead of gimmicky. At a crucially digestible nine tracks, there is no overextension of the idea, and the sounds of classic video games are so harmonious with the production style Young L's cultivated that you wouldn't even bat an eye if the samples he pulls weren't so immediately identifiable. As befits an internet-savvy artist who had a hit song in his teens and also owns his own clothing line, L has always seemed filled to the brim with ideas, and the tricks he pulls on songs like ""Arcade Pussy"" and ""Super Nintendo"" are some of his best yet. There is still something very raw about Praktica, and L in general, that will turn some people off, and you almost have to be willing to approach his verses as if they're choruses-- where small phrases and snatches of melody will embed themselves in your head-- to fully appreciate his rapping. But there is something undeniably kinetic about this cocky, self-assured artist honing his sound and skill level that helps make up for much of the tape's shortcomings. There may be a disappointing 20-track tape on the way, but if L continues in this direction, we may bizarrely look back on ""Vans"" as the breeding ground for a few of the most distinctive young voices in West Coast hip-hop.","This nine-song mixtape finds the Pack's ""Vans"" producer coming close to matching the quality of his rapping to the quality of his producing.

Unemployed,Alog,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b304b1335d7bf169a516/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16193-unemployed/,Rune Grammofon,"This is the fourth Alog record I've reviewed here in the last seven years, and with each I have to assume that you're reading about them for the first time. Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide are electro-acoustic experimenters from Norway, and they've yet to step out from the dimly lit corners of the contemporary music avant-garde: They've never ""broken through,"" and at this point I doubt they ever will. Their music is not inaccessible, but it does play with the idea of what music itself can be, and they tend to avoid emotional manipulation. They present sound that is texturally rich and organized in an interesting way, but they're not telling you to feel happy or sad when you listen to it. All of which is to say that they are way down the list of abstract sound-makers likely to appeal to people who have a limited amount of space in their daily listening for abstract sound. This is understandable, but it's also a shame, because Alog make wonderful music that sounds only better with time. Unemployed, their most recent album for Rune Grammofon, is very much a continuation of the arc of their previous records, meaning that it doesn't really sound like any of them. Every Alog record-- and indeed every track-- carves out its own space, and Haugan and Eide seem either incapable of or uninterested in repeating themselves. But while they don't have an overriding sonic signature, they do have some broad qualities that drive their approach to music. Their music is whimsical, frightening, sentimental, and atmospheric, often at the same time. On this album, they use location-based instrumental recordings, found sound, field recordings made on tour, and mix it all with studio work that blends samples and live instruments. These elements and approaches are fused together in such a way that you never really know which sound came from where. The result is music that feels open and free, which, for me, serves as a welcome reminder of how much my typical response to music is informed by idiom. In general, there are two ideas that inform Alog's music. One the one hand you have playfulness. In the manner of, say, the Residents, Alog's music has a strong sense of ""Let's try this and see what happens."" Tracks like ""Apeland"", which seems to be a recording of a gorgeous organ of some kind, but mic'd in such a way that the action on the keys produces both warm drones and a percussive tapping, feels like the product of setting up some microphones in a room and having fun with sound. ""Baklandet"" seems like a folk song of some kind, sung by a high voice that could be female, but the acoustic instruments are tweaked and messed with slightly, giving the pretty tune a destabilizing warble. ""Et Besok"", a simple exercise in the emotional possibilities of vocal processing, takes a voice and does strange things to it, balling it up in effects and then spreading it back out so it assumes a new shape. When Alog aren't being playful, they're exploring the idea of music as ritual. In some cases, this comes out in their ear for layered and immersive drones that strike a balance between the electronic and the organic. Alog are good at making tracks that you can turn up and zone out to, tracks that feel like rooms to explore. And then sometimes they turn up the heat. The 17-minute ""Last Day at the Assembly Line"", which serves as the centerpiece of the record, is an exercise is tension and catharsis. It mixes caveman drum pounding, rapidly bowed strings that sound like gears grinding away in a machine, and, eventually, voices that chant and coo but favor sound over language. It's a terrifically powerful track that manages to evoke both stasis and decay, and it's continually either building up or falling apart. It definitely brings to mind krautrock, like a super-stripped-down version of the cultish mantras of Amon Düül's Psychedelic Underground, but pulling out a term like ""krautrock"" doesn't quite make sense. Alog get me thinking about what music is and how it works on an almost molecular level, so familiar ""sounds like"" references feel beside the point. Their music is enjoyable for how it gets me thinking in addition to how it makes me feel. It returns me to that state of hearing something new and alien for the first time and wanting to know more.","The Norwegian electro-acoustic duo seems either incapable of or uninterested in repeating itself. On this album, they use location-based instrumental recordings, found sound, and field recordings, mixing it with studio work that blends samples and live instruments.

SXLND EP,Machinedrum,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30ec0084474cd0c206c/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16196-sxlnd-ep/,LuckyMe,"For a producer who's been doing exciting things in bass music over the past year, Travis Stewart's musical origins are barely traceable to the genre. Never mind that the beginnings of his catalog as Machinedrum predate the genre's ongoing cultural flashpoint by a decade-- until his recent move to Berlin, the geographical space between him and the largely UK-based sound was vast. Ideologically, however, Stewart's attraction to bass music makes perfect sense. Over the past decade, he's subtly shifted from misty downtempo to Prefuse 73-reminiscent glitch-hop to the sort of Dilla-fied beat ooze that refuses to go out of style. His 2010 release with the Glasgow label LuckyMe was titled Many Faces, and the title seemed apt. As a solo artist, Stewart doesn't like to stay in one place long. As Andrew Gaerig put it in his review of Stewart's fantastic debut LP with fellow producer Praveen Sharma (aka Braille) as Sepalcure, ""bass producers tend to treat innovation like daily prayer."" At one time, it would have been difficult to call Stewart as an innovator, but then he released last year's Room(s) on the similarly hard-to-pin-down label Planet Mu. It was a heady, sensual trip through the smeared-vocal technique that most first encountered on Burial's 2007 breakthrough Untrue, incorporating the repetitive rhythmic kicks of footwork and coating it in atmosphere. The whole thing was an overwhelming swarm of sound, more in line with the maximalist trends in electronic music discussed in Simon Reynolds' recent ""Maximal Nation"" piece. Compared to the marbled elegance of Sepalcure, Room(s) is garish and cheeky, but you can't deny the album's utter audaciousness. Relative to his work last year, Stewart's new EP on LuckyMe, SXLND, is a minor effort. Stylistically, the five songs on SXLND lie somewhere between Stewart's work on Room(s) and Sepalcure, with slight variations-- the former's clipped strangulations are backed by a spare, funky gallop on the title track, while ""No Respect"" and closer ""DDD"" take the latter's smooth alleyway hymns out to the club, courtesy of a steady 4/4 thump. Instead of pushing things forward, he's making lateral moves. The most notable thing about SXLND is the fact that its title track's serves as the backbone for rapper Azealia Banks' latest single, ""NEEDSUMLUV"". Heard here without her contribution, it indeed sounds like a backing track. And that's the main issue with SXLND as a whole: There aren't enough standalong tracks, just a collection of tunes that would sound great stuck in the middle of a solid DJ set (see, for instance, Stewart's recent FADER mix, where the EP's material hit much harder than when isolated here). So this is one for committed fans, those who've been following along with Stewart's recent renaissance and trying to guess what his next move will be.","One half of the bass duo Sepalcure issues a five-song collection under his longtime Machinedrum moniker, including a title track that served as the backbone for Azealia Banks' latest single.

Something,Chairlift,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fbb1335d7bf169a509/1:1/w_160/99a53c43.jpeg,2012-01-20 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16183-something/,ColumbiaYoung Turks," Chairlift's second full-length, Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer Caroline Polachek has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and Polachek has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic relationships and the evolution of character. Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit ""Bruises"" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member Aaron Pfenning split with the group after his romantic relationship with Polachek ended. (He now has an atmospheric disco project called Rewards.) Now a duo, Polachek and multi-instrumentalist Patrick Wimberly have a different chemistry. Wimberly, a producer on several Das Racist tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits Polachek's voice and melodies. As a result, Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen. Polachek's presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that potential liability into a strength on two of Something's most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling wry lyrics without getting too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of Robert Smith-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in ""Sidewalk Safari"" or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", Polachek sounds totally comfortable and in control. Though it's obvious that Polachek is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to Something's success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on Something are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" Polachek still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus. The song on Something that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop. ","Chairlift's second full-length album is a major creative leap from their first, but it doesn't so much reinvent their sound as refine it.

Dimensional Rip 7: Thee Physical Remixes,Pictureplane,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b309b1335d7bf169a522/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16192-dimensional-rip-7-thee-physical-remixes/,self-released,"Travis Egedy's last Pictureplane album, Thee Physical, was a crowded concoction of garish rave signifiers, dance music clichés, and the punk-inspired free-for-all collage aesthetic of his earlier work weighted with lyrical conceits surrounding gender identity. With beefier production values that pointed more directly toward trance and euphoric house, it was undoubtedly the most complete and confident thing the Denver producer's created to date. But never a stranger to the internet, Egedy's free download series, Dimensional Rip, has played host to a handful of jumbled, messy mixes, and the seventh installment is a full-blown Thee Physical remix album. Well, sort of: It depends on how you define ""album."" Only five of Thee Physical's 11 originals are given the remix treatment, and they're plopped down as an unordered clump of beats. I'm not sure how we're supposed to listen to this; on my mp3 player, they're sorted alphabetically, meaning three remixes of ""Body Mod"" are followed by a whopping seven reworks of lead single ""Post Physical""-- it's not the most measured playlist I've ever heard. In my iTunes, however, the tracks are assorted seemingly randomly, splitting up the monotony but throwing in a whole lot of volatile randomness. So as much as we might want to call Dimensional Rip 7 an album, in practice it's merely a collection of tracks for us to peruse and choose from. Even though the production values of Thee Physical seemed to pull Egedy away from the kind of homemade dance music made from big obvious samples (such as 2009's memorable ""Goth Star""), its remix companion hands the album over to a whole spectrum of DIY denizens, from recognizable to obscure names. The results vary in quality just as much. For as many that simply aren't distinctive, there's a number of cringe-worthy facepalms. Chicago's Fire For Effect seize on the slow, belaboured theatricality of ""Post Physical"", turning it into something saccharine and overblown, while the less said about Craxxxmurf's headache-inducing take on ""Touching Transform"" the better. Dimensional Rip 7's sheer size has one advantage, however: For every misstep there's a good remix lurking behind it. Ritualz's ""Alien Trance remix"" of ""Post Physical"" takes hold of the trance thread that weaves through Egedy's work and turns it rubbery and warped, while Adeptus lay down a bed of lush synths and acid gurgles, turning ""Trancegender"" into the aching duet with Zola Jesus it should have been in the first place. Dimensional Rip 7 features some prominent and well-timed guests, too. Montreal woman-of-the-moment Grimes dismantles ""Real Is a Feeling"" and reconstructs it into one of her own pins-and-needles skeletons, infusing the track with her breathy coos for a remix so delicate it almost sounds out of place on a package full of speaker-blown hymns to homemade dance music. But the crown jewel undoubtedly belongs to makeshift chop'n'screw master Physical Therapy. The New Jersey producer's own distinct style-- taking huge samples and inflating them until they're puffy clouds of distortion and then drenching everything in sad, defeated, lean-dripping slowdown-- is more than compatible with Pictureplane's, and his take on ""Post Physical"" layers sirens, heavy metallic breaks, and the original's stirring synth riff. It's one of the collection's few moments that feels truly innovative, one of the American underground's weirdest personalities putting his imprint on another bizarro underdog. That inspiring collaboration sits atop a veritable heap of information-overload excess, and a project as cheeky but quietly ambitious as Pictureplane deserves nothing less than a sprawling song-vomit remix album. Like most of what he does, it's far from tasteful and not always all that great, but the highlights are some of the most fun and carefree electronic music from this side of the Atlantic. There's been a lot of talk about the American ""new rave generation"" fueled by artists like Skrillex and Deadmau5, but it's really Pictureplane that embodies everything caricatured in images of those neon-clad teenagers. Honestly, Dimensional Rip 7 is a complete mess and not even close to a coherent listening experience, but its highs are high enough to make wading through the mud a worthwhile endeavor.","Pictureplane mastermind Travis Egedy's free download series has played host to a handful of jumbled, messy mixes.

Freermasonry,Wold,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cfb1335d7bf169a4c1/1:1/w_160/b931f131.jpeg,2012-01-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16147-freermasonry/,Profound Lore,"The catchall criticism for noise as a form of music is that, because it often seems so unordered and illogical, it must be simple and pedestrian. Play some for a cynic, and short of outright disapproval, you'll probably be greeted with a categorical response: ""I could do that, too."" There are a handful of mostly irrefutable ways to come back at that idea-- ""Well, you didn't,"" for instance, or, ""OK, tell me how."" But don't be so snappy, not yet: Noise music, at least for me, should retain some element of mystery, some air of unknowing; after all, if it's an intentional obliteration of the structures and sounds you've known from the first time you heard ""Electric Company"" or ""Sesame Street"", it should force you to ask the most basic questions of what it is, how it is made, and why it is made. And in the quest for those illusory answers, the best noise, drone, and sound experimentation should either pull you in or blow you away, reaffirming that the thing itself is more provocative than the motions behind it. This is all to say that Freermasonry-- the obliterative sixth album from Wold, the Saskatchewan act led by the incredibly named Fortress Crookedjaw-- is ultimately enigmatic and entirely unknowable, an intersection of noise, metal, and electronics that doesn't yield to such plainclothes criticism. Mean, dense and multivalent, with a lyrical conceit based on Masonic symbolism and Biblical scripture, it's the rare loud music that begs to be louder still if you're to have any chance of understanding it. Freermasonry is a case study in controlling the illusion of chaos, an elegantly constructed nightmare of sound where hearing one layer of serrated screams, static bursts, and feedback flares means you've missed some mass of activity somewhere else. Weirdly seductive rhythms tumble beneath a laundromat of blown-out tones and crackling vocals, generally pulling your attention a dozen different ways. I've been listening to the album consistently for three months now, and somehow, I'm still surprised by what its 58 minutes sound like and accomplish. Paradoxically disorienting and direct, Freermasonry is a constant tumult of surprising activity, more unforgiving than most everything in the noise, metal, and drone scenes, places where Wold kind of fits. It's not an album you casually hear and dismiss by saying, ""Oh, yeah, I could've made this."" (Even defining the ""this"" is hard enough.) Remember how those backwards rock'n'hits sounded vaguely demonic? Imagine those sounding truly malevolent, but with solid structure, buried subtlety, and an ideology developed well past the point of boogeyman Satanism. Freermasonry isn't Wold's most damaging effort; the slyly named 2010 disc Working Together For Our Privacy turned three songs into a 35-minute suffocation, where an instantaneous deluge of distortion squashes everything beneath. About 2008's torturous Stratification, Wold member Obey once said, ""We transmogrified the idea of our soundscape to fit the notion of an unrelenting winter storm."" This time, Wold actually make some concessions to cohesive album flow, beginning with the two-minute garble ""Opening"" and always putting a relatively short track (be that three or six minutes) between 11- and 12-minute strangleholds. With its faulty click-clack rhythm and mix of lascivious and lugubrious lyrics, the strangely alluring ""Dry Love"" essentiallly sounds like Cold Cave with its Prurient component grossly amplified. With its disruptive subdural bass and five-verse structure about ""bloody crescent moons,"" ""Annex Axe"" even suggests dubstep (think Coki) ground down by a blender. Similarly accessible moments dot Freermasonry, from the jumbled dance that starts the closing title track to the rock-like eruption that begins ""SOL"". But don't take those references as hints that Wold are somehow taking it easy; rather, these moments of relief or familiarity simply make everything else that much more punishing, so that, when the beat all but disappears on the title track after several minutes, you actually mourn it. This album always peaks at its most extreme, especially with a series of three long, harsh sermons of invective-- ""Free Goat of Leviticus"", ""Dragon Owl Didactisism"", and ""Working Tools for Praxis"". With quoted Scripture and a developed revisionist theology, these tracks harangue definitive Biblical heroes, positing that ""Peter epitomizes the sadomasochistic spirit of the New Covenant"" and, later, ""Lucifer… is a better tomorrow and the bringer of a future."" The sound matches the spirit perfectly, with three-dimensional folds of splintering static and garbled lines creating an anxiety strong enough to shake any beliefs.","With a lyrical conceit based on Masonic symbolism and Biblical scripture, the obliterative sixth album from Saskatchewan's Wold is an enigmatic intersection of noise, metal, and electronics.

Kinks in Mono,The Kinks,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e1ea9e61561daa69d9/1:1/w_160/917c5105.jpg,2012-01-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16161-kinks-in-mono/,Sanctuary,"When people say the Kinks are one of their favorite bands, they likely have a very specific Kinks in mind. And no, it is almost certainly not any version of the band that existed after 1970, though there were quite a few of them. There are good songs sprinkled through the latter-Kinks discography, sometimes even in generous clusters, but the band almost everyone means when they say ""The Kinks"" is really ""The Kinks in the 1960s."" Sanctuary's new Kinks in Mono box collects the entirety of the band's 60s output, in mono, as the title implies, and in that respect, it's a can't-miss collector's item. The music from this period of the band is unimpeachable, so really the question that surrounds a release like this is: Who needs it? If you're in any way prone to dropping $150 on a Kinks boxed set, there is a pretty good chance you already own all this music, and if you bought the individual album reissues Sanctuary released in 2011, you already have the albums in mono, because those reissues included both stereo and mono versions on separate discs (except for The Kink Kontroversy, which has only ever been available in mono). To be fair, it's a well-designed package clearly created with a lot of love, and it does augment the band's first seven albums with three discs of mostly essential EP and non-album 45 tracks, but this, too, does little to distinguish it from those earlier releases, which were generously appointed with bonus material. There is a reason that the Kinks' catalog is so constantly revisited, of course-- its quality and enduring appeal pretty much ensure that record labels will be finding new ways to carve up the band's legacy and repackage it as long as people are willing to buy it in some sort of physical form. They established themselves early with their energy and their shredded-amp heaviness. Their albums, EPs, and singles from 1964 and 1965 are the most uneven included here, but the good stuff is really, really good. The punky, distorted guitars on ""You Really Got Me"", ""All Day and All of the Night"", and ""I Need You"" are still thrilling, and there are a lot of relative obscurities worth listening back to, from the sharp Merseybeat of ""You Still Want Me"" to Dave Davies' slow and yearning ""I Am Free"". The thing about listening to all of this band's 60s output at once is that it shows a very clearly and incremental progression from that material to the establishment of the band's signature identity as the British rock scene's foremost appreciators of English life. While almost every other songwriter working in a rock band at the time was talking about altered states or sticking it to squares, Ray Davies developed a vocabulary of traditional English life, and even mocked Carnaby Street fashion on ""Dedicated Follower of Fashion"". The Kinks were culture without the ""counter"" prefix, a rock band that anomalously acknowledged the dignity in the middle-aged woman who went out and bought a hat like the one Princess Marina wore, the one that adopted the mannerisms of music hall without pastiche or irony, the one that sang about tea and gooseberry tarts and favoring neighborhood life over new patterns of development. The band's 60s output culminated in Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), a sweeping panorama of a post-war Britain that had lost its long-cherished identity, a portrait of a family about to be separated by a hemisphere's worth of ocean as the son and his wife move to Australia, leaving behind the title character to keep calm and carry on. I love psychedelia and teenage rebellion, but I get the sense that a whole lot more people lived in the England Ray Davies wrote about than in the one everyone else sang about. We're trained to think of things like Antonioni's Blow-Up as the definitive portraits of London in the 60s, but that's just part of the story. Arthur standing on the dock is just as big a part, if not bigger. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more sensitive extended document of this England than you can hear on this set. Whether you need to unload your wallet for it is another story. If you like the 60s Kinks but don't own any of their music and want to, well, here you go. You can't go wrong, and they're a band that presents well in mono. There's little in the way of audio experimentation on their records, and even their densest recordings, especially on Arthur, don't need the added depth of a stereo picture to succeed brilliantly (the mono versions are uniformly better in the car, for instance). So yes, the music's as brilliant as it ever was, and it's all here, well-housed. The only question is whether that's enough.","This 10xCD boxset collects the entirety of the Kinks' 1960s output, in mono as the title implies.

Fallen Empires,Snow Patrol,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f613d197565213a872/1:1/w_160/400523ed.jpeg,2012-01-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16178-snow-patrol-fallen-empires/,PolydorIsland Def Jam,"The world of UK guitar music has changed in the decade since Snow Patrol signed their first major-label contract. A passing glance at the state of British mainstream radio neatly illustrates how it's shifted for bands of their ilk: When Snow Patrol inked a deal with Polydor's Fiction imprint in 2002, Steve Lamacq still lorded over evenings on Radio 1. His ""Evening Session"" show was where I first taped songs by bands like Idlewild, Snow Patrol, and Seafood. Tune in tonight between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., and you're more likely to catch Guetta or Skrillex than an ""indie"" pop band. It's pretty much the same during the day, when hyperactive bass music and loud, super-compressed pop music hold court. You might think bands like Coldplay, Snow Patrol, and Elbow would be beyond trying to square up to that world, but Coldplay ushered in some subtle shades of R&B production on last year's Mylo Xyloto, and on Fallen Empires Snow Patrol pick at similar threads with electronic touches of their own. That change in direction is evident on opener ""I'll Never Let Go"" as arpeggiated synth notes open and then carry the entire song. The build from there is slow-- growing as distorted guitars throw weight into the chorus-- but the song reaches ridiculous proportions when folk-pop singer Lissie provides gospel singing toward the finale (warning: she pops up on an additional three songs). You get the sense they're shooting for something epic, something that would sound just as big as the pop bangers on radio, but the results are goofy. Electronics appear heavily on another four songs, enough for the band to describe the album as a showcase for their ""secret love of Techno."" Listening to those songs, it seems less the product of five guys who secretly listen to Michael Mayer backstage before playing to 10,000 people, and more like somebody who might enjoy the techno preset demo on a Yamaha keyboard. They sound more at ease in the second half of the record, returning to the territory of big ballads and acoustic guitars. That portion of the album's ushered in by ""Berlin"", a charming instrumental that sounds more like Sufjan Stevens or Jónsi (Owen Pallett and Nico Muhly provided arrangements here and elsewhere). Less edgy, sure, but signifiers like that are a much better fit for a band that has always had a knack for big arrangements. Songs like ""Lifening"" and ""New York"" bludgeon with sentiment, but one of these per record could probably keep Snow Patrol in business for life on rom-com movie scores alone. They're the exact kind of home runs you get the feeling Snow Patrol could hit in their sleep. Which makes you wonder if, in the future, instead of toying with awkward electronics they might be better served sticking to what they already do pretty effectively. I mean, nobody's going to have Skrillex as the first dance at their wedding.","Snow Patrol have called this new album a showcase for their ""secret love of techno."" The collection does feature electronics, along with arrangements from Owen Pallett and Nico Muhly and a heavy dose of female gospel vocals.

Headcage EP,Matthew Dear,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30bc0084474cd0c2067/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16194-headcage-ep/,Ghostly,"Matthew Dear's transformation, from bedroom techno polymath to live-band leader, occurred over such a long, seamless stretch that it's easy to take for granted just how surprising (and rewarding) it's been. In 2003, Dear's wonky vocal anthem, ""Dog Days"", could have been taken as a micro-house producer's novelty, a cheeky attempt at merging sappy indie pop with alien sound design. But while he kept on recording ""straight"" techno in a bewildering array of styles, Dear's records under his own name continued shucking dance music's rules, rhythmic and otherwise. Techno's precision kept his Afrobeat and art-funk fixations from devolving into jam-band aimlessness. And lessons learned from those genres made his machine textures appealingly strange, rather than preset bland. The four song Headcage EP both picks up where Dear's last record left off and shakes its influence enough to suggest where he might be headed next. Or maybe not. Like any good techno producer, Dear appreciates the EP as an artform in itself, rather than a way to rush out a set of not-too-dissimilar songs to keep fans happy between albums. That said, it might also be the least ""techno"" material Dear's recorded. Two of the songs verge on a kind of singer-songwriter's ambient, floating by with almost no backing at all. A third sounds like a sensitive rocker got hold of a Soulja Boy track and decided to make the best of it, with winning results. This is Dear as laid-back charmer, rather than forbidding electro architect. Compared to the dark (but not bleak) journey of 2010's Black City, where Dear transposed the ""nighttime drive"" claustrophobia of old-school techno to a set of intricate almost-rock jams, Headcage shakes off the late-night jitters for a sound so airy it threatens to evaporate into murmurs and empty space. *Black City'*s density suggested that Dear was drawing aesthetic energy from what most of us would just suffer as the stress of living in a tightly packed urban environment. Here he seems to be yearning for the room to chill. The dark electro of Headcage's title cut, vaguely reminiscent of various early-1980s British synth-pop bands without quite sounding like anyone specific, might inititally trick you into thinking the EP will be the afterparty to *Black City'*s bash. But Dear relaxes into something more comfortable and blissful as Headcage plays out, suggesting two possible routes for his music in the future. ""In the Middle (I Met You There)"" is one of the most surprising cuts Dear's put his name to since ""Dog Days"", a love song crooned (by the Drums' Jonny Pierce) over a bright hip-hop loop, not too dissimilar from the 8-bit fizz being peddled by producers like Clams Casino, that he fleshes out with shifting layers of keyboard buzz. It's as delightful-- chillwave with actual hooks and a sound rich enough to swim in instead of just wash over you-- as it is unexpected. But ""Street Song"" and ""Around a Fountain"" do away with anything as coarse as drums, unless a flicker of static repurposed as a rhythm counts, suggesting TV on the Radio at their most amorphous and then taking it even further. (Though given that Dear's always sung like this, it's an interesting question as to who got there first.) It's hard to imagine Dear constructing an entire LP out of such seemingly insubstantial stuff, but he might just be able to pull it off. Even in this beatless world, he brings his techno producer's instincts out, dropping just enough in the way of fleeting, right-place-right-time hooks to catch your ear when it's ready drift away from the song. It's a good example of how a grounding in ""functional"" dance would do a lot of avant-rockers a world of good.","This laid-back four song EP both picks up where Matthew Dear's last record left off and shakes its influence enough to suggest where he might be headed next.

Dark Matters,Expensive Looks,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fe9d034d5c69bf4c57/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16185-dark-matters/,Group Tightener,"Alec Feld, a young New York native who goes by Expensive Looks,  earned good notices a while back for ""Nothing More"", a radiant song about loneliness. At this point, you could be forgiven for feeling sleepy whenever you hear hazy synthesizers mixed with a wayward drum pattern. But even though it arrived hopelessly late to the chillwave party, ""Nothing More"" was just too sticky to discount. It helped that Feld's voice, which wouldn't sound out of place on a Wolf Parade or Animal Collective anthem, was strong and commanding. But on Expensive Looks' debut LP, Dark Matters, the single is something of an outlier. It turns out that Feld's interest in that kind of immediacy is limited, which accounts for both Dark Matters' appeal and limitations. Feld's music has a ravey, enervated grandeur, but the glare of style sometimes seems like a way to mask the lack of substance. Dark Matters feels like the solution to an equation whose variables include Toro Y Moi, Neon Indian, Nite Jewel, Bibio, Baths, and Elite Gymnastics-- a timely concoction of lo-fi disco, corroded analog textures, submerged bass, chipmunk soul, and granulated funk. No one's saying that Feld is ripping anyone off-- this stuff is all just in the air. But that doesn't change the fact that this sound is currently feeling threadbare. That's why my favorite track on Dark Matters is also the weirdest: opener ""Your Dreams Our Week"", which is divisible by only itself. Each stem of the track feels like an independent process, and you get the sense they could slide apart at any moment. The result is a track with genuine tension, willfulness, and originality. In this strange way, Feld's music may be best at its worst. Errors enliven it. This kind of audacity doesn't surface again until the last track, ""Vanishers""-- which, unfortunately, is a senseless mess; the only seriously bad stretch on an otherwise charming record. The songs between ""Nothing More"" and ""Vanishers"" are pleasant to zone out to, with potent moments of dark euphoria, but hard to remember. With the possible exception of ""Moving Visions"", the pop songs fall short of the heights of ""Nothing More"", while the little interstitials feel random. It's good fun but never pushes against anything, which is no fatal flaw, but no revelation either.","On this debut LP, the young New York City native Alec Feld-- whose voice wouldn't sound out of place on a Wolf Parade or Animal Collective anthem-- creates synth music with a sleepy grandeur.

Iron Balls of Steel,Loincloth,by: Hank Shteamer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b302ea9e61561daa6a0c/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-18 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16188-iron-balls-of-steel/,Southern Lord,"Picture a sasquatch strolling up to you on a busy street, and you'll get a sense of the surprise inherent in this, an honest-to-god Loincloth LP. For nearly a decade, the band-- a burly, ultra-technical instrumental-metal outfit with members split between Raleigh, N.C. and Richmond, Va.-- lurked in the shadows like some cryptozoological beast glimpsed only in a handful of tantalizing photographs. Prior to Iron Balls of Steel, Loincloth's complete discography totaled four songs, lasting a few seconds shy of 12 minutes. But there was magic in those tracks (first issued on a 2003 CD-R demo, with two of the selections also appearing on a Southern Lord 7"" and a third on a Swami Records comp), which subjected majestic doom to merciless rhythmic dislocation. Their resolute rawness was like a stop sign held up against better-known technical-metal bands like Meshuggah, whose complexity is tempered by mechanistic coldness. In this one brief dispatch, Loincloth proved that it was possible for metal's essential caveman-ness to coexist with its burgeoning brainiac impulses. Yet for all their musical conviction, Loincloth seemed ambivalent at best about their bandhood; the quartet never emerged for even a single live gig, and for years, an ill-maintained MySpace page was all that signified their existence. It seemed reasonable to conclude that Loincloth's hibernation was permanent. Late 2011 brought bittersweet news: A Loincloth LP was finally due, but for reasons they're keeping private, the band had completed it without guitarist Pen Rollings, a key presence on the demo and a cult-hero avant-metal artisan known for his work in the head-spinning early math-rock trio Breadwinner. Rollings had helped bolster the Loincloth legend via a hilariously outspoken Chunklet interview, in which he mocked Norwegian black metal's humorless facade (a sentiment expressed on the demo via the track title ""Church Burntings"") and discussed his experiences navigating the underground rock scene as an openly gay man. On paper, the loss is a bummer, but the disappointment fades once Iron Balls starts spinning; remaining guitarist Tannon Penland handles the increased load via skillful multitracking, and the band's fearsomely precise rhythm section-- bassist Cary Rowells and drummer Steve Shelton, both also of the recently reactivated Raleigh progressive-doom outfit Confessor, whose polarizing 1991 masterpiece, Condemned, planted the seed for Loincloth's insular obsessiveness-- sounds huger than ever, abetted by a crisp, full-bodied production job. Crucially, the 16-track, 38-minute Iron Balls isn't just an entree portion of the appetizer delivered on the demo. Penland, Rowells, and Shelton seem to understand that their unwaveringly maximal math metal can be numbing, and they've found novel ways of adapting their aesthetic to the LP format without opting for obvious compromises like guest vocalists, covers, or the dreaded remix. (A few tracks do make tasteful use of ambient-style atmospherics, either as a backdrop or as interstitial material.) While some pieces here follow the zero-frills M.O. of the demo-- brutal brain-scramblers that exhaust themselves in little over a minute-- others strive for and achieve an actual emotional arc, an epic narrative sweep that places Iron Balls in the company of recent work by wordless prog-metal titans Dysrhythmia. The best of the bite-size pieces are breathless marvels. ""Hoof-Hearted"", the album's shortest track at 75 seconds, juxtaposes a needling solo-guitar break with vertiginous drops into a hard-swinging, full-band groove. After the initial kick-in, the band works its way up to a series of white-water accents and quickly yanks the rug out, again leaving Penland alone. The trio recaps this sequence in various fractured forms, as though feeding their theme through a series of irregular gears; even after repeated listens, the track retains its dislocating power, but the basic motifs lodge firmly in your head. In contrast to the material on the demo, tracks like ""Hoof-Hearted"" and Iron Balls opener ""Underwear Bomb""-- in which a swaggery, prog-blues riff lumbers forward in the face of almost comically relentless mathy digressions-- leave you feeling strangely fulfilled, not merely pummeled. On some tracks, technicality overwhelms coherence. The dizzyingly nimble ""Shark Dancer"", for example, shows off Steve Shelton's trademark stuttering double-bass work (never simply a cruise-control drone) and counterintuitive use of cymbals (marked by rigorous hand-muting and oddly placed thwacks), as well as Cary Rowells' intrepid mirroring of his rhythm partner. But the piece zooms ahead without a clear thematic thread and fails to make a lasting impression. ""Slow 6 Apocalypse"", which exhausts itself in a fit of Morse-code turbulence, feels similarly elusive. In contrast, several more fleshed-out pieces here transcend the stone-faced chug of the demo-- not to mention the pervasive silliness of Iron Balls' album and track titles-- and achieve an improbable pathos. ""Stealing Pictures"" begins as headlong midtempo math rock, fueled by cyclical riffs that churn and mutate without pause, but around the minute mark, the tempo halves and Penland picks out a poignant theme redolent of warm-blooded 1990s post-hardcore (Quicksand comes to mind). Later in the song, the band returns to this passage and lingers on it in uncharacteristically patient fashion. ""Long Shadows"" fixates on its own captivating motif, woozy yet crystalline, which the band uses as a launchpad for a weighty avant-doom adventure. On these pieces, as well as other highlights like the glimmeringly textural closer, ""Clostfroth"", Loincloth peel back their armor-plated exterior to expose the beating heart within. By recording a full-length, offering listeners a clear 360-degree view of their previously shadowy creation, Loincloth have put their valuable, longstanding mystique on the line. Iron Balls could've easily revealed that the project worked best as a one-off lark, thriving on the strict limitations of the EP format. But it turns out that this monster looks many times more intriguing up close; without taking any easy shortcuts, Penland, Rowells, and Shelton reveal here that their beast harbors genuine beauty. The disc ought to have the proud, few Loincloth faithful weeping with joy, but more importantly, it leaves room for a broader audience to hear what the fuss was all about.","Over the course of a decade, the highly regarded ultra-technical instrumental-metal outfit Loincloth's discography totaled four songs. The N.C.-Va. trio's debut LP leaves room for a broader audience to hear what the fuss was all about.

Friend of the People,Lupe Fiasco,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ff9d034d5c69bf4c5b/1:1/w_160/cover.jpeg,2012-01-18 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16186-lupe-fiasco-friend-of-the-people/,self-released,"Google ""Lupe Fiasco sucks"" and ""Lupe Fiasco greatest rapper alive,"" and you will find yourself confronted, on both sides, with a whole lot of results. Even in rap music, where 90 percent of musical arguments begin and end with side-choosing and insult-hurling, Lupe is a lightning rod. What has he done to deserve such scorn? What has he done to warrant such blind devotion? The answer to both questions, unfortunately, is ""not enough"": Lupe's so gifted that he remains nearly impossible to tune out completely, but his career is a sad little parable about the danger of wasted talent. Perhaps he can sense this perception in the air. Because like most rappers who've made promises to the conscious-rap crowd that they have no intention of keeping, Lupe's music has grown increasingly sour, half-assed, and defensive as he's traveled further from the glow of his Chosen One days. Listening to Friend of the People, his wearying, dispiriting latest mixtape, you don't leave with the warm and fuzzy feeling promised in the title; you come away thinking that Lupe's underlying message these days feels closer to, ""Here you are, you ungrateful motherfuckers; I've given you something else beautiful to tear apart."" Friend of the People comes out a little more than a year after Lupe's last mixtape, Enemy of the State, but if there's a thematic link between them, it's beyond a dog's range of hearing. Enemy of the State was short, punchy, and highly enjoyable; for a third of Friend of the People, you feel actively punished for paying attention. Part of the problem is beat selection: On Enemy, he skip-roped nimbly over Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"" without embarrassing anybody, but on Friend's ""Lupe Back"", he allows UK bro-step goons Nero to assault us with endless, bowel-loosening bass drops. Fiasco sneaks in some eyebrow-raising rap-industry jabs-- producer deals, B.D.S., ""only as hot as your last beat""-- but they disappear in the chaos. Production has always been an Achilles' heel for Lupe: He's nimble enough to make you listen to him rapping over anything, but his tin ear tests this hypothesis far too frequently. Mainstream, aggressively macho dubstep seems to be his latest thing: Besides Nero, we get Bassnectar's remix of Ellie Goulding's ""Lights"" for ""Lightworks"" and alpha-bro Skrillex on ""SNDCLSH in Vegas"". Lupe throws every flow he's got against these steel-beamed, charmless corporate-office structures, but his reedy voice slides harmlessly right off. He also goes out of his way to show us he's keeping up with indie, sampling ""On'n'On"" from Justice's garish hockey-prog new album, and skimming some starry-eyed shimmer off the top of M83's ""Midnight City"". I couldn't help but wish he would stop straining and find some tracks that work as viable rap beats. There are fleeting moments on Friend of the People where he encourages you to look past all these problems. ""Joaquin Phoenix"" is full of head-turning lines, both self-deprecating (""Fitted hat is Reynolds wrap/ Because I don't trust the government"") and silly (""You be on that glory hole/ You don't know who you fuckin' with""). On the page, when he's engaged, Lupe is invincible. Even his quasi-philosophical nonsense comes with a poetic touch-- ""Atheism's cheaper and accepts Visa"" might not mean anything, but it's a sharply turned, gnomic phrase. He even drops an incredible floss rhyme on ""Supercold"" just to show us he can: ""Christmastime diamonds singing carols on my chest/ Step up off the jet, lookin' like a pharaoh in the flesh."" But he's just as likely to waste our time recounting the plots to 1990s gangsta movies (""Double Burger w/Cheese""). It cuts to the core of Lupe's problem: there's almost nothing he can't do. Sadly, he never does anything much.","Lupe Fiasco's new mixtape samples Justice and M83 and shows a strong interest in aggressively macho dubstep.

CYRK,Cate Le Bon,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f713d197565213a876/1:1/w_160/6fe25fd9.jpeg,2012-01-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16179-cate-le-bon/,Control Group,"In a 2009 interview with Pitchfork, Super Furry Animals' frontman Gruff Rhys admitted he was first drawn to the Velvet Underground because he thought they were fellow Welshman, having noticed John Cale's familiarly regional accent on White Light/White Heat's ""The Gift"". In light of this anecdote, his ongoing mentorship of Penboyr-raised/Cardiff-based avant-pop chanteuse Cate Le Bon amounts to more than just an elder statesman lending support to the next great Welsh hope; rather, in Le Bon, he presumably hears the genuine realization of that mistaken assumption. While Le Bon's cool, disaffected voice was a natural fit for Rhys' electro-fied side project, Neon Neon, the music she creates under her own name more closely resembles The Velvet Underground & Nico relocated from Warhol's Factory to a Welsh farmhouse, displaying an equal affinity for narcotic melodies and jangle-riff repetition, but with the East Village grime replaced by a certain lambswool coziness. Like many debut albums by folk-schooled solo artists trying to assert their identity, Le Bon's Me Oh My (released in 2009 on Rhys' Irony Bored Records label), could come off as both whimsically precious (""Sad Sad Feet"") and state-of-the-world serious (""Terror of the Man""), but showed a willingness to disrupt its serene surroundings with cutting lyrical barbs and well-timed blasts of psychedelicized guitar fuzz. The follow-up, CYRK, does little to upset Le Bon's pastoral, turn-of-the-1970s prog-pop alchemy (as she sang on Me Oh My, ""I like what I like and I like what I know""), but as its title-- the Polish word for ""circus""-- indicates, it's several degrees more playful and irreverent. Where Me Oh My tended to reveal its charms and idiosyncrasies gradually, CYRK lets its guard down almost immediately with ""Falcon Eyed"", a scrappy, start-stop gallop that suggests Le Bon has been trading pen-pal notes with the Fiery Furnaces' Eleanor Friedberger. The song's punkish drive proves anomalous to what follows, but its mischievous energy carries through to CYRK's statelier turns as, much more so than on Me Oh My, Le Bon uses her deadpan delivery to droll effect. She takes particular delight in infusing innocent, golden-oldies-radio sounds with decidedly unromantic sentiment: ""Puts Me to Work"" is an ode to domestic unrest and ennui that nonetheless boasts all the sweetness and grace of the first-dance selection at a wedding, while ""The Man I Wanted"" finds her communicating desire for her one and only through a catatonic stare, before opportunistically asking him, ""Where is the payout?"" But more than just chart her progression as a singer and songwriter, CYRK also sees Le Bon and her four-piece band developing into a crack psych-rock outfit that consistently leads the songs into unexpected places, from the wiggy guitar jams that overtake the title track and ""Fold the Cloth"", to the piano-rolled clamor on ""Through the Mill"" that sounds like a haunted house coming alive after dark. Tellingly, the closing two-part suite ""Ploughing Out"" serves as an autobiographical testament to LeBon's personal and musical evolution, beginning as low-key lullaby referencing her country roots and then yielding to an anthemic, acid-rockin' celebration of escape (""we'll be on the last boat out of here,"" she repeats excitedly) that spirals into joyous, saxophone-fired cacophony. Le Bon's days as a farmgirl in northern Wales may be long behind her, but she's clearly held on to certain agricultural principles: namely, that the right amounts of patience and nurturing can produce glorious yields.","The cool, disaffected Welsh avant-pop chanteuse's second album is more playful and irreverent than her debut, a 2009 collection released by collaborator/mentor Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals.

Voyageur,Kathleen Edwards,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f5ea9e61561daa69f2/1:1/w_160/0c8262cb.jpeg,2012-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16176-voyageur/,ZoeRounder,"Kathleen Edwards' fourth album, Voyageur, was co-produced with Justin Vernon, the man behind Bon Iver and creator of Pitchfork's 2011 album of the year. His involvement, along with the fact that they are dating, will inform the way many people approach the record, especially since it finds Edwards striking in some new musical directions. After building three albums on a sturdy country-rock Canadiana frame, she jettisons the bar-band guitars and twangy vocals in favor of a bigger sound marked by gauzy production and a fuller band that includes Vernon along with members of Megafaun, Francis & the Lights, and Peter Wolf Crier. It still sounds like an Edwards album, but it's not hard to hear Vernon's influence. It's there in his yawping vocals on ""Chameleon/Comedian"" and in the bicycle bell on ""Going to Hell"", a sound that's quickly becoming his signature. And he may well be present in the lyrics, which chronicle not the end of one relationship and the start of another. The latter is most evident on the album's most upbeat song, ""Sidecar"", which evokes the dizzy excitement of new love, chronicling nothing more momentous than a whole day spent together. So Voyageur is both a break-up and a hook-up record; it's less about relationships than the spaces in between, where regret over the past and worry over the future can overlap and overwhelm. Accordingly, there's more drama and dynamism in these songs than in her past work, as Edwards reshapes her sound to accommodate those themes. Instead of the guitar solos and full-band jams that sounded like genre accessories, she gives over more space to more complex instrumental passages that build or fade theatrically. Some listeners may ascribe such moments on ""Mint"" and ""Change the Sheets"" to her new collaborators, but Edwards was examining these ideas on 2008's Asking for Flowers, an album that rethought the inner workings of her songs while still grounding them in hardscrabble country music. That record wasn't as ambitious as Voyageur, but it was rawer, rougher, and better. In fact, Edwards often sounds lost in these new songs. She has a great voice-- dusty and rambunctious-- and she still knows how to bend or break a note to add almost unbearable gravity to a particular line or phrase, but the new material asks her to strain her vocals uncomfortably, especially when she's singing wordlessly during those instrumental passages. Generally, she's keener on sensical lyrics than on voice-as-sound; she's an interpreter, so the meanings of words often inform her delivery. On ""Mint"" and ""Going to Hell"", her voice loses much of its personality without lyrics to guide her. Thematically, these new musical avenues fit the lyrics nicely: Each song emphasizes change and risk, and Edwards never resorts to tired sentiments or platitudes about healing and hope. On the other hand, she does entertain a particularly tortured, hell-in-a-handbasket metaphor on ""Going to Hell"" and writes a few clunkers on ""Change the Sheets"" (""Change the sheets and then change me""). That is as new and startling as any sound on the album, as in the past Edwards has proved to be a very careful songwriter who made every line count. But Voyageur is her most traditionally confessional album, and while that might allow other singer-songwriters a bit more gravity and urgency, here the more intimate focus limits her lyrical range and stunts the album's impact. Ultimately, it's a question of perspective. Edwards has written convincingly and often devastatingly about other people, attempting to view the world from the point of view of an abducted girl, a haggard housewife, or a woman carrying the baby of a criminal. That empathic endeavor lent her songs real bite, allowing her to sum up an entire life in a few well-chosen words. But on Voyageur, Edwards seems to get outside herself, never tries to get another angle on any particular issue, which saps the songs of their humor as well as their imaginative power.","Kathleen Edwards co-produced her fourth album with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, jettisoning country rock in favor of gauzy production and a band that includes Vernon plus members of Megafaun, Francis & the Lights, and Peter Wolf Crier.

Blue Dream & Lean,Juicy J,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f2c0084474cd0c203b/1:1/w_160/7ce32d26.jpg,2012-01-17 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16177-blue-dream-lean/,self-released,"Juicy J cuts to the chase early on Blue Dream & Lean: The entire chorus of ""Juicy J Can't"", the album's third track, is, ""You say no to drugs/ Juicy J can't."" It's informative, though not completely necessary on a mixtape that derives its title by rhyming the slang for cough syrup and soda with the name of a strand of weed. Juicy-- one half of legendary, and legendarily bizarre, Memphis rap group Three 6 Mafia-- seemingly spent most of 2011 ingesting enough recreational drugs to make Nikki Sixx raise an eyebrow, and paying producer Lex Luger for beats so he can rap about it. Blue Dream & Lean is basically a continuation of Juicy's two collaborative mixtapes with Luger, Rubber Band Business and Rubber Band Business 2. Despite Luger's producing only nine of the album's 28 tracks, beats by Sonny Digital and Juicy himself work off of Luger's blueprint, which itself is partially filtered down from the type of dark, head-knocking production of classic Three 6. The success and failure of the mixtape are two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, there's cohesion to Blue Dream & Lean that serves it well. The result of Juicy's chanting about taking drugs over tracks that are largely similar is that he pulls you into his world, one where narcotics blur everything together until one day you have a 28-track mixtape, yet you still need to title every song, but you're so stoned that you just pick the dominant line from every chorus. Lesser artists have tried much harder to achieve the same effect and failed, and Juicy pulls it off effortlessly. The flip side of that, of course, is that a 28-track mixtape featuring Juicy J chanting over largely similar beats is far too many tracks, especially on the heels of two related tapes. Blue Dream & Lean could be chopped in half and be no worse for the wear, but that's par for the course. It's a shame, too, because a combination of the best Luger-style tracks and the few songs that go in a different direction would make for a very good album. The opening quarter of the mixtape is especially inspired, as it finds Juicy at the point where he's most concentrated on casually, almost mindlessly, talking shit. Interspersed throughout the album are songs like ""Big Bank""(produced by Drumma Boy, one of the most diverse producers in the South) and ""Stoners Night 2"", which break up the slight monotony but deserve to be highlighted even further. The latter, done by notable up-and-coming producer Harry Fraud, features a lush, soulful sample that's a breath of fresh air amongst the album's suffocating palette. The latter part of the tape gives shine to blog favorites like A$AP Rocky, Spaceghostpurrp, Alley Boy, and Kreayshawn, all of whom sound much too eager to please. And though that's perfectly understandable, it's quite jarring considering that Juicy is trading in his ability to make the listener believe that he's self-destructively destroying his body regardless of the consequences. Kreayshawn at least managed to score the best chorus, and she and Juicy repeatedly asking each other, ""you trippy, mane?"" is the only time any of the aforementioned guests come off as carefree enough to hit on the album's vibe. Blue Dream & Lean is allegedly Juicy's first offering as a member of Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang, and though hot new rappers using their newfound power to sign legendary veterans that have faded from the spotlight almost always leads to a failure to meet inflated expectations, there's enough here to suggest that Juicy could put out a really good album with the input of a dedicated editor.","One half of Memphis' legendary Three 6 Mafia offers a continuation of his two collaborative mixtapes with Lex Luger, a druggy 28-track album featuring guest spots from A$AP Rocky, Spaceghostpurpp, and Kreayshawn, among others.

Hymns,Cardinal,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2faea9e61561daa69fc/1:1/w_160/e5ca8bcb.jpeg,2012-01-17 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16181-hymns/,Fire,"Eighteen years ago, a multi-instrumentalist from the West Coast and a songwriter from Australia released an album under the name Cardinal. It wasn't a huge hit, but it did exert a big influence as one of the first albums of the 1990s to explore lush chamber pop in any depth. (Chamber pop is pretty much a nucleotide in the DNA of indie rock today, which makes it easy to forget that it wasn't always that way.) The original 1994 Cardinal album was met with a flurry of acclaim, but its spending many years out of print-- it was finally reissued in 2005-- meant not many people heard it after that initial burst. The American half of the duo, Eric Matthews, went on to have a successful career, releasing solo albums and arranging for a lengthy list of other artists, including Elliott Smith, Tahiti 80, and the Dandy Warhols. His partner, Richard Davies, who had already played in the Moles, has kept going with a low-profile solo career. There seems to be no particular occasion that prompted their reunion, but their re-emergence after such a long break, sounding basically like they used to, does afford us a chance to see how things have changed in almost 20 years. Their sound, a fairly basic brand of mostly mid-tempo, low-key indie rock adorned with brass fanfares and other decorative orchestration, doesn't stand out as much as it did back in the days of grunge, but it is still distinctive. Thing is, for as much attention as they got back in the day, Cardinal never made the most instantly memorable music, and that holds true here as well. Davies likes to run his vocals through subtle processing, and he especially likes doubling himself singing clean on one track and processed on another. Often the only effect of this is that it blunts the melody. Matthews answers those melodies with big bursts of trumpet, but those answering statements can sound more mannered than felt-- across the album, there's hardly any syncopation, and with pretty much everything happening between the bar lines, the album sounds tight and staid even as it shoots for grandeur. This is not to say Hymns doesn't have its moments. The first time Matthews hits us full-force with the brass, on ""Carbolic Smoke Ball"", it imparts a Bacharachian sweep to a song that otherwise walks in place. The reverberant piano of ""General Hospital"" nicely conjures the image of a cold, empty hospital hallway; the upbeat ""Love Like Rain"" is a welcome diversion into something approaching power pop; and Davies' closing refrain on ""Rosemary Livingstone""-- ""I want you to change/ But stay the same""-- is a funny way of stepping outside the band for a second and getting into the head of a listener who maybe doesn't know what he wants from this reunion. Fair enough. The reunion wasn't expected, and while it's nice to finally hear these two follow up on a promising debut, Hymns isn't likely to capture many people who weren't taken with the original Cardinal record.","In 1994, Eric Matthews and Richard Davies released an influential chamber-pop album under the name Cardinal. Almost 20 years later, they've reunited for its follow-up.

Evolve or Be Extinct,Wiley,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f45e6ef959693223a3/1:1/w_160/78f71b75.jpeg,2012-01-17 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16182-evolve-or-be-extinct/,Big Dada,"In the early days of grime, say around 2002 or 2003, it was easy for Americans (many of us still using dial-up to snag single MP3 transmissions from the London underground) to feel like we'd never be able to keep up. Almost a decade later, it still feels impossible, but for entirely different reasons: Whether we're talking about freestyles caught on cell phones in clubs or fully thought-out mixtapes, the brand-newest shit from grime's young turks and old hands is now instantly accessible. Much like the current state of U.S. rap, grime unleashes an avalanche of semi-underground material every month, and you can catch a headache just thinking about trying to process everything. No one represents the promise and perils of this state of affairs better than Wiley, still one of the genre's most distinct voices and crucial producers. Up until 2006, you could listen to the entire recorded output of this grime godfather, from bedroom beat experiments to charting singles that reshaped UK urban music, in just a couple of hours. Now it's arguable that even Wiley can't remember every track he's released in the past half-decade. In 2007, he put out no less than six ""best-of"" mixtapes, and he hasn't slowed down since. If anything, since his brief brush with the UK mainstream in 2008 thanks to the pop-dance undeniablility of ""Wearing My Rolex"", he's sped up, as if his thwarted dalliance with a major label allowed him to see the futility of releasing one ""official"" album every few years in a cloud-based world. But Evolve, available through the auspices of real-deal label Big Dada, is clearly being marketed as one of the Wiley releases you should pay closer attention to. And you should. Gone are the sickly sweet R&B choruses from his last LP, Chill Out Zone, a sometimes gorgeous but mostly misguided foray into grime-goes-quiet-storm. From opener ""Welcome to Zion"", we're clearly in old-school Wiley World, as defined by the chilly synth tones and hand-drum-and-computer-clonk rhythms of his earliest singles like ""Igloo"" and ""Eskimo"", albeit with a fresh-for-2012 production upgrade. It's no surprise to learn he's hooked up on a few tracks with Mark Pritchard from Africa Hitech, whose best music similarly brings together twisted quotes from the history of rave and manic polyrhythms that feel conscious of Afro-Cuban tradition and post-human at the same time. In the early days, no other producer had Wiley's strange feel for lurch-and-stagger funk, for a shouldn't-work-but-does kind of syncopation, and it's nice to know he hasn't abandoned his bizarre way with beats in favor of comfortably waist-winding grooves. Wiley hasn't totally given up on crossover success, and Evolve is no way an hour-long return to pirate-radio mic-busting brutalism. But even the cuts aimed at dancers rather than freestyle trainspotters have a pleasingly off-kilter feel that owes more to the wilder side of dancehall and its endless global mutations. ""Boom Blast"" is an obvious stab at the party-rocking electro that's everywhere in mainstream pop these days, but with wilder drums and a more menacing vibe. Its resemblance to ""Like a G6"" merely points out how stark that chart-topper was, rather than how pop Wiley can go. He sounds revitalized as a rapper, too. Gone are the mushy-soft love rhymes from Chill Out, blessedly replaced on many of Evolve's deep cuts with the reams of breathless and bracing East London slang and hard-won introspection that once marked him a potential UK Nas rather than a fleet cockney Ja Rule. When he does indulge in mere playa braggadocio, there's often a wicked and knowing silliness to help the boasts go down, and the wildstyle bass manipulations on tunes like ""Link Up"" and ""I'm Skanking"" once again shout, ""I'm a badman,"" as loudly as the rhymes. Plus his sense of humor remains as twisted and idiosyncratic as ever. Perhaps only Wiley would concoct a minimalist, almost gothic instrumental and then turn it into a skit about how hard it can be to catch a cab. It would be a shame if you do overlook Evolve out of fatigue, since its one of his best, a mostly single-minded return to the on-the-mic fierceness and computers-go-tribal rhythms that first made his name. But it would be totally understandable. In 2010, he threw 11 .zip files of new beats onto an unsuspecting internet. I can barely remember a single thing about that particular data dump, except a feeling of amazement slowly giving way to exhaustion. In 2011, he put out not only three mixtapes, but two of those as official albums, at least one of which was another semi-classic almost lost in his manic flow. And not one to let more than six months go by without a new transmission from the Eskibeat bunker, he's already back with his eighth available-in-stores full-length in a little less than eight years. This one's a keeper, though, and if you've tuned out on grime over the last few years, either from negligence or overload, here's an easy way to reenter grime's current moment, even if Wiley will likely declare it old news in a couple weeks.","It's arguable that even Wiley can't remember every track he's released in the past half-decade, but the grime godfather's new LP is one you should play closer attention to.

Fuck Da City Up,T.I.,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2edb1335d7bf169a4ed/1:1/w_160/1f0c3a27.jpeg,2012-01-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16174-ti-fuck-da-city-up/,self-released,"T.I.'s place in rap history has been established; when he was counted out after his major-label debut barely rippled, he released a series of buzz-building mixtapes that culminated in a Southern hip-hop classic, Trap Muzik, a point when he claimed his spot as King of the South. On Urban Legend he swatted at upstarts who would challenge him. And with King, he crashed through to the national stage. By the time of Paper Trail, the rapper had crossed over completely, with ""Whatever You Like"" becoming the his first No. 1 hit. Beneath this narrative of triumph, of course, was a tumultuous undercurrent: A friend was killed in front of him, drugs abused, and unthinkable paranoia led to felony weapons charges, jail time, parole violations, and more jail time. While an artist like Gucci seemed so reckless with the opportunities he had earned, T.I. always gave the impression that he was striving to escape that trap. Fresh from his most recent dalliance with hard time, the rapper is back in the scrappy mode of his early days; as it's ever been, the worst thing you can do is count him out. But while Fuck Da City Up finds the rapper in a hungry mode, it also has a vague sense of listlessness. It's difficult to get a feel for the rapper's story. He seems to have left the personal narratives and ethical tensions that charged his earlier works behind. In its place, he has shifted his focus in twin directions: proving he's still got the energy of a rapper half his age (he does). And proving that he can still make bangers. This is where the tape doesn't reach the bar set by earlier efforts. It doesn't help that Fuck Da City Up dropped around the same time as Jeezy's comeback record, and shortly before Ross' oxygen-stealing Rich Forever. Because T.I. just can't do blockbuster rap bangers like those two. His style was more dexterous nuance than bludgeoning Scarface mantras. Here, his best moments seem to rely on the talents of his guests to create some (admittedly impressive) chemistry. Witness the superteam of Travis Porter, Young Dro, Tip, and ""I'm on One""-producer T-Minus for the showstopping ""Hot Wheels"". ""On Purpose"" is another highlight, and the collaborative team of Trouble and T.I. (""It's 'Trouble Man' riding with Trouble, man, them mu'fuckers in trouble, man"") have a very real musical symmetry; it's easy to imagine that Trap Muzik's sense of moral strength may have had a heavy influence on Trouble's 2011 mixtape December 17th. Sonically, you'd be hard pressed to argue that anyone but T.I. picked out these beats; bouncier and heavier on regal horn parts than the typical rap record today, they retain the King vibe even though the producer names have changed. Perhaps the best production comes from Hit Boy, who laces the amusingly named ""Harry Potter"" with a shimmering wall-of-sparks beat that deserves a better title. T.I.'s rapping throughout the tape retains the balance of smooth style, a perfect Southern rapper's accent, and the ability to telegraph energy through a dazzlingly rhythmic flow. But ultimately, the songs simply aren't there, certainly not ones that will rival Ross', and T.I.'s narrative here feels too weakly articulated to make up for songwriting shortcomings. While relying on biography to invigorate his raps a decade distant from the street life might be unrealistic, when his music was at its most fascinating, his willingness to wrestle with the moral dimension of his experiences helped streamline his music, giving it verisimilitude that felt in short supply in the cutthroat world of street rap. It gave some of the more plain moments an impassioned purpose, which allowed the listener to ignore hip-hop's cult of Bangers. It also helped sand down the rough edges on a musical level; while Jeezy's monolithic sound could sweep up listeners in its pure, epic, and totalitarian vision, T.I. was always too flawed, too self-aware to go for those sorts of transparent theatrics. This made for compelling rap music when his story was central. But when the only story is the one arguing for your own relevance, you end up with a lot of sound and fury.","Fresh from his most recent dalliance with hard time, this mixtape-- featuring guest spots from Young Jeezy, Nelly, Dr. Dre, and others-- finds T.I. back in the scrappy mode of his early days.

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo OST,Trent ReznorAtticus Ross,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f8b1335d7bf169a502/1:1/w_160/8b030a3d.jpeg,2012-01-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16180-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/,The Null Corporation,"Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score for The Social Network was brilliant because it worked as a conventional film score even though its approach was boldly unconventional. The pair assembled a dense but brittle map of drones, foreboding sound effects, and delicate melodies, submerging acoustic sounds in pools of digital filters. The result was something suited to filmmaker David Fincher's work-- brooding, mysterious, and tinged with anxiety. The film world agreed: Reznor's first foray into soundtrack work after putting Nine Inch Nails on hiatus landed him both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Who knew? Fincher clearly has confidence in their abilities, as he tapped Reznor and Ross once again to score his latest movie, the film adaption of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. With the team earning another Golden Globe nomination, it would seem like they're doing something right. Dragon Tattoo doesn't differ drastically from Social Network but it's not a retread. For starters, this one's a three-hour beast, spread out over three CDs, six vinyl LPs, or a whopping 39 digital files. So while The Social Network could be received as a digestible standalone product, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo doesn't offer the same sort of flexibility. That's in part by design as much as structure: Where The Social Network had discernible motifs like ""Hand Covers Bruise"" and pseudo-techno like ""In Motion"", the music here is more obtuse, focused on building tension and defining space rather than conveying feeling or emotion through melody. Which means there are few standout tracks; instead, the most arresting moments emerge out of layers of increasingly damaged sounds that set an uncompromisingly bleak mood. The score's overcast outlook is well suited to Fincher's portrayal of Sweden as an outwardly and proudly modern country overrun with the dehumanizing potential of technology. It's a place haunted equally by industrial remnants of past eras and shameful personal and political histories. The task of Reznor and Ross is to create something conflicted between technology and tradition, and they opt for a sound that's essentially future-baroque: fiercely plucked strings, ominous bass, decaying chimes, and spare pianos held together with meticulous post-processing. But where Dragon Tattoo excels in its role as soundtrack, it falters in listenability: imagine something like Ghosts I-IV but almost double the length and without all the catchy parts. True, it is easy to admire the sheer complexity of their work in small doses. Pieces like ""Hypomania"" drift into clouds of hellish distortion and re-emerge, while ""Oraculum"" features vividly tactile drums that feel heavily removed from your typical Hollywood percussive suspense music. So while this might be a soundtrack, it rises above mere Hollywood muzak. As the set drifts into its third and final disc, the pace begins to pick up and form shapes that might be recognizable to Reznor adherents. ""Great Bird of Prey"" could be an instrumental leftover from The Fragile days, while ""Infiltrator"" weaves in and out of sections of intensely energetic movement. ""An Itch"" traps what sounds like human screams and moans beneath an actual beat, while the warbly ""Closer"" piano even makes a reappearance in ""The Heretics"", a sly wink and nod to its composers' considerable musical history. For those fans who wouldn't want to spend $300 on a 6xLP box set of soundtrack music, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is likely to remain a curiosity apart from its two bookending vocal tracks. The movie's sleek opening sequence is soundtracked by the Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"", a mean reminder of the power Reznor's pop music holds at its most ferocious. On the other end of the spectrum, the three hours wind down with a cover of Bryan Ferry's ""Is Your Love Strong Enough?"" by How to Destroy Angels (the band composed of Ross, Reznor, and wife Mariqueen Maandig). To hear a human voice so bright and clear after what's come before is a moment of pure pop relief. But pop is not what Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is about. It's reasonable to question the necessity of a score whose sprawling mass exceeds the length of the film it's meant for. But even if it doesn't quite work as a standalone experience, the real takeaway here is that Reznor and Ross may be ushering in an exciting new realm of possibility for mainstream film scoring.","Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross follow their award-winning score to David Fincher's The Social Network with this bleak three-hour The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo soundtrack, a sprawling mass that exceeds the length of the film it was meant for.

Morning & Sunrise,Jakob Olausson,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c5ea9e61561daa69a8/1:1/w_160/53238156.jpeg,2012-01-16 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16136-jakob-olausson/,De Stijl,"Jakob Olausson's 2007 debut album Moonlight Farm was a brilliant psych-folk gem, and its strange, secluded aura was reinforced by the fact that, at the time, Olausson was living as a beet farmer in rural Sweden. Since then, Olausson has maintained a marginally higher profile, touring extensively with the likes of Wooden Wand and Matt Valentine, and performing freer forms of jazz/improv in his duo Sus & Jakob. Despite all this activity, Moonlight Farm seemed such a distinctive, stand-alone piece of work that it never seemed necessary to expect or require a sequel. So the appearance of Morning & Sunrise comes as a very pleasant surprise, particularly in that it finds Olausson returning to the evocative terrain of Moonlight Farm without simply repeating himself. On the surface, Morning & Sunrise would seem to be just as homemade as Moonlight Farm, but apparently the album has undergone several stages of mixing before being finished by Jarvis Taveniere of Woods. The completed work is slightly less folky, more electric and more rock-inclined than its predecessor, and in several places it sounds not all that far removed from the lo-fi Woodsist/Captured Tracks axis. Yet using primarily the simple tools of double-tracked vocals and echo-coated guitars, Olausson still creates his own inimitable narcotic atmosphere, and even at its most propulsive his music retains a unique sense of time-distorting gravity. And if nothing else Morning & Sunrise certainly shows that Olausson still knows how to cultivate a little mystique. The album comes wrapped in a sleeve that is a perfect recreation of exactly the sort of private press obscurity that collectors love to find in the Goodwill bins, and Olausson is characteristically vague about the album's personnel. So when trace elements of percussion or gentle loping bass emerge from the soupy mix, there is no telling who is playing, and it is possible (if not probable) that everything is being overdubbed by Olausson himself.  This sense of facelessness suits Morning & Sunrise just fine, as in the final mix all the instruments blend into the same gauzy frame regardless, with Olausson's moody, Skip Spence-like baritone nodding off in front. Given the album's powerful loner/outsider vibe, most listeners might be conditioned to expect Olausson's songs to show signs of being somehow disturbed or depressive. Oftentimes, however, on Morning & Sunrise the opposite is true, and on such tracks as ""Don't Drown in Sorrows"" or ""When Your Bridges Burned"", his lyrics can read almost as quiet motivational speeches, as though he intends to give the most laconic pep talks in history. ""You don't know what you're asking, when you're asking him to stay,"" he advises some unseen friend, ""Trying to keep him close to you is just pushing him away."" This element of sage guidance has a disorienting effect when coupled with the music's sedative flow, particularly when followed by the likes of ""Neptune"" or the title track, where Olausson's vocals can periodically disintegrate completely into the darkening echoes, sounding as if the oracle has faded after it has provided as much counsel as it can. Transfixing as his voice and words can be, on ""Riding on the Wind"" and ""Doctor's Deeds"" his guitar work is deceptively lucid and wholly captivating. And though there are fewer unexpected instrumental flourishes than on Moonlight Farm, there are discreet touches-- a ghostly whistle here, a shuffling country rhythm there-- on every track to reward those ready to sink deeper into the music's enveloping grip. As a whole the album makes an excellent companion piece to Moonlight Farm, even if it lacks some of that record's initial otherworldly, where-did-this-come-from impact, and raises anticipation for further dispatches from Olausson in the future.","The Swedish psych-folkie and beet farmer follows his brilliant 2005 debut Moonlight Farm with a more electric, more rock-inclined offering that finds him returning to the earlier record's evocative terrain without repeating himself.

Natural Traits,Ernest Gonzales,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e75e6ef9596932238d/1:1/w_160/b6296e8e.jpeg,2012-01-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16167-natural-traits/,Friends of Friends,"San Antonio's Ernest Gonzales has been the quiet cornerstone of the L.A.-based Friends of Friends label, one of the American west coast's most consistently surprising dance outfits.  Gonzales' music is about the beauty of contrast and dichotomy, whether it's the collision of lifelike guitar and 8-bit synthesizer on his previous solo album Been Meaning to Tell You or his mixture of the cinematic, sepulchral, and cultural with the down-and-dirty dancefloor as Mexicans With Guns. His latest album picks up on the themes of Been Meaning to Tell You, and as the title Natural Traits might suggest, brings those ideals of nature to a more genune hybrid. Natural Traits finds itself at home in a whitewashed world of pastel and rounded shapes, avoiding the hectic, everything-at-once sprawl of modern ""bass music"" (particularly the American variety) in favor of careful, deliberate movements. To call it simple would be diminutive, but there's something distinctly digestible and affable about the slow-but-steady way Gonzales builds his tracks. It's typified in the album's stately opener, ""The Prudence of Evolution"", methodically layering soft drums on top of chords on top of two delicate 8-bit synth melodies that intertwine like DNA strands yet nimbly sidestep the juvenilia so often associated with the sugary sound. Those 8-bit feelers are the dominant melodic device on Natural Traits, a thicket of flinty frequencies that never quite loosens its curious tension: The synth almost always sounds brittle and trebly, set against gorgeous, reverb-heavy guitar jangle and a set of drum sounds that range from hollow to realistic. When the two opposites combine, as on the beautiful beatless centerpiece ""Peaks & Valleys"", the result is somewhere between summery indie rock and something more indebted to electronic music, a divide toed by the record with every track so that it occupies an in-between space in keeping with its equally middle-ground array of sounds and textures. It's an attractive medium rather than a middling one, however; Gonzales' resolution is one that engenders approachability rather than dilution. As MOR as Natural Traits might sound, however, it willingly engages with dance music in a more direct way than Been Meaning to Tell You. Like his Mexicans With Guns project, however, they're rarely ""dance"" in a definitively genre-indebted, quantized sense. Take highlight ""The Sentimental Sea"", Gonzales' riff on 130-bpm house: The kick thumps balefully with little flourish, but a fluid, slippery loop brings it closer to something like sensual dub techno. That is, until Gonzales' warm streams of bass and uplifting guitar plucks flood the track's second half, turning it from arch savant-house into a landscape teeming with lush life. Elsewhere, the percussion gets lost in a tug of war: In ""When Synchronicity Fails"", Gonzales anticipates the rigid housey lope with a billowing guitar riff that trips over itself, synthesizing syncopation out of thin air, while ""The Heroic Lives of Particles"" plays with swung dubstep-leaning percussive patterns that lend a certain groove to the track's loose synth scribbles. They're moves that should be disorienting but instead sound easy in Gonzales' confident hands. Natural Traits succeeds largely on account of its relative modesty and transparency-- sometimes the most satisfying records are the ones where you can guess exactly how everything was built in the first place. Undoubtedly Gonzales' strongest statement yet, it comes one step closer to achieving that impossible fusion of the synthetic and natural, quietly experimental in spite of its own humility.

It's the Arps,Todd Terje,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ee9d034d5c69bf4c4a/1:1/w_160/e4631320.jpeg,2012-01-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/,Smalltown SupersoundOlsen,"In the parlance of the increasingly vocal menswear blogging community, Todd Terje is ""having a moment."" A combination of serendipity and opportunism, a moment is a flash of triumph, unplanned and difficult to reproduce. To offer some perspective, cargo pants are also having a moment. Like Terje productions (as opposed to remixes), cargo pants disappeared for a few years mid-decade; now they're back, and they look (sound) better than anyone remembers. Hell, it was only six months ago when, upon asking a friend if he had any interest in a Terje DJ tour stop in Chicago, I received the following curt reply: ""No. I don't want to listen to a bunch of space disco shit."" But Terje's three-song Ragysh EP-- the one that included year-end chart barnstormer ""Snooze 4 Love""-- dropped and proved surprisingly sticky. This month he follows that with It's the Arps, a four-track EP on ""space disco shit"" mothership Smalltown Supersound, composed with an ARP2600 analog synthesizer. The first line of Vintage Synth Explorer's ARP2600 entry is, ""The ARP 2600 is without a doubt one of the finest analog synthesizers ever."" Terje has always been a sound-- and not a retro-- fetishist. Why else devote his precious remix work to nu-disco bench players and classic rock mammoths in equal measure? It's no surprise then that he'd be tempted by a mystical artifact such as the Arp, which, like many old synthesizers, looks like the kind of rune-encrusted rock-toy that his music's implied spaceships set out in search of. (The former astrophysics student is a rumored future space traveler.) Terje's own productions-- like those of labelmate Lindstrøm-- favor knob-twiddling disco, like Giorgio Moroder without the pop-vocal instincts. He's confident and gifted enough to throw away an all-time piano loop on a Bryan Ferry remix. On It's the Arps, he trades the sturdy eight-minute structures of Ragysh for a baggier and more colorful sound. ""Inspector Norse"" would be a pro-forma space-disco jam in lesser hands-- it has that bulbous bassline, the tint of humor-- but Terje transforms it into a daytime noir, one that spreads its pinging notes wide. The star of the show is the two-track ""Swing Star"" suite, part one a wicked treadmill of double-time sequences over blocky bass and hiss-y drums. It's synth music as roadside fireworks: Light the fuse and back away quickly. ""Swing Star Pt. 2"" explores the same chord progression but with a cleaner palate, and the result is a light-breeze boogie that feels like a comedown. (The fourth track ""Myggsommer"" is a narrow miss, a vine-y synth doodle that suggests vintage synth flippancy can be as precocious as vintage guitar-tone exercises.) This might've been lost in the space disco explosion a half-decade ago, but with his contemporaries wandering off into prog, kraut, and sundry other forms of out-music, the clean lines and easy momentum of It's the Arps are really refreshing. And Jesus, it's fun. The trouble with moments, of course, is extending them. Terje has the imagination. An upcoming Roxy Music remix suggests Terje will be a more consistent presence, which is fantastic: I'd really like not to be comparing him to fedoras in 2017.","

Unexpected Victory,Raekwon,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ec9d034d5c69bf4c48/1:1/w_160/bf0cc202.jpeg,2012-01-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16170-unexpected-victory/,self-released,"The avalanche of mixtapes that accompanies every new year has positively blanketed 2012 in rap music, with seasoned veterans and hungry newcomers alike sending 2011 off with one last test of the DatPiff download limit. While Rick Ross' grandiose Rich Forever mixtape, on sheer size alone, has threatened to blot out a lot of its Q1 competition, solid efforts abound for hip-hop fans-- this has been the single best month in what seems like years. It's here, in this overcrowded field, that Wu-Tang dynamo Raekwon has unleashed Unexpected Victory, essentially his first full-length release since 2011's fine Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang LP. In any other month, Victory might eke out a few more ways to live up to its title. But for Rae, spitting criminology raps over grimy orchestral stabs and murky slivers of soul isn't exactly unexpected, and-- armed with a crop of passable productions and an uneven roster of guest stars-- rarely smacks of anything like victory. Victory splits its time between fellow New York vets (Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, C.L. Smooth) and relative newbies (Fred Da Godson, Chicago's L.E.P. Bogus Boys), and holds to a fairly tight-knit stable of guest rappers and producers (Sauce Money, Scram Jones) eager to cook up a slinkier take on post-RZA muck at the Chef's behest. Flossy, almost Rossian widescreeners ""Just a Toast"" and ""Luxury Rap"", the sinewy, stretched-out soul of ""Silk"" and the Just Blaze-nodding ""MTV Cribs"" bring a little light to the proceedings, but the sound here mostly hangs out in the dank realm Rae's been favoring forever. Victory's greatest flaw is its wildly varying fidelity; listening, you'll have to get up every few minutes to work the volume knob, and even then, you may not be able to make out everything that's going on in, say, the hissy ""The Brewery"". Still, on a tape that could use a few more outliers, skits, practical jokes, something, this little bit of audience participation works wonders for engagement; you'd probably never hear Ceazar-n-Reason's lackluster ""Brewery"" verses if you didn't have to crank the song so loud to hear Raekwon at all. Couple that with the incongruous appearance of young Altrina Renee's post-Aaliyah/""E-Mail My Heart"" lunger ""Facetime"", and you've got less mixtape, more data-dump: an anything-goes, congruity-be-damned assortment of whatever was lying around at the time. Ever since threatening defection from the Wu following 2007's intoxicatingly odd 8 Diagrams, Raekwon's revealed himself to be a key figure in the Wu-Tang's conservative wing. His much-lauded 2009 LP was, after all, the sequel to one of the more singular LPs in rap history, and while Cuban Linx II wasn't exactly a Xerox, you could certainly see where he'd laid down the tracing paper. Last year's Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang was similar, richly detailed, in-the-pocket mafioso talk over stark, gritty strings. It's a lane Rae absolutely owns, one he's ridden pretty much since the start, and while he should be congratulated for never bending to any whims but his own, his set-jaw consistency doesn't always make for the most dazzling music. He gets some good lines in all over Victory, of course; any Raekwon song with ""Story"" in the title is bound to be a good one, and both ""Soldier Story"" and the 9th Wonder-produced ""A Pinebox Story"" find his masterful narrative skills and unflinching brutality as sharp as ever, still stringing together bits of seemingly disconnected detail until a picture begins to take shape. But, when he drops a Twilight reference in his very first verse here, he seems a little lost without a plot. It can't all be smoke-filled backrooms or alleyway beatdowns, but elsewhere, Rae seems a little scattered, either resorting to stock phrases (""Riding at breakneck speed/ Gimme weed/ Gimme cheese/ I like cheddar"") or finding a reference-- any reference-- that sorta works. (Raekwon, if you're wondering, is on Team Jacob.) The occasional line pops out, but it's rare that he grabs you for a whole verse that doesn't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Victory's guest roster hits more than it misses; the elder statesmen types bring about what you'd expect to the table, though Prodigy had me rolling with ""you tacky like headrest TVs."" It's rising star Fred Da Godson who fares best here, though, noting on ""Luxury Rap"" that he's ""a phenomenon [like] Travolta with the tumor"" who ""should rhyme with some Wallabees on."" But, apart from the irrepressible Busta and a few of the more excitable youths, these guys tend to trade in the kind of cold-eyed, unexcitable confidence Rae does, which-- coupled with Rae's own coolness of demeanor and the general steeliness of these beats-- leaves one with the weird feeling that there's both a lot of Raekwon on this record and not very much Raekwon at all. I was maybe three or four spins into Unexpected Victory before I realized something: I had no idea what exactly Rae meant to promote with its release, what gap he meant to stop by unleashing these songs into the world. I'm told Rae, Ghost, Cappadonna, and the LOX are at work on a collaborative LP called Wu-Block, and of course, there's talk of a new Wu-Tang LP by year's end. To prepare for the new Wu LP, GZA reportedly went to MIT to spend a few days studying mitochondria or something; you'll be pleased to hear there's been no talk of Raekwon shipping off to Le Cordon Bleu for a week of chef's training. Ultimately, you want Raekwon rapping; preferably, you want Raekwon rapping about the grisliest possible subjects, over crackling, cinematic RZA beats. Unexpected Victory's sound is too lousy-- and its stakes too low-- to ever possibly live up to his past glories. What's most frustrating, though, is how little Rae's adjusted to this brave new world of the mixtape-as-album; here's one of the premier album artists in hip-hop history, tossing out what amount to well-intentioned scraps without even bothering to check if the thing's mastered before it went live. Can you blame anybody for burning their first click on Rich Forever?","Armed with passable productions and an uneven roster of guest stars, the Wu-Tang dynamo's first full-length release since 2011's Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang LP rarely smacks of anything like victory.

Future This,The Big Pink,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2adea9e61561daa697d/1:1/w_160/9231aa71.jpg,2012-01-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16122-future-this/,4AD,"Sonically, the  Big Pink's 2009 debut delivered. A Brief History of Love's titanic choruses, huge production, and maxed-out volume were designed to explode on the radio. Though they didn't sound like Britpop, the term was applied anyway because the Big Pink seemed in the swaggering lineage of bands like Oasis, the Verve, and Mansun. But bands who emerge so fully formed sometimes lack staying power and, considering Big Pink co-founder Milo Cordell's roots running Merok Records during the cultural peak of blog-house and nu-rave, the band had to be aware of their potential limitations. The follow-up, Future This, finds the Big Pink as boxed in as their predecessors, recycling the same ideas with less conviction. The drop-off is clear in the album's first few seconds: ""Stay Gold"" bears blatant similarity to their previous hit ""Dominos"" but shifts the lyrical focus from consequence-free sex to homilies about staying true to your dreams. It's a troubling thread that runs throughout Future This: where the Big Pink once mastered the role of magnetic, womanizing loners, here their tilt towards positivity and pursuit of a connection with their audience comes off as uncomfortably needy. This results in ill-defined salvos like ""Jump Music"" that awkwardly try to position themselves as message songs despite having no discernable message. The Big Pink try to build a mythology by dropping references from their debut into new songs, as if the two lyrically divergent records were of a conceptual piece. They also toss in a reference to the Stone Roses' ""I Wanna Be Adored"", establishing kinship with another band that was ultimately sunk by not knowing how to follow up a huge debut. And later, ""Hit the Ground (Superman)"" is every bit as gimmicky as ""Stay Gold"", incorporating a sample of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"" into its halting, Max Martin-like strut and illustrating the fatal flaw of Future This: their need to siphon the power of outside sources-- obvious samples, prefab slogans, even their borrowings from their own music. Where the Big Pink previously sounded invincible, nearly every attempt to intellectualize or streamline their sound makes Future This come off as timid and malnourished. All of which makes the tender ""77"" a surprising closer. Touching on addiction and loss, lead singer Robbie Furze sings, ""You left such an impression on me/ Left on the debris/ Now I'm all fucked up/ And sometimes I forget I miss you."" It isn't exactly poetry, but it does feel unmistakably personal for a band whose most vulnerable song to this point told a lover to leave them alone. It's an awkward start to humanizing the Big Pink, but a start nonetheless.","After the explosive and decadent A Brief History of Love, the Big Pink return with an album that aims for positivity and a deeper connection with their audience.

Five Years With the Sun EP,Arrange,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2dfb1335d7bf169a4d8/1:1/w_160/2ed1444a.jpg,2012-01-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16159-five-years-with-the-sun/,JUKBOXR,"From the remote musical enclave of Fort Lauderdale, the young electronic songwriter Malcom Lacey has posted five Arrange albums on Bandcamp over the past couple of years. High productivity is common among laptop-wielding bedroom auteurs, but Lacey's no data dumper. Each release exhibits unity and care-- its own twist on a rapidly developing sound. The first one I discovered, before anyone knew much about Arrange, was Plantation, which I said was ""thoroughly a breakup record."" But I was wrong. Now that Lacey has done a little press-- such as this interview with a South Florida weekly-- we know more. His first instrument was the piano; he's more inclined to slave over his ambient textures in private than to play shows in public; he likes Type Records and Perfume Genius. None of this was surprising. But one assertion caught me off guard: ""Most of my lyrical content stems itself from an abusive childhood and the relationship I share with my incarcerated father,"" with whom Plantation standout ""When'd You Find Me?"" was a ""one-way conversation."" The revelation casts new light on Lacey's lyrics, which draw opposed qualities-- hostility and tenderness, discretion and confession, self-hatred and self-help-- into uneasy truces. (He'd have fit in well on Saddle Creek in the early 2000s.) On new EP Five Years With the Sun, Lacey is even more furtive than on Plantation, his halting voice washing in and out of audibility, and vanishing for long periods. In hushed tones, he dramatizes the process of a gentle person grappling with dark thoughts-- now scathing, now contrite, lashing out and lashing in. His reticence comes to seem like an impulse for self-erasure, which makes the moments when he overcomes it feel especially poignant. Is this palpable struggle what distinguishes Arrange from a thousand similar peers? It certainly isn't the music's substance, a fairly standard amalgamation of synth-pop, shoegaze, ambient, chillwave, and hip-hop. Nor is it any iconoclastic style-- to the contrary, I prize its preternatural patience and humility. And Lacey is already developing a go-to track structure, which has a smoothly churning undercarriage of piano or guitar tones, ranks of juicy synthetic plucks pulsing above, and mechanical drums splashing the edges of the beats; all topped off with a synth lead that flaps like a tattered banner in a sluggish wind. Maybe it's something even harder to quantify: that vigilant, moody, quietly rapturous sensibility. While the orders of the day are pleasantly zoned-out or ethereally spiritual, Lacey's music feels almost feverishly alert, with breath-catching pauses and mercurial embellishments calling for close attention to its dreamy flow. Below the Kompakt-isms, one hears the dulcet, revolving intervals of the lullaby. This is music as a ward or charm, its hermetic regularity holding a safe space against chaos. (It was recorded, I'm told, in a walk-in closet.) It doesn't sound like a young man hunting for blog buzz. It sounds like a personal search for redemption, or at least some consolation, one moment at a time. Careful sequencing makes Five Years With the Sun feel like an act of tentative revelation through gradual ascent. The immediate pop songs are divided by obscure but quirkily elegant set pieces: ""Gone With the Snow"", where bizarrely treated vocals ride over glassy swells; ""Airplane Notes"", a study in nocturnal counterpoint. The force gathered on the first half rises to a vertex on ""Cure"", a burly production where Lacey opens up his voice with unaccustomed extroversion. ""Mt. Rainer"" vividly evokes traveling up switchbacks, the winds and vistas bending around, leading us up to the bright, clear peak of closer ""Sun Showers"", where all the album's fogs dispel. ""There's a glow/ and I can feel it,"" Lacey sings plainly, ""deep below the hollow point of me."" A couple of inaudibly murmured lines later, we hear, ""the way I felt when I first heard it say…"" But the thought goes unfinished. Instead, a long instrumental passage culminates in a weary guitar anthem, then peters out into running waters. He's not the type to make a sound just to fill space; he waits until he knows what he has to say. That's what keeps me hanging on every moment. Enticingly, the open-ended conclusion of Five Years With the Sun promises more striving, more growth, more suffering and deliverance to come.","In the hushed tones of this brief collection, the young Fort Lauderdale electronic songwriter Malcom Lacey dramatizes the process of a gentle person grappling with dark thoughts.

Fabriclive 61,Pinch,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b5c0084474cd0c1fdf/1:1/w_160/210a7cab.jpeg,2012-01-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16127-fabriclive61/,Fabric,"When Bristol legend Pinch released the out-of-nowhere ""Croydon House"" in 2010-- on the London-based Swamp81 instead of his own foundational Tectonic imprint-- it felt like a sea change. One of dubstep's most influential pioneers, one of its diehard careerists, had made his own version of a house record (and this was before 2011 when it became the norm). In keeping with his usual heads-down dubstep, however, ""Croydon House"" was murky, dim-lit, and paranoid, not your standard garage-influenced thumper, and his tracks since have seen him navigate a no man's land of in-between tempos and experimental rhythms, culminating in the bewildering Pinch and Shackleton collaborative album at the end of last year. It goes beyond just productions: This summer, Pinch started incorporating house into his DJ sets, dedicating sections of his timeslots to the 4/4 stuff. Was he moving on from dubstep? It's this many-limbed and flailing, vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland that Rob Ellis' long-overdue entry in the Fabriclive mix series occupies: The drums still swing and shake with that tribal energy that marks his best dubstep work, but there's not always the snare on the third, and sometimes there's a four-to-the-floor kick. The mix begins mid-track and cleverly continues the conceptual current that's been running through commercial mix CDs as of late: think Four Tet's own Fabriclive go for a similar example of artiness run amok in a dance mix. The nervily pulsating throb of Atlanta producer Distal's ""Venom"" both opens and closes the set, sealing it into a closed circle that, at least in its peripheries, raises questions about the linearity of mixes in the first place. There's an obvious left-to-right motion here, but there's no grand closer, pensive opener, or any real climax: Left to its own devices, Pinch's mix never really ends, the same bumpy journey over and over again, bubbling and bubbling but refusing to boil over. Does it need to end for it to be a satisfying product? According to Pinch, apparently not. This little tweak allows Ellis to play around with the sequencing, and Fabriclive 61 begins with a gallop, running through a surprisingly techno-tinged opening stretch, with French producer F's overlooked (and hugely inventive) ""Slow Down"" colliding with Shed's latest in his rave-techno EQD alias: it's an almost confrontational greeting from someone once associated with the purest of dubstep, and a true sign of the times for both the genre and one of its most prominent heroes.  The mix continues in this vein before fading out into beatless-near silence with Roly Porter's gorgeous mechano-classical ""Hessra""-- at which point Pinch's remix of Photek's ""Acid Reign"" storms out, bringing the mix into more familiar 140-bpm dubstep territory. Where some recent dubstep mixes like Youngsta's Rinse CD or Distance's Dubstep Allstars Vol. 8 were fine showcases of the genre's steadfast traditionalist communities, they were nevertheless tainted by the genre's turn inward (or the formulaic). Pinch's selection of pounding kicks, crash-landing snares, and LFO growls, however, sound both more vital and crucially more alien(ating) than ever. His choice of producers is impeccable, mixing in old stalwarts who are at career highs (Distance's sound is as mean as its ever been, and Goth-Trad's lost in some LSD rabbithole) and producers like Roska and Addison Groove who provide strange, unconventional takes on the median dubstep tempo. It's the most exciting 30 minutes of relatively pure ""dubstep"" since Appleblim's career-defining Dubstep Allstars Vol. 6, taking that staggered ""dungeon sound"" and infusing it with all the psychological paranoia and jagged, jigsaw-puzzle rhythms that defined his own best work, both dubstep and otherwise. So how do we get from dubstep back to whatever Distal's ""Venom"" is supposed to be? Ellis one-ups the ""Hessra"" play, dropping the loping limp of Illum Sphere's ""Promise a Secret""-- a tightknit blend of hyper-compressed string samples that's eventually gutted by Distal's more assertive track-- on top of Om Unit's jerky ""Pressure"". Which brings us right back to where we started, traversing the most current iterations of the bass music continuum as viewed through Pinch's dusty, obsidian lens. What makes the halving between tempos less jarring is Pinch's distinct aesthetic: the music here is damaged, blackened, and always foreboding, no matter what tempo it's pounding at or what genre it might be interrogating. That unrelenting blackness can be suffocating, and it's definitely unfriendly, but it's never boring-- which is a lot more than you can say about most ""dubstep"" mixes these days. So while Pinch might not have moved on from dubstep completely, he's definitely moved somewhere, and it sounds like an exciting place to be.","Dubstep pioneer Rob Ellis' exciting entry in the Fabriclive series occupies a many-limbed vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland: It's damaged, blackened, and foreboding, no matter what genre it might be interrogating.

Inhale C-4 $$$$$,Bebetune$,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2efc0084474cd0c2037/1:1/w_160/078b98cb.jpeg,2012-01-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16171-bebetune-inhale-c-4/,self-released,"James Ferraro is having his moment. Far Side Virtual, a world-building record of Windows start-up screen sounds signifying something about worldwide web convenience and Western cluelessness, landed at the top of The Wire's ""Records of the Year"" list. So polarizing was its placement though, that editor-in-chief Tony Herrington felt obligated to crunch the numbers. I thought the album was pretty good. It's charming at times, and conceptually solid, so there isn't much to fault it for, unless you want to declare the entire conceit complete bullshit, which some have understandably done. ""Remember when you were a little kid dicking with your first Casio for 45 minutes?"" music critic Christopher Weingarten tweeted, ""James Ferraro does that onstage as a grown man."" Far Side Virtual also seemed critic-proof, which was frustrating. If you praised it, well, you were hip to its heady concept, though backed into such a corner that soon enough it may philosophically force you to give ""Best New Track"" to your iPhone's default ringtone. Negative reviews could be dismissed as the listener's simply not getting the joke. Ferraro helped moderate reactions as well. Previously a mystery man without an email address and just a few interviews here and there (and a much noisier, more interesting sound), he went public, doing critics' heavy lifting himself by explicating the album's intentions to Elle, The Quietus, and many others. The guy went viral. He trolled his way into the music conversation. And just as Far Side Virtual inexplicably arrived on year-end lists, he put out a more obnoxious release: The free, victory-lap mixtape under the name Bebetune$. Inhale C-4 $$$$$ finds Ferraro developing a mutant strain of mainstream rap and R&B. Auto-Tune is mimicked, the skittering snares of radio rap show up, and there's special attention paid to the sloppy mastering and obnoxious DJ drops common on mixtapes. It turns out however, that hip-hop actually takes some finesse and knowledge to recreate-- and Ferraro just doesn't have the skills. ""Maccau Celebrities"" cribs its melody from T-Pain and Lil Wayne's ""Can't Believe It"", and though it captures the sound of Wayne's syrup-drunk croons, there's no emotive charm. ""#GRINDLYFE"" has some of the demonic guitar-crunch grandiosity of Flockaveli but does nothing with it, and ""H20"" squiggles around like a Timbaland rip-off. Then there's ""Street Dream$$"", a failed attempt at giving Gang Gang Dance's ""Glass Jar"" the sample-slicing, drum pattern piling, AraabMuzik treatment. It features hi-hats and hand-claps, an airhorn, a dripping water sound, and some Drake-like Auto-Tune-- and it's a mess. Perhaps that's the point, though? ""Street Dream$$"" begins with ""I can hear everything. It's everything time,"" from ""Glass Jar"". It's a quote Ferraro has discussed before. In his interview with The Quietus, he compared the phrase to Nike's ""just do it,"" recommending GGD sell the phrase to Google. It's contemporary rap however, the sound Ferraro is either poorly approximating or lazily mocking, that truly embodies ""It's everything time."" Hip-hop has embraced ""the cloud"" like no other genre, pouring MP3s onto the internet with little interest in how they fit onto an 80-minute CD, running a flowering, free internet industry right alongside the desiccated major-label album landscape. Instead of celebrating rap's industry-bucking impulse, Ferraro misreads the signs and signifiers of the mixtape world as amateurism. DJ and producer tags echoing around in the background of rap tracks not only serve a pragmatic function in an era of no liner notes, telling you who produced a track or put together the album, but add some chaos that can skyrocket an already awesome song onto another plateau. They're part of the fun. In a 2010 interview with Hip-Hop Game, AraabMuzik explained his aesthetic choices: ""I never sampled off vinyl. I've always been digital with it. Mp3 quality. I'm not really with the cracks and the old-sounding, rough, rugged-type sound... I'm with the clear, quality sound."" See, hip-hop's tinny, digitized scream isn't a mistake-- it's a modern update of the golden era's warm, analog hiss. Whether it's mainstream hitmaker Lex Luger and his snarling trap-rap maximalism, or the gossamer, stoned-out electronica of internet beatmakers like the Block Beattaz and Clams Casino, it should occur to Ferraro that he's got a lot in common with rap's creative types. Or maybe he's aware of that and just has a snarky way of showing it. Because the tracks here feel endless, like uninspired, snarky parodies of rap instrumentals, roving along for too long, filled with too many recycled ideas and yet, not one worth considering.","Following the success of last year's polarizing Far Side Virtual, James Ferraro puts out a free, victory lap mixtape, one that finds him developing a mutant strain of mainstream rap and R&B.

Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller I,Drexciya,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f15e6ef9596932239c/1:1/w_160/c5707099.jpeg,2012-01-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16175-journey-of-the-deep-sea-dweller-i/,Clone,"Forget James Cameron and his $200 million budget: Equipped only with outdated Japanese electronics, Drexciya were the true masters of the deep. From 1992 until 2002, the mysterious electro outfit created not only some of Detroit's most original and enduring electronic music; they created an entire imaginary world, one of the greatest myth systems in the history of techno. A new compilation of the group's work, the first in a planned four-volume anthology put out by Rotterdam's Clone label, serves as a crucial introduction to Drexciya's worldview as well as, of course, their music. It's a good time for it: In the past two decades, the meaning of ""electro"" has repeatedly mutated and diluted though its association with electroclash, then Ed Banger's buzzy brand of dance music, and, lately, big-tent commercial rave like Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner. The Drexciya reissue rightly returns the spotlight to the original electro's signature rhythms and analog palette. From their first release, 1992's Deep Sea Dweller EP, Drexciya were obsessed with sub-aquatic realms. Their first tracks bore titles like ""Sea Quake"" and ""Nautilus 12"", and the following year's Bubble Metropolis EP, divided into ""Fresh Water"" and ""Salt Water"" sides and with center stickers depicting dolphins cavorting beneath craggy cliffs, poured it on thicker with ""Aqua Worm Hole"" and ""Danger Bay"". The music was appropriately liquid, with hi-hats like raindrops, bass like the belch of some fanged denizen of the fathomless dark, and blippy melodies bobbing like bioluminescent lures. Adapting the lurching rhythmic template of 1980s electro-funk acts like Man Parrish, Cybotron, and Jonzun Crew, Drexciya emphasized the depth-charge qualities of a booming 808 kick, and the electric-eel jolt of a zapping filter sweep. But it went deeper than that. The music was punctuated by cryptic interludes and scraps of code, like an intercepted transmission from ""Drexciyan Cruise Control Bubble 1 to Lardossan Cruiser 8 dash 203 X"", a head-spinning array of names and numbers relating to something called the ""Aquabahn"". Drexciya weren't just trafficking in metaphor and affect; they were telling a story, one worthy of its own blockbuster film. Their ""Aquabahn"" was, of course, a reference to Kraftwerk, whose robotic method act set an important precedent for Drexciya's own mythmaking. Played out across track titles and cover art, one sheets and liner notes, it went something like this: During the Middle Passage, many pregnant women, sick or dying or simply too much trouble for their captors, were thrown overboard. The fetuses in their wombs, still accustomed to a liquid environment, survived. They thrived, in fact, growing fins and gills, and made their home in the ruins of an underwater city, where they mounted their counter-offensive against human greed and stupidity. The message fit with the militant stance of Detroit's Underground Resistance label collective, with which Drexciya were affiliated, and so did their anonymity. When James Stinson died, in 2002, I'm willing to bet that most fans didn't even know his name, nor that of his collaborator Gerald Donald. Drexciya were rumored to be related to other shadowy electro projects of the era, like Elecktroids and Dopplereffekt-- a creepy, ostensibly antihumanist project featuring showroom dummies on its record covers and vocoded lyrics like ""We have to sterilize the population""-- but in the pre-Discogs era, this was all speculation. To immerse yourself in Drexciya's world was akin to following a particularly far-out comic book, where the misfits wrote the rules and justice always prevailed. It was punk as fuck, frankly-- but from an Afrofuturist perspective. But for all the talk of combat, Drexciya's was profoundly joyful music: impish, rippling, unpredictable, and never anything less than profoundly funky. This is the first takeaway from Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller I. This first volume focuses on the group's first five years, drawing from seven EPs released on labels like Underground Resistance, Submerge, and Warp. (Some tracks have been anthologized before, on 1997's landmark double CD The Quest, but that's long out of print.) Certain tropes predominate: whip-cracking 808 drum patterns, squelchy synthesizer arpeggios, dissonant bleeps and creepy chromatic chord progressions. But there's nothing formulaic about these tracks, which range from the pensive funk of ""Aquarazorda"" to the double-time frenzy of ""Hydro Theory"" and ""Beyond the Abyss""; it's striking to realize how wildly Drexciya's tempos could vary, especially when compared to the deeply regimented BPMs of today's subgenres of electronic dance music. Indeed, Drexciya made few concessions to DJs: there are no 16-bar intros to facilitate mixing, and at least one point, you can hear a synthesizer pattern skip a beat, probably because one of the musicians leaned on his sequencer at the wrong time. Lo-fi by today's standards, recorded straight to tape, in real time, with analog machines, Drexciya's sonics are unfailingly urgent and raw; there's more genuine menace in the roiling ""Sea Quake"" than in practically anything being made today. Clone's Alden Tyrell did a great job with the remastering, preserving the music's wide dynamic range and letting each frequency positively sizzle in space. As hair-raising as the songs can be, it's never an exhausting listen-- unlike too much contemporary electronic music, mastered so uniformly loud that it leaves your ears gasping for air. It's easy to remember Drexciya primarily for their shtick. Academics love them for their applicability to concepts like Afrofuturism and the Black Atlantic. (Kodwo Eshun was particularly brilliant writing about Drexciya; their slippery maneuvers served as the perfect foil for his own techno-theoretical poetics.) Detroit true-schoolers hold them up as examples of Motor City militancy and analog purism. These are all valid positions, but Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller I also reminds us of Drexciya's influence in other contexts, as well. The opening ""Welcome to Drexciya"" is a beatless burble that wouldn't sound out of place on a record from Emeralds or Oneohtrix Point Never, artists more commonly associated with the ""cosmic"" traditions of 1970s synthesizer music. Space is a place, sure. But to immerse yourself in Drexciya's underwater world is to be reminded that there are other dimensions just as worthy of exploration. ""Are Drexciyans water breathing, aquatically mutated descendants of those unfortunate victims of human greed?"" wrote a figure identified as the Unknown Writer in the liner notes to 1997's The Quest. ""Have they been spared by God to teach us or terrorize us? Did they migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi river basin and on to the great lakes of Michigan? Do they walk among us? Are they more advanced than us? How and why do they make their strange music? What is their Quest? These are many of the questions that you don’t know and never will. The end of one thing… and the beginning of another. Out."" These questions had a different kind of resonance in the 1990s, before the answer to every question was just a click or two away, before every new ""anonymous"" artist felt like a walking, talking spoiler alert. To listen to Drexciya today is to wipe the slate clean. We may know James Stinson and Gerald Donald's names now, but their quest feels as cryptic as ever.","From 1992 until 2002, the mysterious electro outfit Drexciya created not only some of Detroit's most original, enduring electronic music, but one of techno's greatest myth systems. This compilation-- the first in a planned four-volume anthology-- serves as a crucial introduction.

Rich Forever,Rick Ross,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2eb5e6ef95969322393/1:1/w_160/78d51a6f.jpeg,2012-01-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/,,"With both Rick Ross and star producer du jour Lex Luger at the top of the rap game, it's easy to forget how much of the former's career is now owed to the latter. Ross was a successful artist before he ever hooked up with Luger, but his stunning transition from begrudgingly accepted popular rapper to one of the genre's most respected artists can basically be traced directly back to Luger's beat for ""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)"", the song that will go down as the indelible single of Ross' career. The beat was so titanic that Ross-- who had gone to great pains to protect the self-constructed image of himself as an opulent drug kingpin-- shouted a chorus where he imagined himself as genuine, real-life drug kingpins Big Meech and Larry Hoover. In one fell swoop, Ross tore down his carefully assembled existence while simultaneously building up the one that paved the way for the career surge he's riding, which has culminated in Rich Forever, the new mixtape that now stands as his artistic pinnacle. ""B.M.F."" is genius for many reasons, but there is one crucial aspect of the song that makes Rich Forever tick: It was the first time that Ross ever really got mean. It's almost incredible to consider, but despite his stature and physical presence, ""B.M.F."" was the first intimidating Ross track since his debut single ""Hustlin'"", the first since then that pumped a dangerous amount of adrenaline into your veins. In the four years between those songs, Ross kept everything but wealth and women at a distance. He chose cinematic, orchestral beats that colored that image perfectly, and while it was no doubt an effective strategy, songs like ""Maybach Music 2"" are the equivalent of a living room in a mansion where you'd be afraid to touch any of the furniture. ""B.M.F."" was Rick Ross as Dave Chappelle as Rick James yelling ""fuck yo' couch,"" except the couch was actually his own. It was exactly what his career needed. Luger produces only one song on Rich Forever, but his fingerprints are all over the mixtape, and its roots are firmly in ""B.M.F."". It's the first Rick Ross full-length with an attitude, and the result is a record where it finally feels like something's at stake for the Teflon Don. The aggrieved sneer of ""…these motherfuckers mad that I'm icy!"" permeates the album, and the energy derived from Ross' contempt adds an important dimension to his character, one that was missing when he got too comfortable making 1,000-thread-count music. The best beats here-- the ones that act as the backbone of the album-- are appropriately sinister, and actually improve on the Luger template that has dominated street rap for the past 18 months. There's the grinding churn of ""MMG Untouchable"", the haunted house bombast of ""King of Diamonds"", and the appropriately glistening keys of ""Yella Diamonds"", beats so good they render Luger's lone actual production (""Off the Boat"") totally unnecessary. The opening quarter of Rich Forever especially drips with disdain, and though deviations into radio pop and the lush instrumentation he's long cultivated do pop up, Ross sets a tone for the record early that courses through every track that follows. ""B.M.F."" did happen to crest with his marked improvement as a writer, but it also magnified Ross' ability to pen spectacularly outlandish and vivid boasts, and he stuffs a vast number of them into the first four or five tracks here. Ross calling his chain ""the ghetto's guillotine"" on ""High Definition"" or his Corvette ""so clean you'll think Bruce Springsteen rent that"" on ""Fuck 'Em"" or conveying his hunger for money by hilariously seething that he ""likes his nachos hot"" on ""MMG Untouchable"" is the mark of the Don at work, not content to merely build verses around the names of luxury sunglasses brands. And when he does retreat back to the throne for a regal track like ""Keys to the Crib"" later on the album, there's an undeniably spiteful glee in his voice that's missing from his earlier albums. Ross has jarred himself out of his comfort zone and gotten his hands dirty, and in doing so he's also fleshed out an image of the boss as paranoid and constantly peeking over his shoulder. ""Last Breath"", which smartly tabs Meek Mill (Ross' top underling) and Birdman (the bossest of all rap bosses) for guest verses, undercuts images of ringside seats and all-white Beamers with a feeling of queasy desperation and lurking mistrust. Then there's ""Stay Schemin'"" which perfectly deploys a zonked-out French Montana to mumble-sing a hook about staying one step ahead of plotting enemies. Montana sounds so stoned that it brings to mind the image of Tony Montana lurching his head up from a pile of cocaine, and it's a fascinating, if not bizarre, end to an album that starts with Ross at his absolute meanest. ""God forgives, I don't,"" is a phrase that pops up from time to time on Rich Forever, and fittingly it's slated to serve as the title of Ross' upcoming album. He'd been batting around the slogan long before this mixtape existed, but Rich Forever adds vindictive muscle to a motto that at one point might have come off as a hollow attempt at branding. It's a record that uses nastiness to cement the character ""Rick Ross"" as three-dimensional, and uses a barrage of bangers to cement the rapper Rick Ross as an undeniable force.","Rick Ross' new mixtape, possibly his best full-length, finds the Teflon Don moving out of his comfort zone and entering a world where it feels like something is at stake.

Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e913d197565213a857/1:1/w_160/4a0a7a06.jpeg,2012-01-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16169-rush-hour-presents-amsterdam-all-stars/,Rush Hour,"It says something about the state of electronic dance music that my favorite aspect of Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars is the fact that ""Vol. 1"" doesn't follow its title. Not that a second volume would be unwelcome; it's that we're in the midst of a run in which most compilations (from the big houses, at least) are weighty, extra-long attempts to define a genre, rep a label, or map a career. They are, in other words, short historical arcs offered by a scene that is still learning how to manage its past. In this context, All Stars is a breath of fresh air, purporting to offer nothing more than a glimpse of the current house music talent operating in or originating from Amsterdam, Rush Hour's home base since 1997. The 12 exclusive tracks offered here are, as advertised, a set of raucous, 4/4 shakers born in the 1980s in Chicago but possessing updated wardrobes. Given the label it's hardly a surprise, but it bears mentioning that All Stars has absolutely nothing to do with the squeaky arena-fodder known as ""Dirty Dutch"" or Dutch House. All Stars might plausibly be presented as an alternative were it not for the fact that the very existence of labels like Rush Hour and their fanbases are testaments to the desire for substitutes. (If a massive Afrojack fan hears this comp and has her eureka moment, I'll swear off colored vinyl for a year.) On the whole All Stars is dense and bold, casting off any minimalist impulses in favor of buzzy machinations that rely on manicured loops in lieu of samples. I hesitate to describe this as an ""Amsterdam sound,"" as it's more likely the result of a youth-oriented lineup. Dexter, Melon, and Newworldaquarium constitute the old guard here, the latter's ""Liberty Hot"" being the comp's most sexual and incisive rhythm. But really the show is in the hands of contemporaries like Tom Trago, whose foggy, see-sawing ""Once Upon a Time in Amsterdam"" stirs my urban Euro fetishism, and the perpetually on-the-verge Juju & Jordash, whose brushed-steel drum programming is refreshingly aggressive. The standout newcomer is Maxi Mill, a producer confident enough to stop momentum mid-track to make way for a burr-laden bassline. There are too many rote sawing strings and punchy synth pads, but Rush Hour proves that Amsterdam is big enough to supply the talent and small enough to prevent All Stars from seeming unwieldy or obvious. If there's an overarching goal here it appears to be to convince you that you could have a good time at an Amsterdam club on a Thursday without a touring DJ in town. Used-CD bins are stuffed with obscure and ultra-specific house compilations from the early 90s. All Stars' small-ball focus is a throwback in this way; five years from now it will likely offer little utility, though I wouldn't make the same bet about the artists contained herein.","This set of 12 exclusive tracks, which offers a portrait of the current house music talent operating in or originating from Amsterdam, is filled with raucous, 4/4 shakers born in the 1980s in Chicago but possessing updated wardrobes.

Live at Artists Space,Mars,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e6c0084474cd0c202b/1:1/w_160/ec606f76.jpeg,2012-01-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16166-live-at-artists-space/,Feeding Tube,"It's hard to pinpoint the beginning of no wave, the abrasive post-punk movement in late-1970s New York. But its legacy had a big bang. It came in the form of an unnamed festival at Manhattan's Artists Space, spanning five nights in May 1978. Brian Eno happened to attend, and what he saw and heard led him to produce No New York, a scene-defining sampler that remains the most well-known no wave record. Some claim it also helped kill the scene, but it's doubtful that any of the music would have such a strong ongoing influence without Eno's compilation. Though No New York included some great work from its four participants-- the Contortions, Teenage Jesus & the Jerks, Mars, and DNA-- no wave fanatics have longed for audio documentation of the Artists Space festival itself, and rumors have persisted that tapes exist. In 2008 two Teenage Jesus songs from the fest showed up on a new collection of their work, but that's been it. Now Feeding Tube has worked with Mars bassist Mark Cunningham to offer the entirety of his band's two-set performance on a single LP. It's fitting that Mars are the first Artists Space participants to get such a release, because the quartet's 1975 beginnings made them technically the first no wave band. But their elemental importance goes beyond mere chronology. Inside their brief lifespan lie the deconstructive, anti-careerist seeds that drove the movement. Cunningham saw their arc as ""a countdown from ten to one,"" and through their sliver of recorded output-- 11 songs totaling barely over a half-hour-- the tired rules of rock got pummeled into abstract art-noise. The same goes for the two sets here, each of which takes up an album side and contains identical songs and running order. When the band revs up with ""3E"" and ""Helen Fordsdale"", their riffy Velvet Underground leanings are apparent beneath amp distortion and vocal squalls. But only a few minutes later, singer Sumner Crane babbles and growls unintelligibly, guitarist China Burg lights string fireworks, and every shard of sound melts like a pile of wicked witches. That path of destruction is even more intense in the darker, nastier-sounding second set. It culminates in a brutal take on ""Tunnel"", as Crane's insane howls make the studio version sound like a dance remix. Oddly, for a band this wild and abstract, such divergence is rather rare here. Most songs are played live the way Mars played them in the studio, a testament to how controlled and honed their seemingly chaotic music actually was. Where you can hear a difference is in fidelity. Live at Artists Space is somewhat tinny and flat, in a way that could wear out uninitiated ears. Part of that can be chalked up to dated source material. But the second set was recorded on professional equipment by the band's label head, Charles Ball, leading some to suggest reasonably that more mastering care (as well as more imagination in the cover design) could have improved this record significantly. Still, Mars' performances during that now-legendary weekend are powerful enough to shine through technical limitations. Because their time was so short, the band spent each moment at a high pitch. All their spilling energy had real purpose-- to show how quickly and thoroughly rock could be demolished using the tools that built it. Live at Artists Space may hiss, but it also crackles with that enervated inspiration. If it's mostly for aficionados, that's ok-- anyone interested in Mars at all is likely a devotee.","Feeding Tube teams with Mars bassist Mark Cunningham to offer the entirety of his no wave band's two-set performance from the 1978 Artists Space festival, the same event that led Brian Eno to compile his scene-defining compilation No New York.

Slime Flu 2,Vado,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cd13d197565213a82a/1:1/w_160/de36af3d.jpeg,2012-01-12 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16146-vado-slime-flu-2/,self-released,"Harlem rapper Vado has transformed himself from Cam'ron's unwelcome new sidekick to a mini prince of NYC goon-rap (with 2010's Slime Flu and last year's Gunz n' Butta) to, currently, That New York Guy Who Isn't Uncle Murda or French Montana-- all in the space of, oh, about a year and a half. In case you were wondering, yes, New York is still a brutal, bewildering, dizzying place to try and make it as a rapper, and yes, keeping up with rap nowadays is still basically a full-time job. That said, I've had more fun listening to Vado (that's Violence and Drugs Only, if you're curious) in the past two years than I have almost anyone else. He's funnier than French Montana and a much better rapper than Murda. Most of the fun stems from the sheer, bellowing-gasbag sound of Vado's voice, which cuts through basically anything you put in front of it. He's a whoopee cushion of infectious ignorance, and he has a class clown's way with ensuring his remarks travel all the way to the front of the room. But he's also a crafty rapper, and his latest mixtape, Slime Flu 2, delivers exactly what the original Slime Flu did-- high-speed, tightly realized, pugilistic goon rap-- to nearly as entertaining results. If it suffers at all, it's largely because it feels and sounds too rushed-out, perhaps in an attempt to re-spark Vado's fast-cooling buzz. He should have kept the album in production for a few more minutes-- even for a free rap mixtape, the mastering is atrocious. The beats knock, but even with headphones, they seem to be bumping through a neighbor's wall, and Vado's voice often sounds distractingly disembodied in the mix. This is odd and regrettable, since the first Slime Flu banged loud and clear wherever you played it, but there is still lots to enjoy. Top honors goes to Vado's ""inspiration"" joint, ""I See You (Black People)"", which surely deserves an award for mind-blowing use of a song-title parenthetical. The song, built on a sepia-tinted piano loop and hand percussion, all but dims the lights and burns the incense, but apart from a single Obama namedrop, Vado's not having it: ""Didn't notice, recession happened when?"" This irrepressible goofiness is the key to Vado's charm. Give him a beat, any beat, and he'll bludgeon his way through it like Yosemite Sam, shooting in all directions. On ""Slime Anthem"", he reinforces his loose Diplomats affiliation by putting together a blatant homage to ""Dipset (Santana's Town)"", and his eyeball-rattling shouting is a dead ringer for Juelz Santana's. But his crisp way with words also allows him to kick gnarled, writerly raps alongside a mumbling Raekwon on the very Raekwonishly titled ""Bed Piss"" without ever sounding young or out of his depth. He can kick funny, credible game to ladies when he feels like it without turning syrupy or abandoning his rap style, just like his mentor Cam'ron (who, by the way, Vado kept from the stage this time) on ""Louis V. Bag"" and ""All the Drama"". There are a couple of fun surprises, too: freestyles over ""Ms. Fat Booty"" (he calls it ""Ms. Slime Booty"", which he should have maybe rethought) and the plush beat from Kingdom Come's ""The Prelude"", one of that album's few salvageable numbers. Absolutely none of this is earth-shaking, nor does it carry that burning sense of now that keeps the frenetic pulse of street-rap moving forward. But Vado will be okay; New York may devour its own, but if he can keep putting out solid projects like this one once or twice a year, he can count on a small, local-hero following. Maybe there's a Lloyd Banks-style ""Beamer, Benz or Bentley"" surprise hit for dude four or five years down the line. It would make me happy to see. Every city needs a solid B-team.","The goofy Harlem rapper and Cam'ron sidekick's new mixtape delivers what the original Slime Flu did-- high-speed, tightly realized, pugilistic goon rap-- to nearly as entertaining results.

OvalDNA,Oval,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c79d034d5c69bf4c0d/1:1/w_160/8adad276.jpeg,2012-01-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16138-ovaldna/,Shitkatapult,"Glitch is one of those microgenres that seemed to disappear halfway through the last decade. When the German outfit Oval-- early on reduced to founding member Markus Popp-- made its return in 2010 with O, it was hard to decide how to react. Especially since O was one of its most difficult and fussy efforts yet, and largely divorced from Oval's previously established and instantly recognizable aesthetic as heard on landmarks like 94 Diskont and Ovalcommers. With a palette based on the sound of live instruments, O lacked some of the algorithmic wizardry of Popp's best work and was a fatiguingly lengthy listen either way. You'd be forgiven for thinking that OvalDNA, coming just a year later and clocking in with another 25 tracks-- and this after the complementary 15-track 12"" Oh-- is something like overkill. Here's the surprise: OvalDNA is actually a collection of bits and bytes from assorted Oval eras past. The even bigger surprise? While it indeed sounds like the old Oval we know and love, there's nothing even remotely scatterbrained or assorted about this one. Not only is OvalDNA remarkably consistent and thematically sound, it's so well-sequenced that its 25 tracks fly by in a glorious, easygoing blur, a far cry from that fatal fragmentation that ate away at O. Its variety renders these sounds in a fluid and volatile technicolor missing from even early records like Systemisch. In a way, it's the best of both Oval worlds.  Included in the package is a DVD with ten bonus tracks, a music video, a documentary, and 2000 AIFF files of sounds and elements from the entirety of Popp's musical output ""intended for music producers.""  Okay, so maybe it's a little overkill, but coming from an artist who made a public installation inviting people to render their own interpretations of his work (as part of 2000's Ovalprocess), it shouldn't really come as a surprise either. Like so much of this music, sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not the decay and destruction that pries apart the layers is accidental or planned, but here the manipulation feels effortless, executed with a smart and steady hand. There are many varieties of Oval on offer, though it's most often a warm-hued, even honeyed sound palette rather than the acerbic distortion of, say, Ovalcommers. While some tracks like ""Savvy"" do focus on harsher, more challenging sounds, even these-- or the hushed, rushed thermal swooshing of ""70 Kino"" and its choked string section-- feel oddly accommodating. OvalDNA doesn't dip into the same well of asceticism as the conceptually driven sound-design experiments you'll find on labels like Mille Plateaux or Raster-Noton; instead, each stutter and skip feels melodically driven, each sample caught and clipped mid-moment like a key to some larger world of musical delights that we're given glimpses of but are never actually led to-- dig the teases at jungle on ""Mare Fax""-- on account of the album's sprightly pace. Even if it can be a tease, some moments on OvalDNA are downright welcoming: It's hard to think of anything from Oval since the legendary ""Do While"" as beautiful as ""Australasia"". One of the album's more compositionally complete tracks, it juggles jerkily plucked strings, organs that whir to life before being pulled apart into groaning rumbles, and drums that stutter across the stereo spectrum at random. That might sound like a mess, but the elements just slightly coalesce to form a stirring, heart-tugging refrain gently morphing over the track's three-and-a-half minutes, a chief example of the accidental alchemy of OvalDNA. ""Octaeder 0.2"", which formed the centerpiece to Oval's live contribution to the Henri Pousseur tribute 4 Parabolic Mixes, proves the emotional potential of these flurries of compressed ones and zeroes, while the more recent Oval material is at least coincidentally referenced with a number of tracks that make live-instrument samples their focus (""Credit Line""), stumbling on an odd hybrid of acoustic and computerized sounds in the process, like twang rendered with right angles. Approachability is one thing, and OvalDNA has it in spades, but there's also the issue of relevance: Can a veteran act in a largely outmoded genre still command attention with an outtakes collection? Certainly, any fan of Oval (particularly those lapsed after O) will find a lot to love in OvalDNA's gentle reassurances, but even for a newcomer, these sounds are idiosyncratic and stimulating enough to get lost in. OvalDNA is curiously timeless, as if these tracks were encased in amber, still holding that intriguingly alien gleam and shine as back in Oval's halcyon days, even polished up a little nicer this time. It might not be something we knew we still needed, but at the least, OvalDNA is a solid addition to the canon of one of the most innovative electronic acts of the 1990s.","This remarkably consistent, 25-track collection of bits and bytes from assorted past Oval eras flies by in an easygoing blur, rendering sounds in a fluid and volatile technicolor that's missing from even the project's classic records.

Alone III: The Pinkerton Years,Rivers Cuomo,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d59d034d5c69bf4c1e/1:1/w_160/6501ffe3.jpg,2012-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16152-alone-iii-the-pinkerton-years/,Geffen,"You'd think Alone III: The Pinkerton Years would work like Rivers Cuomo's past installments of vault clearance: In exchange for being offered these very #rare and #based freestyles, you, Weezer Superfan, will not do something so petty as to question the need for their release. Ah, but note the subtitle: ""The Pinkerton Years."" It's a powerful but potentially dangerous sales pitch. Alone III comes sidelong with The Pinkerton Diaries, a $75 (and thus collectors-only) volume that compiles Cuomo's ""journals, emails, letters, photos, and school papers"" from the Pinkerton era and offers ""an intimate look into the writing and recordings of Rivers Cuomo from 1994-1997."" Which threatens not only redundancy but a complete undermining of Pinkerton's integrity*.* ""I thought Pinkerton was Cuomo's diary,"" you might be thinking. ""He was holding back on us? Editing?"" Does this compromise the perceived purity of such a powerful record? Then again, Pinkerton has always been accompanied by a healthy serving of half-truths, tall tales, and revisionist history. But you can see why so many want to give it a protected status: Cuomo was far more embarrassed by its Billboard failure than anything he actually said on Pinkerton, and his output since then has been the work of someone with severe commercial abandonment issues. But Alone III doesn't feel like a cash-in like the Pinkerton reissue or 2010's Memories Tour, in which the band (minus bassist Matt Sharp) played their first two albums in full. No, this is something else entirely. With its whiplash sequencing (26 tracks in far less than an hour), low production values, minute-long asides, and pause-record tape overdubs, Alone III seems to ask: What would've happened if Rivers Cuomo had wanted to be Robert Pollard or Lou Barlow for the rest of the 90s? So if you value these archaeological digs as an opportunity to construct an alternate band history, Alone III is easily Cuomo's most worthwhile project since*,* well, Pinkerton. But what's truly surprising is that it satisfies in actuality as much as it does in theory, and not just because it puts a bunch of Pinkerton songs in the mix. Alone III actually deconstructs that record by spreading out into three sections, providing anchors for Cuomo's mini-suite ambitions rather than the lead-up to Pinkerton's autobiographical payoff (""Across the Sea"", ""The Good Life""). Fully formed but raw-as-hell versions of ""Getchoo"" and ""Tired of Sex"" mesh easily with Cuomo's off-the-cuff material and allow Alone III to exist in its own orbit as a no-fi, freewheeling, and ultimately fun record that either Geffen or Weezer wouldn't allow themselves to ever release in the midst of the record industry's then-booming economy. Even with the impression that Cuomo is dipping into his private stock, a lot of this will be familiar to non-diehards, like the two-minute surge of ""You Gave Your Love to Me Softly"" that leans to the latter side of ""pop-punk"" and could've replaced ""Why Bother?"" on Pinkerton with a 180-degree attitude change. And it's tough to imagine Weezer ever pulling off something like ""Lisa"". Its blues-bend Kiss riffs would've been employed too smirkingly, its charming chorus harmonies polished to anonymity, and its lyric about a workplace crush (""I wish I didn't work for you/ All we ever seem to do is business/ Read and sign and fax this"") extended beyond its means into dad-humor. So those are the reasons why III is the most like an actual Weezer album of any of the Alone records, and the least like a Cuomo yard sale. But the real pleasure is in how Alone III casts the creative up-ramp to Pinkerton as an inspired if not always productive time for Cuomo-- you can practically visualize his brain giddily whirring with a flood of new ideas and classicist ambitions. Sure, there are 50-second sketches that have limited replay value outside of Alone III, but they keep the end-to-end listen brisk and pleasurable. Elsewhere, some songs are so self-explanatory and complete that they don't need much elaboration (""I'm So Lonely on a Saturday Night""), others crash into a dead end (""Oh God, I'm Hungry"", ""The End of My String""), and of course, some are just flat out unlistenable (""What Is This I Find?""). In a Spin interview leading up to Pinkerton's re-release, Cuomo expressed why he enjoyed going back to these tapes even though he's far more excited by his new material, saying ""I was really touched by the emotion in my voice… there's so much sensitivity and pain."" Alone III's last track would seem to reiterate that: On ""One Glorious Moment"", Cuomo gives a post-operation captain's log, confiding to a tape recorder, ""I actually peed for the first time on my own… it was a glorious moment. I'm going to try to set up some music to listen to, goodbye."" That candor can be seen as being every bit as self-obsessed and pandering as Hurley or Death to False Metal, but that last line sticks out. Alone III is a bracing, imperfect reminder of a time when music was something Cuomo just couldn't live without.","Unlike the previous Alone iterations, Alone III: The Pinkerton Years feels like an actual Weezer album rather than Rivers Cuomo's yard sale. It's a bracing, imperfect reminder of a time when music was something Cuomo couldn't live without.

Black Cocaine EP,Mobb Deep,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a813d197565213a7ea/1:1/w_160/fe3e4ed7.jpeg,2012-01-11 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16117-black-cocaine-ep/,Infamous,"Does it devalue Mobb Deep's output from the 1990s if I think they could still possibly perform at that level despite over a decade's worth of evidence to the contrary? Let me clarify: I'm not talking so much about The Infamous or Hell on Earth, those would require reopening a window of commercial relevance for that rugged and raw aesthetic as well as Prodigy and Havoc reemerging as the fatalistic old souls of their early 20s, preferably rocking Hennessy football jerseys. That's probably not going to happen, and it's not entirely their fault. But they don't need any of that to aspire to the standards set by the still-awesome Murda Muzik, their 1999 LP which, in retrospect, could be seen as a forerunner to DipSet's synthesis of deadpan, absurdist violence, and a general disregard for actual rhyming. They just need to be entertaining and not give a fuck, and I mean-- have you seen Prodigy's Twitter feed since he got out of jail? But while @PRODIGYMOBBDEEP is more than capable of reminding us never to question his trendsetting nor what he brought to the table, very little of that batshit sense of purpose or fun makes it to Black Cocaine. The trouble isn't that Havoc and Prodigy have run out of things to say, or that they don't really have much to rap about anymore-- they're real, you're shook, and Prodigy will almost certainly have sex with your woman if only to make your bitch ass realize your own capability for being shook. That shit obviously never goes out of style, but rather than the likely legitimate insanity Prodigy flexed on 2007's Return of the Mac, the two wring inspiration from that mode with the stubbornness of trying to get that last bit of toothpaste out the tube. Once the author of the illest first lines (""Quiet Storm"", ""Shook Ones, Pt. II"", the list goes on), Prodigy hardly comes up with one memorable rhyme during the entirety of Black Cocaine-- we get brief teases at Illuminati P conspiracy theorizing, but little anyone who's seen a one dollar bill couldn't come up with. Likewise, Havoc delivers bar after bar of near-mesmeric placeholders, but he does boast about having ""a ledger on my MacBook,"" so now you know Excel is the spreadsheet of choice for dunn accountants. Still, at least they're not fronting like club attendees or sex symbols anymore, and any remnant of G-Unit factory production is swapped out for wheelhouse Mobb with plenty of synthesized horns and ice-grilled hi-hats. But the title track and ""Conquer"" just remind me of any number of Infamy deep cuts whose titles escape me and whose quality doesn't inspire me to find out. If nothing else, you can be happy that Alchemist is inevitably involved, and I seriously doubt anyone's still holding ""Takeover"" against them if Nas isn't. While it's a distinct pleasure to hear Queensbridge's finest reconcile their differences, it's a distinct disappointment all the same at the utter lack of spark present on ""Get It Forever"": Nastradamus is considered one of the least-inspired hip-hop records ever made, and even then, these guys could still come up with something as bracing and utterly badass as ""Family"". And you can also admire the stylistic window dressing as Hav and P try some kind of weird upper register flow on ""Dead Man Shoes"". But they never find their footing, while you can imagine Bounty Killa spending the pauses during his offbeat hook wondering whether Gwen Stefani still has his phone number. And so Black Cocaine comes across as not particularly different than, say, recent records from Saigon or Uncle Murda or M.O.P., guys who should be able to use the cratered rap economy to their advantage and create the rawest, most uncompromising, and NY-centric hardcore hip-hop they so choose, but who ultimately sound confused as to how to navigate a land with no boundaries. (Just bearing witness to ""Hell On Earth 2k11"" featuring French Montana and Waka Flocka Flame is kinda mindblowing either way.) Truth is, Mobb Deep sound kinda unsure as to where they stand, too proud to truly change up their style and still too much of a name brand to have to.","On Havoc and Prodigy's first recording since the latter's release from prison, Mobb Deep sound unsure where they stand, too proud to change their style and too much of a name brand to bother.

Escort,Escort,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e59d034d5c69bf4c3c/1:1/w_160/1f196f04.jpeg,2012-01-11 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16165-escort/,Escort,"The studio must be an oasis for Dan Balis and Eugene Cho, the leaders of Escort, New York's premier live disco ensemble. Do you have any idea how hard it is to play this stuff in a club without coming off like rank amateurs or soulless professionals? You have to be tighter-than-tight to replicate those metronomic rhythms, while also being loose enough to play through any in-the-moment human glitches. You can't wrong-foot dancers, but you also can't be so precision-tooled that you lose the sense of abandon that's essential to any good party. You're not competing with a drum machine, which is tough enough to do. You're competing with Nile Rodgers' Chic, a much more forbidding proposition. In the safety of a recording booth, a band like Escort is allowed to flub multiple takes, correct any mistakes, and experiment without worrying about bringing the party down from its boil. They can tinker with their lush arrangements until they fit with the jigsaw-precision that was required of disco bands in the genre's pre-computer heyday. Escort is the result of all that fieriness and fine-tuning, the band's debut album after a drawn-out series of singles, teasing fans for more than half a decade. On the evidence, Balis and Cho are two producers who've listened long and hard to the history of their favorite genre, and who care about getting both the little details and the overall Broadway-meets-boogie vibe just right. They manage to replicate every Off the Wall horn blast and Patrick Cowley synth bubble with loving music geek precision. But Escort isn't just the pinnacle of 21st-century disco fetishism. (Though it would be a singular achievement even if it were.) It's a great pop album, even if it's working off 1979's pop template rather than 2011's. Balis and Cho aren't quite up to Chic's level, obviously, as songwriters or players. But they've set themselves a similar task, out to prove that refinement and abandon aren't mutually exclusive. Like disco the first time around, Escort aims directly for the brain's pleasure centers, particularly the one marked ""bubblefunk,"" but there's also an intensity and attention to sound design that comes from being both an in-the-moment live unit and studio rat tinkerers. All this astounding detail work is there to add extra thrills to songs that are instantly accessible, immediately charming. Rather than 12""-friendly extended disco remixes, these cuts are shaved down to the essentials. And the grooves would be strong enough with half the bells and whistles. Escort just want you to have a damned good time, even if you don't know Walter Gibbons from KC and the Sunshine Band. And they're willing to risk all sorts of cheesiness to get you there. So it's no accident that ""A Sailboat in the Moonlight"" seamlessly switches halfway thorough, from hammy musical theater to lascivious funk. The ""mutant disco"" scene and the pre-crossover Loft underground cuts may be the pieces of the disco pie most palatable to indie-reared ears. But Escort remind revisionist critics that disco also had roots in supper-club schmaltz, showbizzy soul, and Las Vegas pomp. If there's a guiding spirit here, it's not benevolent weirdo Arthur Russell but master entertainer August Darnell at his most eager to please. The rhythm track on ""All Through the Night"" has the kind of crisp minimalism you find on the best DFA singles. But the rapid-fire R&B sassiness of the vocal takes us straight to the roller rink on teen night. Sure, it wouldn't play at a roller rink now, competing with the brutalism of 2011's pop-dance producers, but Balis and Cho's hearts are in the right populist place. Escort take obvious pains that this update on one of pop's most opulently orchestrated of genres can stand, sonically, alongside the classics. Those strings! Even if they had the money, modern major labels still wouldn't lavish that much attention on recording a string section. And if that old-school analog lushness is computer fakery, then I'm doubly impressed. But given Escort's rep for throwing down live, I doubt it. It's easy enough to press a button and unleash a sampled swirl of strings or a blast of brass. It's something else entirely to be orchestrating violinists and trumpet players through a seven-minute monster groove. That kind of commitment is one reason Escort have ascended to the top ranks of neo-disco acts, swinging their way through the demands of disco with the consummate skill of the kind of crack big bands that were everywhere in the late 1970s.","The New York live disco ensemble's self-titled debut is not just the pinnacle of 21st-century disco fetishism, it's a great pop record, even if it's working off 1979's pop template rather than 2011's.

Shadows EP,Floating Points,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d7ea9e61561daa69c0/1:1/w_160/ef1ffffa.jpeg,2012-01-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16154-shadows/,Eglo,"Versatility is tricky. Unless you're a legit polymath, it's as easy to spread yourself thin as it is to create compelling work across several spectra. Polymath may still be in play for Sam Shepherd: In addition to his work as Floating Points, he's a classically trained musician, (outré-)jazz enthusiast and bandleader, an in-demand DJ, and a PhD candidate in molecular genetics. He is the brainy, footloose heir to Four Tet's wild-eyed beatsmith throne (London seat). In addition to his range, it's tempting to let these activities tell us something else about Shepherd: They all point toward studious refinement. Shadows, a 2x12"" nearing 40 minutes in length, suggests that Shepherd continues to filter his approach to rhythm and melody. To date Shepherd's varying output has bordered on the maximal. The Vacuum EP-- still one of the finest slabs of vinyl to emerge from a London scene that also gave birth to James Blake, Joy O, and Night Slugs-- found him painting outside the lines of house and bass music, spreading squelchy melodies that owed more to hippie jazz than club music. Since then he's remained sneakily busy, releasing a handful of tracks that sound generally brighter and more musical than those of his peers. In contrast, when ""Sais (Dub)"" dropped on Record Store Day last year, it sounded as if someone had jammed a mute into his trumpet: The track's smoky symphony of bass and beats barely hinted at his ever-present jazz melodies (an even more modest edit of ""Sais"" closes Shadows). A less generous reader of Shadows might skip ""refinement"" altogether and arrive at ""retreat."" The record-- which represents the longest, most cohesive release Shepherd has offered-- sounds polite at low volumes (at most volumes, actually), and I wouldn't blame anyone for mistaking it for a headphone record. But Shadows benefits from volume; open air and clean walls amplify its details. Over the course of five long, progressive tracks, Shepherd offers a series of minor orchestrations, layering tasteful slabs of jazz (I'm assuming they're samples) over a dense crosshatch of bass and drum sequences. There are extended passages during which he offers little more than drum patterns at competing frequencies; ""Obfuse"" looms for more than three minutes before it hints at true melody. Elsewhere Shepherd is more forward. ""ARP3"" piles tasteful electronic keyboard over a sinister bassline that alternates between five and seven notes of passive evil. Any (sonic) ties Shepherd still has to London's bass scene can be seen in moments like ""ARP3"" and the distended fog of ""Realise"", during which he hijacks deep house's stoned haze and poisons it, however slyly. That he can perform such misdeeds and still come across as elegant, musical, and inspired speaks to a talent that was never really in doubt.","This elegant 2x12""-- Sam Shepherd's longest, most cohesive release to date-- suggests the London producer, DJ, and composer is continuing to filter his approach to rhythm and melody.

Henge Beat,Total Control,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c413d197565213a81a/1:1/w_160/2adb7c5c.jpeg,2012-01-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16143-henge-beat/,Iron Lung,"For the most part, ""supergroup"" is a relative term. It's a descriptor that itself holds a load of other nebulous, subjective ideas, such as ""success,"" ""relevance,"" and the notion of a ""primary band."" But with musicians-- especially nowadays-- being prone to enlist in three or four groups at a time, devoting a fairly even amount of attention to all of them, is there any way to logically keep track of which bands are bands and which bands are side-projects or supergroups? Total Control are as close to a supergroup as a tandem of cult Australian punks can get. Each member is involved in another band, the most well-known of which being guitarist Mikey Young's Eddy Current Suppression Ring-- which, if you only have a passing knowledge of current garage-rock, can elicit the same sort of confused blank stare as if you told someone your band's most famous member also plays in the Growlers. Thankfully, when mild obscurity is on a group's side, they are allowed few expectations to conquer and the chance to legitimately surprise people. But even if you're intimately familiar with Eddy Current Suppression Ring, UV Race, Straightjacket Nation, and the Collapse, Henge Beat is startlingly good; good enough to surpass even the top-shelf efforts from the members' other bands. As you might expect from a band named after a six-minute Motels single, Total Control possess a rich knowledge of a very specific point in music history. Though bearing no resemblance to the song in which they've derived their name, most of their key influences were very much active in 1979, the year the single was released. Opener ""See More Glass"" is indebted to Suicide's second self-titled album. Shades of late-period Roxy Music can be found in closer ""Love Performance"". Wire, the Buzzcocks, Joy Division, and Swell Maps all slow up in the strands of Total Control's DNA. But if Henge Beat were simply a 36-minute post-punk genre exercise, it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining. The band explores a different realm of possibilities in every song, punctuating creeping lurches with ear-splitting explosions and delivering spacey instrumentals not incredibly far removed from elevator music right after. ""The Hammer"" is eerie, black-clad darkwave. ""Shame Thugs"" sounds like alternate title screen music for beloved Super Nintendo RPG EarthBound. ""No Bibs"" comes off like SST hardcore thrown into vertigo. (If you have an older sibling that grew up in the 1980s and passed you all of their coolest punk records when they went off to college, give them a copy of Henge Beat and they may shed actual tears of joy.) As if the ultra-cohesive fusion of punk music's fruitful first decade wasn't enough, Dan Stewart (Straightjacket Nation) makes for a compelling frontman, a lyricist weaned on Salinger and Philip K. Dick whose vocal range stays in the pocket but exhibits a great deal of versatility regardless. His taste in literature proves that he knows the value of a good narrator: The greedy factory owner in ""Retiree"" barks, ""keep them at work,"" in an icy, robotic tone while looking at a gold watch ticking down the days. ""Meds II"" captures the redundancy of self-medicated culture-- through methods both legal and otherwise-- with the lyric, ""Taking pills to remember to take pills to forget."" ""Love Performance"" can sound glittery and optimistic due to its blinking neon synths and ""these are not the last days"" refrain, but it's actually a rumination on our fantasies of being eulogized (""In the last days, they'll sing your praise""), finding Stewart pitching rocks at the celebratory stance of the supposedly righteous whenever they think the world's number is being called (think Y2k, the rapture, the end of the Mayan calendar). Album centerpiece ""Carpet Rash"" finds Stewart at his most detached vocally while crafting an array of evocative imagery (""Drinking detergent and licking the walls/ Eating your breakfast in shower stalls""), writing a song that fully embodies how desperate, unfulfilling, and hopeless sex can sometimes be. Throughout the entirety of Henge Beat, there is a sharp fluidity in all of its elements, from the interplay of the band's members to its lyrical concepts. In spite of being primarily described as a composite of members from other groups, Total Control display the kind of unity that veteran bands take years to cultivate. They make you realize that a lot of the best ""supergroups"" are merely regular old groups with members noteworthy for being excellent at what they do.","Featuring Mikey Young of Eddy Current Suppression Ring, among others, Total Control is as close to a supergroup as a tandem of cult Australian punks can get. Surprisingly, their debut LP surpasses even the top-shelf efforts from their other bands.

Live at the Paramount,Nirvana,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e35e6ef95969322385/1:1/w_160/b31365d3.jpg,2012-01-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16162-nirvana-live-at-the-paramount/,Geffen,"One month after Nirvana released Nevermind, they performed a gig at Seattle's Paramount Theatre on Halloween. A week after the show, Nevermind would crack the Top 40. A month later, it would be certified Gold. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was climbing to alarming heights on the Billboard chart. There was an imposing phalanx of video cameras present at the venue, to capture the gig in its entirety. The band was, understandably, a little freaked. There is plenty of live Nirvana already available to us: the half-hearted-feeling rush job that was From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah in 1996; the commercial release, last year, of the beloved bootleg Live at Reading; the Unplugged record. But the joy of Live at the Paramount is hearing the charge of this moment: a great band newly famous, still reeling and flooded with nervy adrenaline. Every single song on this setlist has already been featured once, or more, on some other Nirvana live record. But it's still invaluable. Kurt's voice sounds remarkably powerful here: He sang in a way that was obviously unsustainable, even with the aid of heavy cough syrup, and there's a thrill, although a slightly selfish one, of hearing his voice rip the air before he had begun to scream it down to the threads. His peculiar, yowling phrasing may have been a deliberate choice, or it might have been the only way he managed to wrangle those notes from a constricted voice box, but there is a terrible, riveting intensity to it: Words feel torn from him, bearing fishhooks on their way out. ""Aneurysm""'s ""Love you so much/ It makes me sick"" becomes ""Laahve yeww sowl much et makes me SECK."" It physically hurts to hear, as it always has, but it gives you some of the most committed, clear performances of Nirvana's canonical songs as you're likely to get. There is some time-capsule fun to have listening to Paramount-- one of the biggest cheers is for ""School""! Krist Novoselic makes a wince-inducing ""Smile, you're on 'Candid Camera'"" joke! But the album's queerest, and most fascinating, punk-rock sociological moment comes from the protracted lead-up to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", which was already the elephant in the room. You can practically see the feet-dragging and hand-twisting that leads up to it, like antsy kids being herded into Sunday service. First, Novoselic makes some noncommittal crack about the absence of Halloween constumes in the crowd (""unless you're all supposed to be punk rockers."") Then they play ""Floyd the Barber"", one of the least melodic and sludgiest songs in the catalog. Afterward, a time-killing little tongue-in-cheek instrumental jam. Then, Novoselic's voice cuts back into the mic, as he hollers, curiously, ""White boy funk sucks!"" Only after all this fidgeting is finished do those chords fire up. In the moment you can hear roaring to life the enormous machine that would, less than a year later, take Nevermind to multi-platinum status. The version is anything but noncommittal-- Cobain leans into every ""a denial"" harder than the last. It's exhilarating and poignant. You can hear they still unambiguously love this song, even if it was starting to make things complicated for them.","One month after Nirvana released Nevermind, they performed at Seattle's Paramount Theatre on Halloween. The joy of Live at the Paramount is hearing the charge of this moment: a great band newly famous, still reeling and flooded with nervy adrenaline.

Vienna Blue,Tin Man,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d99d034d5c69bf4c27/1:1/w_160/3f14682a.jpeg,2012-01-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16155-vienna-blue/,self-released,"If you don't know Tin Man-- California-hailing, Vienna-based Johannes Auvinen-- he's arguably one of modern techno's most cultish figures, with a distinct sense of fashion and aestheticism both visually and aurally. But is he really techno? He made his initial fame off the back of a bunch of fabulous acid 12""s, but he's always had a darker, more experimental side, and since 2009's Cool Wave has been incorporating an introverted and dignified half-goth, half-baroque pop sensibility to his productions. Scared from 2010 was even less hospitable, all spooky atmospheres and post-punk vocals, and last year's follow-up, Perfume, brought back some of the techno-friendly snares and kicks but still centered around Auvinen's offbeat, sometimes off-key baritone. For the most part, it wasn't dance music. But last year also saw the release of the ""Nonneo"" 12"", one of the year's most cherished techno missives, a gently bubbling acid bath. As 2011 wrapped to a close, Auvinen released another album, this one completely free of charge: but which Tin Man would we get, the weirdo dance auteur of ""Constant Confusion"" fame or something closer to Scared? The answer is neither. Inspired by his adopted home of Vienna, Vienna Blue is a gentle chamber-pop record not like much else Auvinen has put to his name before. Real chamber stuff, with cellos and violins overshadowing most of the synthesized elements. Auvinen calls it a ""winter album,"" and the label fits: All cool hues of icy blue and white, Vienna Blue inhabits a chilly but cozy place that suits stereotypically romantic images of the Austrian capital draped in snow. It's not totally foreign; just as Perfume and Scared shyly hinted at techno elements and structures, the music on Vienna Blue shares that forward-thinking lateral movement, only this time expressed with the gentle strokes and plucks of strings, graceful rather than tracky. What can make Tin Man's music a little divisive-- what makes his albums difficult where his singles can be relatively smooth sailing-- is his own voice. Like a slurred and slovenly Stephin Merritt, he shares that singer's idiosyncratic sense of cultured class, but the cavernous space his vocals inhabit can be alienating and his melodies often feel makeshift or improvised. With the more tuneful accompaniment on Vienna Blue, however, his presence is less jarring: When his voice dips down to those dangerously low notes, it blends in with the bass instruments instead of billowing out into an uncomfortably empty echo chamber. ""Music on the Radio"" might be his best vocal track yet, in fact, with dramatic pianos and a laborious kick drum finding some happy medium between classically tinged instrumentation and techno. It's moments like this that raise Vienna Blue above side-project gimmickry: ""Ice Blue Eyes"" pulses faintly with a barely there beat, like it's impossible to tell what's ""real"" and what's artificial. Throw in Auvinen's groggy vocals, and you've got yourself a gorgeous lullaby of flickering, half-present sounds. Vienna Blue is split between longer, more structured vocal tracks and instrumental interludes, which range from string-led motifs (""Winterize"" is especially majestic) to near-ambient mood pieces (""Ok, Improvise""). This lazily lapping flow nicely cuts up the length of the rather slow-moving record, but can just as easily render it drifting and aimless. The real-life instruments lend it a natural quality like sonic wallpaper that subtly blooms and and swells, but Vienna Blue lacks even the sparse momentum of his previous albums. The pleasantly slow creep of it all is rudely interrupted by the vocal tracks, and those times when the vocals don't quite mesh with their surroundings (""Gratitude"") prove rather garish cracks in the record's otherwise uniformly glassy ice surface. As a whole, Vienna Blue is always caught between classicist ideas of the stately and that deeply experimental techno bent, so it never quite coheres. One thing Vienna Blue does make clear is Auvinen's uncompromising vision of his own style, folding in all sorts of latent impulses and confident to the point of confrontational. He remains defiantly independent from scene or context: Just as unfairly limiting as it is to call this chamber pop, it's equally ignorant to call it techno. ""Rockers, ravers, you best beware. This generation don't care,"" he sang on Perfume's ""Rockers Ravers"", and Vienna Blue caps off Tin Man's most intriguing year yet, proving he really doesn't give a damn about genre. It might not be perfect, but ""chamber techno"" probably shouldn't work as well as it does on the best moments here: Leave it to someone as effortlessly suave and fearless as Tin Man to try and pull it off.","Johannes Auvinen's final offering of 2011 is an icy free-of-charge chamber pop record unlike anything the Vienna-based techno auteur has previously released.

Items,Household,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d6b1335d7bf169a4cd/1:1/w_160/52be75bb.jpeg,2012-01-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16153-household-items/,Dull Knife,"There's not much information out there about Brooklyn trio Household or their debut Items, but even if there was, it wouldn't be easy to find. When I first heard the infectious, spring-loaded ""Go Away"", I naively typed ""Household Items"" into Google. What I found was, of course, not information about the record but instead some kind of timeless commentary on domestic boredom: top results included ""household items to masturbate with,"" ""household items to make a bong out of,"" and-- why not cut out the middleman-- ""household items that will get you high."" A few more precise keywords (""Brooklyn,"" ""Young Marble Giants-influenced,"" ""guitars that sound like they've been strung with rubber bands"") led me to the record on their Bandcamp, but once I got listening I realized that Google, in its sly wisdom, might have had it right the first time. Items is an ode to domestic boredom, romantic dissatisfaction, and the emotional detachment that results from feeling imprisoned within routine. The most immediately refreshing thing about Household is that-- in a moment when most melodic punk comes with an obligatorily caked-on layer of distortion-- Items sounds cleaner than a Stepford Wife's countertop. Jenna Weiss-Berman's spartan percussion, Isabel Freeman's bouncing basslines, and Talya Cooper's pristine riffs interlock with utility and precision. Like Austin duo Yellow Fever and San Francisco's Grass Widow, Household specialize in minimalist, retro-tinged post-punk that's as indebted to indie pop as it is to Wire. But the wry attitude of Cooper and Weiss-Berman's vocals recall nobody so much as the patron saint of new wave sardonicism, Waitresses frontwoman Patty Donahue. Listen close and you'll swear you can hear their eyeballs rolling all through the minute-long sass-fest ""Never After"". ""No-o/ Don't call me/ I'll call you,"" Cooper promises. Yeah, right. ""I always write these 'not-angry-just-disappointed lyrics,'"" Cooper said in a recent interview, and there's a fitting sense of restraint, repression, and even passive-aggressiveness that emerges from these tunes. ""Cold Hands"" paints a portrait of a love affair in shades of dull, passionless gray (""Your laundry is folded and your dinner is made/ Your window shows cars and people, they all look the same"") while the sarcastically titled ""Our Song"", laden with Cooper and Weiss-Berman's off-kilter harmonies, laments, ""This is how we spend our days/ Nothing ventured, nothing gained."" Because the record's so thematically dour, Household are at their best when they kick up the tempo. ""Go Away"" turns a song about an emotionally unavailable lover into a briefly cathartic pogo jam: Cooper and Weiss-Berman's disparate vocal melodies braid in and out before combining into a minimalist's take on the anthemic chorus. ""Defective!/ Defective!"" they shout, and it comes off like a death sentence for a relationship that sounds about as steamy as a broken microwave. Items doesn't show much range, but at a taut 18 minutes, it's over before its one note runs its course. Still, with all this talk of drudgery and weariness, you're right to ask: What keeps an album about boredom from being excruciatingly boring? In Household's case, it's their grasp on melody (the songs are catchy and simple without sounding too sing-songy) and their savvy terseness (another band might stretch a song like ""Never After"" past the minute mark, but it wouldn't have as much bite). The sole song to break the three-minute barrier is the finale, ""Cold Hands"", which also contains the only moment when that tightly contained passive aggression simmers to a boil. The track ends with Weiss-Berman raising her voice: As she repeats her initially mild-mannered refrain-- ""You've got the coldest hands anyway""-- it suddenly builds into a shout.

Bobby Charles,Bobby Charles,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a6b1335d7bf169a483/1:1/w_160/466833e4.jpeg,2012-01-10 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16118-bobby-charles/,Rhino Handmade,"On the third disc of this wood-paneled box set of Louisiana singer Robert ""Bobby"" Charles Guidry's lone album from the 1970s, there's a half-hour interview with radio disc jockey Barry Hansen, better known as Dr. Demento. They laundry-list the records released that week in 1972, ranging from a posthumous Jimi Hendrix LP to John Fahey, Tim Buckley, Bonnie Raitt, Nazareth, Wet Willie, and Martin Mull. To which Bobby Charles comments in his gentle, stoned Cajun drawl: ""It's too bad, a lot of good ones just have to get lost. It's unexplainable, but they just do."" To which Hansen replies: ""Well... a lot of times they get picked up the second or third time around."" Warm and crackling as a campfire, easeful and understated, all of it suffused with Charles' nuanced blend of humor and empathy, this 1972 eponymous album was one of the ""good ones"" that got lost. Think of this as the second or third time around for the album to finally find its people-- and there should be plenty of them. Considering that 4/5ths of the Band served as Charles' back up group here (augmented by Dr. John and Neil Young pedal steel guitarist Ben E. Keith), this is-- simply put-- one of the most sublime Americana records ever cut. Charles' story started two decades earlier, when he wrote and recorded R&B standards like ""See You Later, Alligator"" and ""Walking to New Orleans"". The story goes that Chess Records signed the then-14-year-old sight unseen after he sang them ""Alligator"" over the phone. When he arrived in their Chicago offices, though, Leonard Chess flipped out: Not because Charles was underage, but because he was white. After touring through a pre-integration South, he wound up in Nashville by the late 1960s. A marijuana rap led him to head further north, where he ultimately fell in with the musical community centered around Woodstock, N.Y., recording at Dylan manager Albert Grossman's Bearsville Studios. From the opening twang and snare snap of ""Street People"", it's clear Charles' songwriting acumen had grown beyond his early R&B roots. Over the slinking beat, he details an itinerant life of what one would label a ""bum."" But rather than spin some tale of hard luck and woe, Charles makes drifting from town to town and panhandling for spare change sound idyllic. ""Wouldn't trade places with no one I know/ I'm happy with where I'm at,"" he drawls. A cowbell accents the punchline: ""Some people would rather work/ We need people like that."" Elsewhere, there are organ-gurgling numbers about new love and community gossip, lilting ballads about watching butterflies, honking barroom numbers about growing old, and gentle, country-tinged numbers about spending all day in bed with your honey. And then there's the ode to Jesus to save him from his followers. All of it gets delivered with a sly grin and at a pace with which you might sip a beer on a back porch, cast a fishing line into a creek, or barbecue a rack of ribs: slow, unhurried, a sunny afternoon ahead of you. Some 25 previously unreleased tracks augment the original 10-song album, ranging from the pleasant to revelatory. There are differently mixed singles, three songs released only on a Japanese box set, some half-baked songs, but also the sound of Charles' shuffling toward a follow-up album that he never quite got around to finishing. Or, as he put his M.O. on one chorus: ""(I'm) staying stoned and singing homemade songs."" There's the Band's telltale funk on ""Why Are People Like That?"", Dr. John's piano commingling with Garth Hudson's gospel organ swells on the elegant crest of ""You Came Along"". Fans of Will Oldham's Arise Therefore will swoon for demos of Charles dueting with the Band's Rick Danko over a sputtering drum machine. When this set was originally made available through Rhino Handmade back in August (it's in stores now via distribution partner Light in the Attic), mid-album track ""He's Got All the Whiskey"" was already an album highlight. So it's uncanny hearing both it and ""Street People"" in a post-Occupy mindset. About as loud as ""Chappelle's Show""'s intro, Dixieland horns, Danko's bass, and a snare's pop skitter about as Charles gripes: ""He got all the money."" It, of course, follows that ""The Man"" also has all the ""whiskey/ power/ women,"" the biggest crime of it being that ""he won't give me none."" It's a simple protest from Bobby Charles-- good-natured at its heart-- and hopefully it won't get ignored this time around.","Reissued here as a wood-paneled box set with 25 bonus tracks, Louisiana singer Robert Charles' lone album from the 1970s, featuring four members of the Band as his backup group, is one of the most sublime Americana records ever cut.

Elemental Parts 1 & 2,Demdike Stare,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2de9d034d5c69bf4c30/1:1/w_160/0e7fcdd1.jpeg,2012-01-10 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16163-elemental-parts-1-2/,Modern Love,"The British duo Demdike Stare continue grimly spelunking through a dank, anxious netherworld on Elemental, their first new music in over a year. Their sound hasn't changed significantly in the interim: Dark, ambient drones tangle with scraps of post-punk and library music, while strains of dubstep and techno settle like pathogens in the bloodstream. If ""dark"" was the organizing principle of their last album, as Mike Powell said of Tryptych, then ""darker"" is their current M.O.-- murkier, more oppressive, and more intense. Suffused in cavernous reverb and distortion, Demdike Stare's hammered pianos and grinding, stunted rhythms conjure a kind of post-apocalyptic hellscape. Samples of exotic drums and unfamiliar string instruments are pitched so low that the waveforms seem to fray about the edges. Whatever doesn't decompose is thrown into shuddering, mechanical motion; I'm left with the image of giant machines tilling toxic soil, spitting up shrapnel from battles long lost and forgotten. Almost uniformly slow, sooty, and diffuse, the record can be disorienting; the more you listen, the more individual tracks blur together. Barring a few elegiac passages, there are few melodies to latch on to, and the record's structure feels almost labyrinthine. Tracks may meander through several distinct phases with little regard for a conventional narrative arc; some simply hover, digging in like a bad trip, until they break in a burst of chorus. Elements flit in and out of earshot according to inscrutable whim, and scattered lock grooves have the potential to fuck up your whole sense of time: I spent 10 minutes lost in a loop before I realized I needed to pick up the needle. There are pieces of recognizable musical codes scattered throughout-- twanging strings lifted from dusty Ocora samplers, techno's steady kick drum, the uneasy rumble of Nurse With Wound and SPK. Ragged synthesizers strafe across the spectrum like strobe lights in a British field, ca. 1989. In its more harmonic passages, the record's trapped-in-a-submarine atmosphere sounds directly inspired by Seefeel's great 1995 album Succour. The hand-soldered experiments of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop bubble up in squealing sine waves and erratic oscillations; those analog strokes are some of the freest sounds on the record, suggesting lines of flight up and away from a potter's field strewn with mouldering recordings of yore. Two songs explicitly engage with current modes of club music: ""Mnemosyne"" follows Shackleton's experiments in fourth world dubstep, with ululations laid over square-wave bass blurts and cracking snares, while ""Ishmael's Intent"" taps into the ominous, ethno-techno vibe of William Bennett's Cut Hands project. There's a lot of this kind of thing around at the moment-- in addition to Cut Hands, this particular field of gloomy, ethno-infected, post-industrial techno includes Demdike Stare's label-mates Andy Stott, G.H., Raime, and the rest of the Blackest Ever Black label, Ancient Methods, Ekoplekz, and the clockwork kalimba meltdowns of Harmonious Thelonious and the Durian Brothers-- and it's legitimate to ask what elevates Elemental above mere mannerism or fashion. (Now that Tiësto's peddling triangle t-shirts, we can probably agree that the isosceles' hipster moment is over, but the current fascination with esoteric, sepulchral music and imagery shows little sign of abating.) Beyond the pervasive sense of doom, which is only reinforced by titles like ""Mephisto's Lament"" and ""In the Wake of Chronos"", the whole album package feels like a tribute to limited-edition fetish products of 1980s industrial music. While a 2xCD reissue featuring an altered tracklisting is due later in the year, the album is currently out as a lavish, quadruple-gatefold, 4xLP set, with the individual discs colored four different shades of purple: chrysanthemum, violet, rose, and iris. (The first two pieces were included with the gatefold cover, now sold out; the second will be available for purchase separately. It's blatant collector bait, but it's hard to deny that it's a stunning piece of work.) The music itself, though, is plenty compelling all on its own. More focused than Tryptych, Elemental hones in on its mood and conveys a genuine sense of mystery that goes way beyond mere affect. Part of it, I think, has to do with the fact that you never know quite what you're hearing. Is that a foghorn or a Moog? A chorus of reeds or a bees' nest? Where did those drums come from? Does it matter? The sound lingers in between the representational and the abstract, and that ambiguity-- that impurity-- only increases its expressive dimensions. At several points, Demdike Stare's album sounds uncannily like Chris Watson's recently released El Tren Fantasma, a sound portrait of a Mexican railway in its last month of operation. Blurring the lines between documentary, music, and noise, and between life and technology, Watson's chronicle turned the real phantasmal. Demdike Stare do the opposite, conjuring a vivid fantasy world out of audio salvage and crusty circuitry.","On this 4xLP set-- soon to be reissued as a 2xCD-- the British duo continue spelunking through a dank netherworld. More focused than 2010's Tryptych, Elemental conveys a sense of mystery that goes beyond affect.

The Dreamer/The Believer,Common,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2dcea9e61561daa69ca/1:1/w_160/67a7dfb8.jpeg,2012-01-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16156-common-the-dreamerthe-believer/,Warner Bros.Think Common,"Common is confused, and who can blame him? His career has stumbled in so many directions that confusion is kind of unavoidable. He's gone from being a troubled, semi-alcoholic underground rapper, to a knit-cap, Soulquarian prince, to Kanye West's older, less-cool cousin, to now, just a friendly-looking guy who occasionally appears in Gap ads. At this point, it's anyone's guess who the ""Common"" on Common's records might be. The confusion reached its low point on 2008's Universal Mind Control, in which we were introduced the mortifying sight of strip-club Common. Now, The Dreamer/The Believer finds him banging his chest, demanding to know when hip-hop got all soft and sweet, and attempting to engage Drake in a war on wax. It's a bewildering spectacle, but a painful midlife crisis can cut two ways: In one corner, yes, we have the guy responsible for a song called ""Electric Wire Hustle Flower"" demanding machismo credentials from the former star of Degrassi: The Next Generation. But in the other, we have the best, hardest-hitting, and most consistent Common album since Be. In fact, The Dreamer/The Believer occasionally recalls the rough humanity and humble thoughtfulness of his still-untouchable mid-90s classics Resurrection and One Day It'll All Make Sense. It's hard to know where this guy still draws his creative fire from, but there are points on this record where Common raps as if his gift for slick embedded wordplay and tactile storytelling was just in a pocket he hadn't looked in for 10 years. Much of the album's fuel comes from soul-rap veteran No I.D., who handles the majority of the production. The Chicago producer has undergone a startling creative renaissance in the last two years: Until about 2009 he seemed destined to live out his life as local legend, the Godfather of Chicago Rap and the Guy Who Taught Kanye West. Lately, though, he's become what DJ Premier used to be: the guy you hire when you want to cozy up to Unimpeachable Authenticity. Even better, his latest work hits harder and more viciously than anything he's done before. ""Ghetto Dreams"", featuring a fully awake Nas, is the gulliest track Common has rapped on since ""The Corner"". ""Blue Sky"" chops up ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" into a looping, affecting plea. ""Celebrate"" is the best G.O.O.D. Music BBQ-jam since Kanye's ""See Me Now"". And the back-firing-Hooptee snare kick on ""Sweet"" almost lets you peek through your fingers as Common rails against ""hoe-ass"" rappers and informs us that he is ""to hip-hop what Obama is to politics."" Common raps so hard on The Dreamer that you can almost hear his neck veins throb. And for every bit of overcompensation-- he actually cracks a bottle over a dude's head in ""Raw""-- there's something vividly rendered and honest. That kind of honesty used to be Common's territory, but he surrendered it long ago to smarminess: by Finding Forever, he only seemed capable of rapping in fortune cookies. On ""Gold"", he paints fond memories of his early nights: ""Hats from liquor stores, to avoid syphilis/ Frivolous spending/ Drunk nights with storybook endings."" ""Lovin' I Lost"" is disarmingly humble and open-hearted about heartbreak: ""I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest."" Of course, there's still nothing worse than a Latter-Day Common Simile, and goofy lyrics abound. But the reason The Dreamer/The Believer sticks-- and it does-- isn't because Common reclaims some musty real-dude credentials he never had: It's because something seems to have reminded him that he's not a persona, but a real, blood-pumping human.","Common bounces back from the low point of his career with his best album since 2005's Be. Produced by soul-rap veteran No I.D. and featuring Nas, Maya Angelou, and John Legend, The Dreamer/The Believer has moments that recall the humanity and thoughtfulness of his mid-90s classics.

Glimmer,Jacaszek,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d3b1335d7bf169a4c8/1:1/w_160/4f5ee0e4.jpeg,2012-01-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16150-glimmer/,Ghostly,"In a December review for Wire, British critic Joe Muggs explored the way Berlin producer Anstam uses technology to emulate acoustic instruments-- and then, push those sounds to places that actual players in an orchestra could never go. Muggs invokes the concepts of ""uncanny valley"" and ""trompe l'oreille,"" related phrases describing the phenomenon of fabricated artifacts and intelligences mimicking ""real life"" to the point of being indistinguishable. ""The dividing line between the physical and digital worlds is fast fading away,"" Muggs writes in a prelude of praise for Anstam's Dispel Dances, ""in the process posing new questions about our relationship to what we’re hearing."" Most of Muggs' fascination with Anstam appropriately stems from a sense of wonder, or imagining the possibilities of a set of computers refined enough to make digital music sound as though it were recorded in a studio but play music beyond the capabilities of human hands. It's a post-milliennial update of Conlon Nancarrow's player-piano rolls, where the human becomes the controller, if not the hands-on creator. Glimmer, the new album by Polish producer Michał Jacaszek, takes a much different path to a very similar sort of intrigue. Jacaszek has long operated at artistic thresholds. His 2009 album, Pentral, for instance, seemed like an attempt to be as brutal and beautiful as possible. Without notice, he'd burst from near-silent calm into speaker-splitting tones. If that sounds off-putting, Pentral thankfully played more like an attempt to dismiss a binary than to bait and cruelly switch. For Glimmer, Jacaszek combines a real-time ensemble-- here, harpsichordist Małgosia Skotnicka, clarinetist Andrzej Wojciechowski, and himself on acoustic guitar and metallophone-- with his own web of electroacoustic effects. Jacaszek possesses the soft programming touch of Christian Fennesz. Sensitive and slight, his electronics suggest a layer of lace sitting softly above patches of sculpted debris. As a composer with this small group, Jacaszek recalls recent romantics like Texas' excellent Balmorhea and Sweden's delicate Tape; the music is often pretty but not cloyingly so, meaning that there's space for foreboding and worry between the oboe's lifts and the harpsichord's fanciest runs. Rather than simply process previously recorded sounds, he smartly trusses those qualities, shaping an album that feels like some science-fiction waking dream. In an atmosphere that's very pleasant but vaguely eerie, the humans and the robots interact, each occasionally slipping behind the cover of the other. Jacaszek's again craftily corroded another binary. Glimmer's nine tracks work best as a whole, built with hard-won peaks and long-sloped valleys that disappear into the distance. As the album progresses, Jacaszek hints at previous themes and ideas, using a classical trope to earn a sense of cohesion. It works, too, making the 41 minutes between the repetition that opens ""Goldengrove"" and the granulated whirr that signals the exit of ""Windhover"" seem compulsory. But there are remix-ready instrumentals here, too, from the Burial-like stasis of the gorgeous ""Dare-Gale"" to the swollen majesty at the center of ""As Each Tucked String Tells"". Think of Glimmer as a little symphony, just with singles, and made by a musician who can't decide between the roles of producer or composer. Really, he shouldn't anytime soon.","Think of the new album by Polish electroacoustic producer Michał Jacaszek as a symphony, just with singles, and made by a musician who can't decide between the roles of producer or composer.

Black Flute,Keepaway,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b3c0084474cd0c1fdb/1:1/w_160/a4e68a73.jpg,2012-01-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16125-black-flute/,Greedhead,"2010's Baby Style EP wasn't a fully formed mission statement for Keepaway, but it provided them with the next best thing an emerging young band could hope for: a killer single and options. ""Yellow Wings"" was the last of the great tracks to emerge in the immediate wake of Merriweather Post Pavilion's enormous influence, and although the EP's scattered nature made it easy to view the group as adept adapters of musical trends, a sonic realization of their gregarious personality felt inevitable. The Brooklyn band can be pretty hard to peg, but they maintain a very entertaining Twitter feed, make hip-hop beats on the side, and their debut, Black Flute, is being released on Das Racist's Greedhead label. So, having our full attention and the weight of expectations, how do Keepaway choose to reintroduce themselves? Here's the first line on ""Cake"": ""Everything/ Wa-oh-oh-oh-oh/ Tastes like lemons."" Okay, so it's no surprise that these guys skew a little hackysack, but it's not so much what Nick Nauman says right there, but how it sticks out so blatantly. Black Flute executes a frankly baffling gameplan that forefronts Nauman's newly grating vocals, the timbre and content of which serve as the anchors in Black Flute's thudding disappointment. They've done away with the wavy, reverb-soaked production that typified ""Yellow Wings"" and ""5 Rings"", which at least superficially feels like a wise decision: After all, who hasn't tired of that kind of thing over the past couple of years? Of course, that mindset overlooks the possibility that some acts are just better off with some sort of sonic obfuscation, and Black Flute wholly hitches itself to group-hug harmonies and lyrics that are intelligible but inscrutable conflations of philosophy, sex, and religion. It's occasionally welcoming, but mostly confusing in a manner akin to walking in on the culmination of a dorm-room bull session. Credit to Keepaway for being a band that seems to have an investment in what they actually say, even if they do traffic in awkward carnality (so says ""Vital"": ""Every cat's gotta scratch, gotta run/ Can I make you find the milk on the tip of my tongue"") and vaguely stoned revelations as impenetrable as adobe slabs. ""Hologram"" tries to coalesce Garden of Eden imagery with sci-fi futurism, but mostly sounds like a Yeasayer demo, and even without the trippy studio effects, tracks like ""Royal Jelly"" tend to drift thanks to run-on fantasias like ""16 royal elephants/ I'm hardly running/ But I'm moving twice as fast as them/ Each one has a rider/ Dressed in royal armor."" I mean, make fun of Rusted Root all you want, but at least they yodeled what they meant. There's a certain logic to it all, and some of Black Flute manages to lodge itself into your brain on sheer repetition, even if it doesn't always feel particularly welcome. There are hooks situated within this fruitopia of light-stepping reggae (""Cake"", ""Bomb Track""), Casio synth-pop (""Hologram""), and unmoored R&B balladry (the closing ""Purple"") that aspire to the sonically dry but lyrically louche configuration of early Prince. But in light of the lush production they contributed to Das Racist (especially ""Amazing"" from Sit Down, Man), you question why they've grown so enamored with all these Tinker Toy drum patterns and a bass that occasionally sounds like it's not even plugged in. And so rather than stressing its lilting harmonies and sopping atmosphere, ""Vital"" doubles down on Nauman's near-falsetto, which has the shrieking edge of Avey Tare, but none of the catharsis. Considering the promise Keepaway had initially shown, you want to give Black Flute the benefit of the doubt, digging past its surface miscues for deep-seated flaws that might not be their own fault-- is it the culmination of Animal Collective's opening the tent for Phishheads combined with the judgment-aversion fostered by the social networking presence of Brooklyn's increasingly chummy indie scene?  Or is it an LP-length extension of ""Deep Ass Shit (You'll Get It When You're High)""? Or maybe Black Flute just feels so suited for campus quads because it folds so quickly in the face of pragmatic scrutiny, its dime-thin arrangements and cashed-bowl musings equal parts self-denial and self-indulgence.","The Brooklyn band's debut LP, released on Das Racist's Greedhead label, finds the trio doing away with the wavy, reverb-soaked production of 2010's Baby Style EP, forefronting lyrics that are inscrutable conflations of philosophy, sex, and religion.

"Free Again: The ""1970"" Sessions",Alex Chilton,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c613d197565213a81f/1:1/w_160/d11c6e34.jpeg,2012-01-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16137-free-again-the-1970-sessions/,Omnivore,"By 1970, Alex Chilton was barely old enough to vote but already enough of a music biz veteran to be completely jaded by the industry. His short tenure in the Box Tops produced two million-selling hits, ""The Letter"" and ""Cry Like a Baby"", but the group's sound and direction were determined almost exclusively by producers Chips Moman and Dan Penn, who rarely diverged from the group's R&B-laced rock'n'roll. They chose almost all of the Box Tops' songs, dictated how they should be sung, and relegated Chilton's own compositions to hastily recorded B-sides, denying the singer not only his creative freedom but potential royalties as well. Whether this was the heavy hand of a svengali or the harried influence of a producer-cum-babysitter is debatable, but after an aborted tour of Europe, the Box Tops fell apart. Free from the demands of that hit group, Chilton holed up in Memphis' Ardent Studios with producer/founder John Fry and engineer Terry Manning to record a batch of his own songs. The sessions were casual and low-key, resulting in a full album of material that was never released. Instead, Chilton formed a new band, called Big Star, which translated British power pop to American shores. But those 1970 sessions became lore among Big Star fans, passed around as rumors or bootlegs until 1996, when Ardent released them as 1970. That collection has since gone out of print, and now Omnivore Records has reissued it with bonus tracks, following up last year's excellent white-label edition of Big Star's Third. This music represents the midpoint between the Box Tops and Big Star almost too literally, as Chilton volleys between blues-rock rave-ups like ""All I Really Want Is Money"" and softly sung pop ballads like ""The EMI Song (Smile for Me)"". The transitions can be jarring, especially as he switches between his low, gruff vocals and his mod-ish falsetto. It's hard to believe it's the same human being singing those songs. And yet, on some level, this collection may be one of the purest expressions of Chilton's personality-- not only his dreamy ruminations but also his coarse humor. According to the new liner notes by Bob Mehr, Chilton made fun of Moman and other producers for being out of touch with current sounds, specifically the British Invasion. This mocking spirit extends to ""All I Really Want Is Money"" and ""I Wish I Could Meet Elvis"", which seem to take the piss out of the Box Tops. There's a telling contradiction embedded in these half-assed numbers: Chilton obviously adores the rhythm and bluster of these songs, yet he has been conditioned to resent the style, to view R&B as a hopelessly passé genre. His performances become caricatures of black blues vocals, or perhaps caricatures of white approximations of black blues vocals. It can be an uncomfortable listen, especially when he sings, ""that's all I cares about in de world,"" on ""All I Really Want Is Money"". Perhaps because we know about his troubles with the Box Tops, Chilton's perspective-- that of a white teenager whose voice had been conditioned to resemble that of a black man-- remains oddly compelling in its jumpy defiance, especially on the gloriously perverse covers of the Stones' ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and the Archies' ""Sugar Sugar"" (which gets mashed up with James Brown's ""I Got the Feelin'""). On the other hand, songs like ""If You Would Marry Me Babe"" and ""All We Ever Got From Them Was Pain"" sound like templates for some of Chilton's best-known Big Star numbers, contrasting his cynical streak with an earnestly romantic side. ""The EMI Song (Smile for Me)"" may be the sweetest and most delicate melody he ever wrote, and ""It Isn't Always That Easy"" is a ruminative acoustic demo that exposes the ravages of Chilton's short career to date. On ""The Happy Song"", he tries on a nudie suit for size, and the country snare patter and steel guitar fit his vocals so perfectly it's not hard to imagine what other avenues he might have traveled in subsequent decades. Free Again doesn't simply predict his work with Big Star; in fact, these songs eerily prefigure much of his solo material, which deconstructed-- often messily or carelessly, but occasionally beautifully-- everything he once held dear. Even as a teenager, he had an inclination to undercut every expectation, even his own. ""Every Day as We Grow Closer"" may be a quiet song with a lovely melody and a huge impact, but he nearly ruins the effect by appending a short, tongue-in-cheek jam at the end. For many listeners, this aspect of Free Again may be off-putting, like hearing a comedian tell only inside jokes. This release, much like Rhino's 1970, is certainly not intended as an introduction to Chilton's music. Instead, it's more like an endpoint for devoted fans looking to connect the dots. As such, it provides a fascinating coming-of-age story of an artist who came into his own playing styles he knew he loved and others he only thought he hated.","In 1970, after the Box Tops and before forming Big Star, Alex Chilton holed up in a Memphis studio and recorded an album's worth of material.

Boss of All Bosses 3,Cam’ronDJ DramaVado,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2da13d197565213a83a/1:1/w_160/a8cb7184.jpeg,2012-01-09 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16157-boss-of-all-bosses-3/,Diplomat,"As Jay-Z once said, ""Men lie, women lie, numbers don't."" Apparently, that memo never reached Cam'ron and Vado, whose latest joint mixtape, Boss of All Bosses 3, is actually their fifth entry in an increasingly tired series. (It follows Boss of All Bosses 1, 2, 2.5, and 2.8.) Diehard Dipset fans might turn up a few tracks here where the light of Cam's Purple Haze-era peak still flickers, but Vado, once New York's next great hope, appears so rarely that the collaborative billing feels a little misleading. Boss of All Bosses 3 is symptomatic of the current era where only a handful of rappers can get albums in stores and on time. Rappers like Cam and Vado need to flood the market to keep their names on the blogs' front page, but they also have to hope that the inherent diminishing returns of a seemingly endless mixtape series don't permanently turn off listeners. Vado should be keeping up with guys like A$AP Rocky and French Montana who have more or less assumed his buzz and replaced him in the food chain that decides which rappers might actually get to put out a real life album or take a little bit of radio airtime away from Young Money. Cam, on the other hand, is presumably looking to convince label execs that he's still a relevant artist worth an investment, a proposition that stands to lead, at best, to a internet rumors. For listeners, a tape like this begs the question: When is enough enough? At this point, new Dipset just sounds like old Dipset, and old Dipset is way more kinetic. The production here recalls the blustery symphonies of their heyday, but Cam's disengaged flow, which once felt like the epitome of cockiness, no longer sounds hungry. He still cracks a few good lines and drops the occasional sideways reference, but the Cam of ""sake, Suzuki, Osaka Bay"" is far in the rearview. A few tracks fare better than others: ""Keys in tha Damier"" isn't too far from the sample-driven bangers of Dipset yesteryear, and ""Talk My Nigga"" has the fiercest rapping on the tape despite both rappers jacking their cadence from Crazy Town's ""Butterfly"". But the appeal of these tracks isn't likely to resonate with non-diehards. There's so much invigorating rap coming out of New York (and elsewhere) right now, but Boss of All Bosses 3 isn't exactly among the most inspiring. There's no harm in plucking out a few dope tracks for a playlist, but there's so much more heat, spirit, and conviction in the back catalog. Isn't it about time you broke out disc two of Diplomatic Immunity?","Despite the misleading title, Cam'ron and Vado's latest mixtape is actually the fifth in their Boss of All Bosses series.

Box Set,Neutral Milk Hotel,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2dd5e6ef9596932237f/1:1/w_160/b82a91a4.jpg,2012-01-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16160-box-set/,Neutral Milk Hotel,"If you were around when Neutral Milk Hotel were a working band, it would have been difficult to predict the stature they'd later acquire in the independent rock sphere. That they were great, and special, was clear to a lot of people following indie rock, but they didn't necessarily seem like the kind of group that would develop into something amounting to a ""legend."" For one thing, they were visible during the mid and late 1990s, doing exactly the same kinds of things other indie rock bands were doing. They were on Merge, putting out albums, EPs, and singles, touring the same venues as young bands like Modest Mouse and Helium. They weren't under-appreciated and were by no means obscure; and the fact that they were part of a ""scene"" that made for such great copy-- the Elephant 6 Recording Company-- meant they got their share of attention in the indie music press. But then they went away. Jeff Mangum, the project's creative force, stopped releasing new music and quit playing shows. Yet unlike the followers of many bands from that time who moved on, his fans didn't trickle away. Instead, in place of a working band with a growing catalog, Neutral Milk Hotel became an absent band with a growing cult. People were rediscovering this music, and the median age of the Neutral Milk Hotel obsessive has continued to hover in the early twenties. Since Mangum's return to performing, first as part of the Elephant 6 reunion in 2008 and then with a slate of shows last year, Neutral Milk Hotel started to seem like something that existed in the present tense again. Possibly serving as a sort of tribute to this moment, Mangum has released this limited vinyl-only box set, which collects almost all of the material released under the Neutral Milk Hotel name and adds 15 additional rare and unreleased tracks. I've met people who adore In the Aeroplane Over the Sea and didn't know that Neutral Milk Hotel had ever released anything else, so it's tempting to view everything Mangum released with an eye to the part it played in the Aeroplane story. And while it's a settled matter that Aereoplane is the high-water mark for the band (as well as being one of the best indie rock records of the last two decades), I can tell you that at the time there were plenty of people who felt that its predecessor, 1996's On Avery Island, was nearly its equal. Certainly, Avery has a comparatively muffled sound and doesn't always seem to understand how to best showcase Mangum's gifts (his voice is often double-tracked and lower in the mix and hence less distinctive), but on a song-by-song basis it has almost as many great moments. The opening ""Song Against Sex"" is one of them, a fuzz rocker with a hypnotically catchy and repetitive melody and lyrics that hint at the awkwardness and alienation that draws people toward Mangum's work. NMH's world is a place where sex is fumbling, a reliably imperfect expression of an emotion that dreamers want to see perfected. And in ""Song Against Sex"", drugs and porn and staged representations of lust are so repellent that the narrator wants to leave the world altogether. It's the kind of sentiment that teenagers who feel assaulted by their surroundings will continue to discover, and its wide-eyed and wounded view of the world goes a long way toward explaining why they keep returning to this songwriter. Despite its vague and decidedly lo-fi profile, Avery also has its share of experimentation, and it's well integrated into the songs themselves. The album was produced by Robert Schneider of Apples in Stereo, whose house-producer role in the E6 sphere you might compare to Conny Plank's in the German experimental rock underground. I believe that's Schneider's voice talking excitedly as ""Song Against Sex"" opens, encouraging Mangum and describing his performance as ""perfect,"" and Mangum has spoken repeatedly about how important his enthusiasm and belief was to the NMH project. The way Schneider and Mangum structured Avery, it feels like a suite, tunes bunched together with interludes and repeating motifs and details that fade away and then return a few songs later. The lurching ""Marching Theme"" may not have the memorable arrangement of the following record's instrumental ""The Fool"", but the surging fuzz guitar and odd, snaking keyboard melody form a superb bridge between the acoustic ""Baby for Pree"" and the electric variation on the same gorgeous melody that follows, ""Where You'll Find Me Now"". The simple horn and organ duet ""Avery Island/April 1st"" connects that to the comparatively fierce ""Gardenhead/Leave Me Alone"", and ""Naomi"" is another key Mangum track, not least for its strangely wandering melody. The closing ""Pree-Sisters Swallowing a Donkey's Eye"", 13 minutes on CD but 10 minutes shorter on vinyl, is a throbbing drone piece that sometimes touches on noise music, putting it in league with similar experiments by NMH's sister band, Olivia Tremor Control. If Avery could reasonably be compared to other music going on in the Elephant 6 sphere in the mid and late 1990s, Aeroplane is where Mangum created something with no easy reference points. Mixing Salvation Army band pomp, hushed folk, roaring power pop, and almost unbearably intense guitar and voice songs that are difficult to classify, Aeroplane still feels like one of a kind, 14 years and countless inspired bands later. It's never not been a part of the conversation in indie rock since it was reissued in 2005, and suffice to say that it has lost none of its power. It's always been mastered loud and with a mix that puts Mangum's voice right in your face, and the remaster here is just a hair softer and rounder but otherwise wisely does little to alter its forceful sonic character. Aeroplane is the sound of an artist fully in tune with his creativity putting himself out there with an almost painful sense of vulnerability, and the reverberations from that statement are still being felt after a decade and a half. I wrote at length about the record when it was reissued in 2005 and don't have much to add here, except that the packaging and sound of this reissue are first rate. As an addendum, the gorgeous picture disc/poster sleeve 7"" of ""Holland 1945"", backed by a live version of ""Engine"", first released in 1998, is nice to have in circulation. Beyond the two proper albums, the box offers a mix of revelations and welcome artifacts. Early song ""Everything Is"" has been been released in various configurations over the years, as both a two-song 7"" and as a proper EP, and it's included here in expanded EP form as a 10"". Originally released in 1994, it finds Mangum in a much different place in terms of both songwriting and performance. This is where he felt most Elephant 6, enamored with the pop of the 1960s and doing his best to sing sweetly, in a higher and smoother register, to make his voice palatable. The title track and ""Tuesday Moon"" (once identified on a comp as ""Love You on a Tuesday"") are basically solid, down-the-middle guitar pop songs recorded crudely but with a hint of the spark that would lead to so much more. ""Ruby Bulbs"", the first song Mangum ever officially released, is raw and noisy and shouty and reflects Mangum's interest in aggro punk, an influence that didn't otherwise surface on his records. All in all, the Everything Is EP feels gestational and enjoyable but ultimately unexceptional; had things ended here, Neutral Milk Hotel might be as well remembered as E6 compatriots the Gerbils. The Ferris Wheel on Fire 10"" EP, on the other hand, is the real treasure of the set. Hearing Mangum in acoustic mode (there are seven demos here and a recording from an in-store), it's striking how much these recordings from 1992 to 1996 sound so much more like his later style compared to what was issued on Everything Is. ""Oh Sister"", from 1995 perfectly captures that moment of the growing boldness of his songwriting; the strums and vocals seem very ""Two Headed Boy"", and it has some melodic and lyrical motifs from that song. ""My Dream Girl Don't Exist"", possibly the most well-known unreleased Mangum song, feels like a dry run for Aeroplane, with strummed chords reminiscent of ""The King of Carrot Flowers"", lyrics about a dead girl in the ground, and a closing ""now she knows she'll never be afraid"" that was later used on ""Ghost"". The studio version of ""Engine"" is quite close to the version released on the B-side of the ""Holland 1945"" single, and other songs (""A Baby for Pree/Glow Into You"", ""April 8th"") found their way to On Avery Island. Hearing acoustic songs and demos from the early days of Neutral Milk Hotel and marveling at how fully realized they sound, Ferris Wheel on Fire reminds me most of Time of No Reply, the posthumous collection of Nick Drake rarities and outtakes that evokes the sound of Pink Moon more than either of his two other properly released records. It's certainly a fans-only collection, but it also stands well on its own, with a unified sound and mood. One 7"" included on the record serves more as an extension of Ferris Wheel, with versions of songs released elsewhere. ""You've Passed"" and ""Where You'll Find Me Now"" both made it onto Avery. The first is not terribly different, it sounds like the basic arrangement and sound had been determined, but the fuzz guitar has more roar in the riff. The second is a welcome change-up: much slower, more downcast, less desperate, less naked. The other 7"" has two versions of ""Little Birds""-- one recorded at home, one with Robert Schneider-- which happens to be the one song here that was written after the release of Aeroplane. It's a harrowing composition that is dedicated to Matthew Shepard, who was murdered two months before the song was composed in December 1998, and its lyrics, ""Another boy in town at night he took him for his lover/ And deep in sin they held each other/ So I took a hammer and nearly beat his little brains in/ Knowing God in heaven could have, never could forgive him,"" seem to reference the incident. It's clear in spending time with this set and listening to it in varying sequences that Mangum the songwriter liked to tinker. On this evidence he was not prolific, but he also didn't waste ideas. Parts of songs pop up in other tracks, variations get turned into extended sequences, songs are divided into parts. The seven-or-so-year songwriting arc represented here yielded only about two-dozen completely distinct songs, and a clutch more that are variations on some of those themes. An overlooked element of Neutral Milk Hotel's enduring appeal is that Mangum stopped making new music at the precise moment that music was about to become ""an internet thing."" A year after Aeroplane came Napster, and pretty soon the way we hear and experience music would never be the same. But Neutral Milk Hotel remain, as if preserved in amber, in that moment when independent music was bought in stores and spread by word of mouth that came from actual mouths. A moment when people had to hold something physical in their hands to be able to experience the music, whether tape, vinyl, or CD. And it's fitting that this box set has been assembled with care and high-quality materials that seem bound to last well into the time when the next generation discovers this music. ""There are some lives you live and some you leave behind,"" Mangum sings in ""Gardenhead"", and it's such a perfect line for this guy. He left the music-making life behind for years, and now, maybe, he's inching back toward it. Even if he never gets there, whether by choice or because forces of whatever kind conspire against him, there's the music contained here, rich and beautiful enough to fill a career.","This lavish vinyl-only box set collects the two proper Neutral Milk Hotel albums along with two 10"" EPs and three 7""s. Taken together, it's a rewarding, carefully constructed tribute to Jeff Mangum's distinctive songwriting voice.

Spills Out,Pterodactyl,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d1b1335d7bf169a4c5/1:1/w_160/aef2d225.jpeg,2012-01-06 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16149-pterodactyl-spills-out/,Jagjaguwar,"Focus too long on any one part of Spills Out, the third LP from psych-splattered Brooklynite post-punk manglers Pterodactyl, and you risk losing track of the rest of it. The sprawling set from the shapeshifting band is bristling with basement-show energy one minute, stacking haunting Zombies-style harmonies the next. The pixelated, post-everything whoosh of their earlier, more forceful records is still very much in evidence on Spills Out, but it's as though their turn-on-a-dime cubism's been given the SpinArt treatment, globs of melody pooling at its edges. This unlikely meetup-- of Les Savy Fav's hard-driving antsiness, the Olivia Tremor Control's echoing psych-pop, Abe Vigoda's clangy hot-weather punk, and any three or four second-tier SST bands of your choosing-- sometimes smacks of eclectic overextension, but for the most part, Spills Out manages to revel in its own clutter. Spills Out's first five numbers are all about propulsion, zig-zagging melodies and breathless vocals underpinned by insistent, edge-of-calamity drumbeats. This, in large part, is the art-punking Pterodactyl of old, never ones to shy away from melody, provided they can make it move. At times, the vigorous rhythms threaten to get the best of the trickily constructed tunes they're mobilizing, but at this pace, they leave precious little time to notice. The woozy lurch of ""Allergy Shots"" is quite a toneshift, its duskily triumphant melody marching its way directly into your pituitary region. Though 2010's Arnold's Park saw Pterodactyl playing around with psychedelia-- the acoustic flitters of Sung Tongs-era Animal Collective, among other things-- here, Spills Out burrows its way into the rabbit hole on something of a mid-album mini-suite of thick, woozy psych. Rife with spectral sound effects and blurry, tape-stressing maximalism, many of these songs could've fallen off the back end of last year's stellar Olivia Tremor Control reissues. Like the Olivias, Pterodactyl wrest cohesion from calamity by soldiering surefootedly through all these far-flung juxtapositions, presenting these disparate styles as though they're supposed to go together. But even on the sprightlier numbers, Pterodactyl's formidable instrumental prowess sometimes blots out the songs themselves; with tempos slowed and melodies pushed to the forefront rather than rattling around the edges, they're downplaying their strengths in favor of an experiment that proves only somewhat successful. When, as on ""The Break"", they match the two sides together-- its drums rollicking, its harmonies circuitous-- Pterodactyl's messy vision for Spills Out is given its clearest expression. For the most part, the record's final third does a nice job blending the two, squeezing little bits of baroque-bent vocalism or sci-fi sound collage in between the pummels. Their knack for jittery melody's always fared best when matched to forward motion, and though much of Spills Out seems to zip by in a blur, it's assembled with enough care to never quite spin out from its center. It can be more than a little dizzying, with all that stuff whizzing by, to settle on any particular chorus or guitar riff for too long. But throwing yourself in Spills Out's path means letting it reconfigure your circuits, and it's hard to come out the other side not feeling pretty good about getting frazzled.","The sprawling third album from the Brooklyn post-punks bristles with basement-show energy one minute, haunting Zombies-style harmonies the next.

Jet World Order,Jet Life,by: Jeff Weiss,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cbb1335d7bf169a4ba/1:1/w_160/7a1c348d.jpeg,2012-01-06 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16144-jets-jet-world-order/,Jets International,"Rap's no stranger to backronyms. Wu-Tang was the Witty and Unpredictable, Talented and Natural Gang. Thug Life became the Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everyone. But none is arguably more fitting than the J.E.T.S.' motto: Just Enjoy This Shit. At a time when rap's standard-bearers are often unnaturally saccharine or overbearingly Eeyorish, Spitta, Smoke DZA, Mikey Rocks, Fiend, Young Roddy, and Trademark da Skydiver are preternaturally indifferent to the perils of fame. Jet World Order is Alfred E. Neuman rap. What me worry? Just listen to the drawling hook of ""Exhale"": ""Never stressing over chicks or ends/ Light it up, inhale, exhale/ Blow it in the wind."" No need to trip when you're chemically focused on weed, women, and the winner's circle. This album has less range than the menu at In-N-Out, but no one ever went there looking for tacos. Theoretically, such tired terrain should make a record more dull than watching Adult Swim sober. But credit Curren$y and company for emulating the weed they smoke: They know to make being bored seem fun. A former member of the 40-man roster of No Limit and understudy at Cash Money, Curren$y has clearly absorbed the label-building strategies of his former patrons. Wisely, he's recruited a like-minded set that rarely diverges from his aesthetic, but maintains enough identity to stay alert. There's Fiend, the No Limit soldier and Ruff Ryders refugee in the midst of a minor renaissance, who pops up on  ""Picture Perfect"" with a flow so smooth it should be permanently draped in a scarlet silk smoking jacket. DZA, the ""fat boy of the set"" brings a dilated Uptown cool, munching on crawfish, and bragging about how your girlfriend Tweets at him. Trademark and Roddy get the most green lights, and while both acquit themselves, neither is yet a threat to take pole position. The compilation's purpose is self-evident: to leverage Curren$y's star and earn attention for his set. It's a role that rap crews have regularly employed since at least Marley Marl's In Control, Volume 1. Most of the time, it's a mixed bag, depending on the label, its roster, and how much weed was wasted that day in the lab. Jet World Order doesn't exactly break the mold. But what it lacks in cohesion, it covers in aimless cool. And with slow-roasted soul supplied by Monsta Beatz, Cookin' Soul, et al., the beats neatly align with the low-lidded laissez faire of the rappers. Jet World Order is the bizarro stoner twin of Self Made, Rick Ross' Maybach Music comp from last year. Rozay, Pill, Meek Mill, and Wale are the connoisseurs who want to get high from a $500 volcano, order useless gadgets from Brookstone, and eat expensive room service off arthropod platters. The Jets twist spliffs and make their women bring them take out. For all their occasional avarice, they're weirdly sensible. On ""Exhale"", Curren$y brags about still watching DVDs on the Playstation and spotting good commercial real estate deals. He manages to offer frugal relatibility and an aspiration ideal. Well-played. Rap is predicated on the idea of who would you want to get high with. And right now, the Jets' run that lane. Rating an album like this feels like flipping through an issue of High Times, where obsessives blather in microscopic detail about the fluorescence and genetics of a new strain of sativa. Sure there's a couple of mediocre beats and a few too many boilerplate verses about getting blunted, but really, the only question that matters is whether you want to get high to this. You probably should just enjoy this shit.","This smoked-up compilation's purpose is self-evident: to leverage Curren$y's star and earn attention for his Jet Life crew.

Back $ellin' Crack,Squadda B,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d45e6ef95969322374/1:1/w_160/8e8de640.jpeg,2012-01-06 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16151-squadda-b-back-ellin-crack/,self-released,"Last month, 2011's breakout indie rapper Danny Brown sat down with Impose magazine after being named their rapper of the year. When asked who his favorite rap act of 2011 had been, he named Bay Area duo Main Attrakionz, whose prolific output and undaunted adoption of the burgeoning ""cloud rap"" sub-genre has earned them a growing profile and a diverse collection of fans. ""They talking street shit,"" Brown explained of Squadda B and MondreM.A.N., ""but they talking it over those trippy-ass, cloudy-ass beats."" The co-sign still felt a little surprising: On one hand, anyone who has heard 808s & Dark Grapes II, the group's most notable release to date, knows how easily pleasing their half-baked creations can be. But on the other, for a guy like Brown-- whose wildman persona is often one of his great draws on record-- putting on for two guys who are often criticized for both not having a ton of personality, and sometimes being unable to think outside of their own little box, seemed somewhat incongruent. Take for instance last year's I Smoke Because I Don't Care About Death, the excellently titled but not totally memorable solo mixtape from Squadda B, which featured a smattering of awfully cloudy tracks that found a guy sounding so comfortable in his own lane, it seemed as if he'd never get over. Which is why Back $ellin' Crack, which squeaked in right before 2011's final bell rang, may provide some clues as to why we might be seeing more straightforward music coming from the Main Attrakionz camp in the new year. Just looking at that borderline-NSFW album cover above, it's clear that Back $ellin' Crack is not strictly another cloud-rap affair. Instead, Squadda has crafted a mixtape's mixtape, with strong, varied production styles that could complement any assortment of rappers. And while unsurprisingly lacking in content-rich lyricism, this center-of-left approach proves to be a step in the right direction, with Squadda's oddball tendencies and workmanlike demeanor still intact. There is a lot of personality to be found on Back $ellin' Crack, but it's helpful that, working outside of his normal routine, Squadda never appears to feel the need to play keep-up or bend to the will of a beat. ""Down"", which features barn-burning verses from MA affiliate Shady Blaze and Danny Brown himself, is probably most indicative of Squadda's focus here. Some rappers would feel hard-pressed to set off the double-time fireworks just to remain visible, but his ability to play the background and let others shine where applicable (one of the benefits of normally having to share the spotlight with another MC) is a real asset. Which isn't to say that he's using the rest of his time here most wisely: ""Rapgame"", which boasts some Supreme Clientele-grade silkiness, finds Squadda both reflective and funny (""Wonder if they think I'm lyin' about the shit I spit/ Can I at least get a chance to start lyin' about shit?""), while ""Van Halen"" opens with some weirdly appealing, atonal singsong rap. But most fun of all might be ""The Greenova Way"", with its Looney Tuned-up beat (courtesy of Squadda himself) allowing him to playfully jab at the pigeonholers: ""They call it cloud rap/ Wanna see me? Then look up!"" But not all of Back $ellin' Crack is nearly as effective. The second half of the tape, which heavily features MondreM.A.N., feels too safe compared to the material that preceded it. None of it really has anything to do with Mondre's presence, nor the way Squadda and he sound on these tracks together-- in fact, stuff like ""Conversations Pt. II"" makes for a solid entry in the Main Attrakionz catalog. But in context, it's a step backward, especially considering how much effort Squadda has put into taking the duo's established sound and repurposing it for audiences more drawn to conventional approaches. By the time ""Cream Soda"" shows up-- which unfortunately finds Squadda rapping over Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" (what Frank Ocean hath wrought!)-- there's a distinct sense that Back $ellin' Crack's ambition has dried up. Stick around though, because there's still the two-part, seven-and-a-half-minute opus ""Hail Squadda"" to feast on. Combining the warped, crystalline lean-back synths of producer Marlee B's opening portion (complete with a creeped-out repurposing of the ""Hail Mary"" chorus) with Status Star's thunderous finale, Danny Brown's prediciton becomes even clearer: ""You could totally put that shit over a Lex Lugar beat and it'd be a fucking street song."" It's some seriously tough stuff, and even further proof that when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.","Not strictly another cloud-rap affair, Main Attrakionz's Squadda B has crafted a mixtape's mixtape, with strong, varied production styles that could complement any assortment of rappers.

Bestival Live 2011,The Cure,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2aab1335d7bf169a48c/1:1/w_160/be093b50.jpeg,2012-01-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16120-bestival-2011/,PIAS,"The Cure are nearly three-and-a-half decades deep in the game and have never been shy about monetizing their seemingly boundless recorded output. So it's something of a surprise that Bestival 2011 is their first official live record since the double-shot of 1993's Paris and Show, which capitalized on Wish boosting the band to its commercial zenith. The Cure have kept busier than a band of its status has needed to since then, releasing four studio records, a second greatest hits collection, and an intimidating, comprehensive B-sides collection, while Robert Smith parlayed his godfather status into guest spots on Blink-182 and Crystal Castles singles. But these things are often as novel as their setlist, and Bestival's intentions could not be clearer, accounting for the Cure's existence between 1993 and 2011 with a grand total of 10 minutes of music. Then again, in a setting such as this one, fans who paid a couple days' salary for festival tickets like to have their preconceptions confirmed. Since Paris and Show, that's a one-hot-album-every-18-year average-- and I say that aware that a lot of people don't even have an abnormally generous relationship with Bloodflowers like I do. But even if the Cure's discography is riddled with redundancies, the question becomes: Who is Bestival even for? Particularly if completists almost certainly own Show and Paris, and newcomers to the band can (and often do) start with Staring at the Sea? Without a visual accompaniment, Bestival is best viewed as a testament to the Cure's longevity and stylistic breadth. But while the collection speaks highly of the Cure's professionalism, it never catches spark, save for a performance of ""The Caterpillar"", reportedly their first since 1984. And since each song sticks so closely to the script, there's never much development of an internal narrative to make this performance seem worthy of documentation, though you could let your ears go soft and see it as a sort of Benjamin Button effect where they scale from their most regal and sumptuous (""Plainsong"", ""Open"") to the wiry punk of the Three Imaginary Boys cuts that close out the set. At the very least, their professionalism extends to the actual recording-- the sound is crisp and clear, and even Smith's stage banter sounds remotely intelligible. His voice has aged astoundingly well, all the more impressive for how it maintains such a startling fidelity to its studio counterpart, no matter if he's straining desperately on the atomically negative ""One Hundred Years"" or purring the come-ons of ""Lullaby"". Yet that clinical treatment robs the Cure's more expansive numbers (""Disintegration"", ""Push"") of atmosphere and oddly minimizes them in open space, Smith's passionate guitar work just sounding kinda weedy. And often the loudest element of the mix is this Tupperware-snap snare that haunts anyone who's been within earshot of a hi-fi Dave Matthews Band bootleg. Not to mention the times when the professionalism works against the intent of the material. Even if there was always something arena-rock about ""Shake Dog Shake"", it's rendered toothless when stripped of the circumstantial psychosis from The Top's sessions, and while they can't not play ""Boys Don't Cry"", it's performed at a flat-footed ""we're gettin' too old for this shit"" pace. Meanwhile, sticking ""The End of the World"" and ""The Only One"" amongst ""A Night Like This"" and ""Lovesong"" as if they're every bit as part of the firmament is surely a noble attempt at revisionist history. But man, if you really want revisionist history, get to the end of this thing. Now, especially as it comes at the tail end of a two-hour peformance, the spirited, charged-up instrumental passages of this track are inspiring. But then Smith gets to the chorus and yelps, ""I am the stranger... KILLING ANOTHER."" I thought my promo copy had a typo, or it was a situation similar to when you could find copies of In Utero in retail stores with ""Waif Me"". ""Killing an Arab"" was misinterpreted by the same people Smith lashed out against on Cure's very embarrassing political rant ""Us or Them"" as being racially insensitive post-9/11, but it's just profoundly depressing to hear the song rendered all but completely meaningless when the mass setting should make it all the more resonant. Which is really the dynamic that's confusing about Bestival-- it's easy to enough to understand the thrill of hearing ""Friday I'm in Love"" or ""Just Like Heaven"" amidst tens of thousands, but at this point, the Cure feel like less of a band than a traveling museum or theme park celebrating their past with the occasional new exhibit or ride to stoke interest. In other words, a completely user-driven experience en masse: You want to remember them as minimalist, ghostly post-punkers? They're touring Seventeen Seconds and Faith in the ""Don't Look Back"" format. If you prefer your mopes to be more drawn-out and reverberant, there's the Trilogy DVD where they play Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers in their exact order, exactly as they're played on record (its replay value is exactly what you'd expect). As for Bestival? It's what I suppose is a great reminder about the vastness of the Cure's actual catalog and their real-time vitality as a band as opposed to merely their influence, but even two hours of their best stuff in this format feels less rewarding than spending 20 minutes cobbling together your own Spotify playlist. After all, the corollary to the Cure-as-a-business is that the customer's always right.","The Cure's first official live record since 1993 can best be viewed as a testament to the band's longevity and stylistic breadth, but while Besitval speaks highly of the group's professionalism, it rarely catches spark.

Themes For an Imaginary Film,Symmetry,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d05e6ef95969322367/1:1/w_160/7c0295f2.jpeg,2012-01-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16148-themes-for-an-imaginary-film/,Italians Do It Better,"Themes for an Imaginary Film* *arrives following the release of Drive, the film which Italians Do It Better star and Italo-disco producer Johnny Jewel was originally tapped to soundtrack. But much of his work (created with assistance from longtime collaborator Nat Walker of Chromatics and Desire) went unused in lieu of Cliff Martinez's score. There's no point in pretending that the Imaginary Film of this collection's title isn't that movie. The cover depicts a steering wheel and dashboard. The intro track begins with vehicle sounds. And the lengthy 37-track score suits Drive's distinctive blend of grit, glamour, and abject loneliness. Befitting its standalone release, though, this project does stand alone, and Themes for an Imaginary Film makes for an engrossing listen in a way that many film scores don't. Maybe it's because we can't hear the score over Drive itself, but Themes for an Imaginary Film makes up for its lack of a visual counterpart by telling a story of its own. Evocative, stirring, yet restrained, Jewel's mixture of eerie near-silences, ominously bubbling synths, and tearjerking melodies (rendered by real-life viola and cello players) is a formidable combination. For anyone expecting a quasi-album full of orchestral overtures or ambient mood pieces, Themes for an Imaginary Film's opening run will set you right: ""City of Dreams"" and ""Over the Edge"" are driven by Jewel's usual assortment of grainy analog synths and brittle guitars, and there's even a slight beat underlaid, though it's more like a faint heartbeat than the disco-driven rhythms of Glass Candy or Chromatics. But by the time we get to track six (""Outside Looking In""), the beats disappear and are replaced by moody, glacial waves of sound, reminding us that this is, in fact, a film soundtrack. Appropriately, Jewel's sonics are adjusted for their new setting. Though he uses his trademark sounds well, the claustrophobic, sweaty-club vibe that defines Chromatics and Glass Candy is completely absent. Compositions like the fantastic ""Behind the Wheel"" are either left completely dry, with their synth elements at the fore sounding bigger and clearer (the harshly distorted ""Death Mask"" is almost wince-inducing), or awash with reverb, like the woozy ""The Maze"" or the lonely electric piano lament ""Hall of Mirrors"". The spare, disconsolate atmosphere perfectly complements the film it was meant for, but it also makes for an immersive listen, with an unusual amount of space allowed for within Jewel's music. At two hours and 37 tracks long, Themes for an Imaginary Film is not exactly easy to digest in one sitting. But just as it bypasses many of the caveats associated with film scores, so it does with overlong albums: Themes works as well as mood music as it does close listening, and the way it swims between rhythm-driven beatscapes and ambient swells provides enough tension for it to unobtrusively grab your attention every once in a while. There's never too much drama, and there's never too much silence. The record is immaculately paced. For you impatient listeners out there, a number of highlights are worth taking out of their original context. In addition to the aforementioned, ""Magic Gardens"" features an overwhelming synth line that sounds like the ""Streets of Philadelphia"" refrain blotting out the sun, and with some fleshing out, the teasingly short ""Nightshift"" (appearing twice) could easily be a Chromatics stunner. The lack of any sort of human presence-- outside of the automated voice that begins the score and the ambulance sirens and police radio that appear chillingly halfway through-- is shattered with the album's closer ""Streets of Fire"". Performed almost entirely a cappella by Chromatics singer Ruth Radelet, the song is a stunningly naked, somber ending to the 2.5 hours that precede it. Combining plaintive lyrics with a nursery-rhyme melody, it trades the dangerous seductiveness or dirty street suavity of Jewel's other projects for pure sorrow. Themes for an Imaginary Film isn't a decadent disco soundtrack like Goblin might have made, nor a noodly synth odyssey à la John Carpenter or Vangelis. Rather, it's something completely Jewel's own, blending his distinctively fragile synthetic textures with a suitably cinematic realism that he's rarely let show. Whether you treat it as background music, incidental listening, or a two-hour magnum opus, Themes for an Imaginary Film is a well-rounded portrait of a key figure in the American electronic music landscape.","Italians Do It Better producer Johnny Jewel (Glass Candy, Chromatics) was originally tapped to score last fall's blockbuster movie, Drive, but much of his music went unused. Themes for an Imaginary Film is presumably that score, but stands alone as a well-rounded portrait of a key figure in the American electronic music landscape.

Stay Asleep (Regression Vol. 2),Nate Young,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2af13d197565213a7f1/1:1/w_160/350c2d70.jpg,2012-01-05 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16123-stay-asleep-regression-vol-2/,NNA Tapes,"Nate Young might not have meant the title of his 2009 LP Regression as a description of his musical direction. But the album's stark, slow tones are a sonic reduction compared to his work with John Olson in Stare Case, a project that itself trims back the noise the pair make as a part of Wolf Eyes. Young's path hasn't been completely linear-- Wolf Eyes often sound stark, too, and Regression included a few noisy moments.But his sequel to Regression, Stay Asleep, might be his most minimal work ever. Each of the album's five songs is built from two basic elements-- a loop of low notes and a metronomic beat. Synths and other electronics add small accents, but often the bass and rhythm march forward unadorned. With this small arsenal of sounds, Young makes music that gets tenser without actually changing much. It's tough to put a finger on how his repetitive notes can feel like a stair-climb instead of a still-life. Every track is pretty clean-- there are no hazy sonics or cloaking distortion. Yet when I listen, I'm less aware of what's happening musically than the mood the music creates. That mood is almost always eerie and dark. Young's sparse approach gives Stay Asleep tons of negative sonic space, making it as creepy as an unlit basement. The horror-movie feel is similar to that of Prurient's last record, Bermuda Drain. But where Dominick Fernow openly mimics the tropes of 1970s slasher soundtracks, Young's songs are more like analogues to onscreen suspense. In his tick-tock tones, time seems to creep unstoppably toward potential doom. For Young, though, Stay Asleep isn't so much a countdown to danger as a guard against it, ""a hex sign... that can protect against the 'evil eye.'"" As he explained to Tiny Mix Tapes, ""I like the idea of distracting negative energy with art and holding it at bay."" Closer ""Collapse"" succeeds at that goal, with piano chords that suggest rising optimism in the face of gloom. But it's also the album's weirdest track, with Olson's horns and (ex-Wolf Eye) Aaron Dilloway's tape effects adding a warpy insanity. Ending with such a surreal tone suggests that the title Stay Asleep is an actual command. Maybe this isn't a horror movie but simply a dream, and the only real danger is waking up from its entrancing sounds.","Wolf Eyes/Stare Case member Nate Young's eerie, dark solo LP-- a sequel to 2009's Regression featuring members of Wolf Eyes past and present-- might be his most minimal work to date.

I Want What You Want,Jennifer O'Connor,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b6ea9e61561daa698f/1:1/w_160/9c23bc71.jpg,2012-01-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16129-i-want-what-you-want/,Kiam,"It's hard to say where Jennifer O'Connor fits into the world. Over the past decade she's tried a few different nooks and crannies: After releasing her debut on her own Kiam Records in 2002 and a second album on Red Panda in 2005, she joined the ranks of Matador Records, who put out her next two LPs. She recorded the first for the new label in the wake of her sister's death from brain cancer; she'd lost another sister to a car accident years before. That record was warm enough, and cool enough, to nearly obscure the heartbreak writhing just under the surface, but there was a certain darkness to the tracks, a foundational uneasiness, that lingered well into even the ostensibly cheerier Here With Me. O'Connor was dropped by Matador within the year of that third collection; her new record I Want What You Want comes on the heels of three years spent working odd jobs and piecing together a life bungled up by recording and touring (and, well, life) and finds her self-releasing through Kiam once more. The new songs aren't likable so much as largely undislikeable; they seem so unconcerned with anything other than their own gentle resolution that it's hard to fault them for any shortcomings. O'Connor leads each one with her acoustic guitar and her voice, ever steady and sure, and all the other parts are there, solid and familiar-- drums, bass, all marbled with electric guitar. The songs are what they are; they are what they want to be. Each gets its own small, shimmering moment-- an uptick of inflection at the end of a line, a tiny twist of backing harmonies, a particularly satisfying tambourine shake-- which all feel so good and so right that it's tempting to misread her ongoing studies in musical economy and subtlety as lack of ambition and self-satisfaction, just to shame her into something grander. The circumstances of the lyrics are mostly nonspecific relationship tangles, the stuff a singer less acutely familiar with soul-shaking personal tragedy might thrill in stewing in for 40-plus minutes. But O'Connor's songs are not vehicles of catharsis and exorcism so much as of acceptance, of moving on from events already past-- though perhaps not so far gone that a gentle reminder of how to proceed isn't warranted. ""If you make up your mind, you can change your life/ Change your life, change your life,"" she intones, and it's not the first or last time on the record she's singing to a ""you"" that might just actually be herself. (The same subject/object conflation may be read into the album's title.) All the talk of change comes on one of the album's two tracks that forgo the six-string. The other renders the omission more pointed, with O'Connor's opening line-- ""You sold your guitar""-- announcing itself steps ahead of a thunked-out electric piano line, recorded so closely, so nakedly, that the slight stickiness of her fingertips against the keys is nearly audible; a wooden bench creaks as she shifts her weight. It's a story-- maybe her own, again, told back to herself--of a singer, a musician, selling an axe, taking a walk, wandering, caught between wondering what's just happened and what's coming next. O'Connor sings of ""the means and the ends/ Neither of which you can defend,"" letting her keys fall silent for a moment at the end of the phrase, leaving room for a tremulous organ to sidle in, bleat shakily, and shuffle away. The song ends soon after, not where it seems like it should but just about where it started: ""You sold your guitar/ And walked down the street/ Got on the bus/ And went home to sleep/ And never felt bad/ About being free.""","The singer-songwriter's self-released fifth record follows 2008's Matador-imprinted Here With Me and three years spent working odd jobs and piecing together a life bungled up by recording and touring.

BAYTL,Gucci ManeV-Nasty,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c3ea9e61561daa69a4/1:1/w_160/0c0781c3.png,2012-01-05 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16133-baytl/,Warner Bros.,"It's hard to determine what the biggest surprise is regarding BAYTL: that it wasn't a joke, or that it isn't a joke. As far as the former goes: Yes, this thing exists. Gucci Mane, once one of the most prolific and popular rappers in the South, has done a full album with V-Nasty, the Kreayshawn sidekick who's famous only for being a white person that has vigorously defended her usage of, and her further right to use, the n-word. As for the latter, BAYTL is a surprisingly competent and sometimes fun low-stakes rap album, far from the disaster it could've been. Though there are many ways in which the album might have gone off the rails, it's fairly easy to pinpoint why it often succeeds. One major reason is that Gucci and V-Nasty smartly decided to let underground big shot Zaytoven-- long one of Gucci's favorite and most fruitful collaborators-- handle the lion's share of the production. His beats are workshops in space and melody, stretching keyboard notes (that mimic organs) like they're taffy until the rappers have a melodic, yet unobtrusive, canvas to paint on. In Gucci's heyday the two were a constant source of gold, with Zay's production pairing harmoniously with Gucci's playful, inventive flows. On BAYTL, Zay is probably asked to carry too much of the load, and his effectiveness becomes dulled over the course of the album. But allowing him to produce nearly the entire record brings professionalism, cohesion, and coherence to a project that threatened to have none of the above. V-Nasty, for her part, also acquits herself better than you would think. Her voice is atonal in a way that's more off-putting than interesting, and her flow can get clumsy and cluttered at times, but she's more or less up to the task of writing half of a decent album, which is more than you could say for some rappers famous for being actual rappers. She gets by well enough on swagger and brashness, and without the baggage her contributions would scan as acceptingly perfunctory. It would be hard to argue that the world needs V-Nasty's rapping-- and it doesn't, obviously-- but she'll get clowned for being a try-hard white girl when in reality there were at least four worse rappers in XXL's ""2011 Freshman Class."" In a cruel and sad twist of irony, easily the best verse on the album belongs to Slim Dunkin, who shines on ""Push Ups"". Dunkin was murdered in Atlanta last month as he prepared for the filming of the video for that song. If there's anything truly exciting to be pulled from BAYTL, it's Slim's marked improvement as a writer, something that makes his premature death even sadder. As for Gucci himself, he sounds sober and engaged, which is a step up from where he was for most of last year. He's on autopilot here, but he works so well with Zaytoven that the only drawback is that it allows you to dream of how good a full collaborative album between the two would've been three years ago. Gucci's major issue now-- even more than his lost affinity for cinematic imagery-- is that humor and creativity have been all but sapped from his writing, leaving us an MC whose aggressive braggadocio comes off as unnecessarily defensive. When, late on the album, Gucci raps, ""I'm not romantic, but I cook my dope candlelit,"" it's as stunning as if you ran into a good friend you thought you'd never see again. But, just as quickly, that Gucci disappears. BAYTL is a record that, contrary to the hopes of some and the fears of others, isn't a huge failure or massive embarrassment. The talent of all involved-- fading in some, and bubbling in others-- ends up taking control of the sideshow. But with that said, the album, more than anything, is a bizarre and unique artifact of rap music in 2011. It's a record that marks the time when the ""Gucci Gucci"" rapper's homegirl became notorious enough to do an album with Gucci Mane, and when Gucci Mane had fallen far enough to decide to go along with it.","Gucci Mane, once one of the most prolific and popular Southern rappers, has done an LP with Kreayshawn sidekick V-Nasty. Even more surprising? BAYTL is a competent, sometimes fun, low-stakes rap album.

Merry eXmas & Suck My Dick,Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c8c0084474cd0c1ffa/1:1/w_160/dcde7fa7.jpeg,2012-01-05 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16141-merry-exmas-suck-my-dick/,self-released,"So, Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire's new mixtape is called Merry eXmas & Suck My Dick. Because Bad Santa would've been too obvious a title for this raunchy yet immensely likable anti-socialite? Or maybe eXquire likes a non-sequitur blowjob joke far more than the next guy and also needs to figure out a way to create timeliness for this thing, seeing as it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas. Either way, it's a fitting way for eXquire to end the year-- after all, he finished 2011 with a much bigger profile than he began it with, and if this is your first exposure to the guy's work, he got there making about as many artistic concessions as you'd expect from a guy with the word ""Muthafuckin'"" in his name. It's a worthy cause for celebration. eXquire still maintains a huge chip on his shoulder and a related lack of patience for rappers ""doing their best Yeezy rendition"" and supplicating at the behest of internet tastemakers-- a line like ""Books by Marcus Garvey/ Skin swarthy/ Snuff the glitter off your Ed Hardy/ Honey BBQ strips from Hardee's and two 40s/ Bet I finish them shits before I get to my apartment"" from ""The Gold Watch"" serves as a tidy syllabus for eXquire's worldview, equally inspired by time-honored alcohol abuse, budgetary restrictions, and a general disdain for others. But Merry eXmas isn't stoked by the same struggle and desperation of Lost in Translation, and the relatively lighthearted vibe is pretty much necessary since it asks a lot of the listener: It's essentially an outtakes collection from a mixtape, albeit one that, for all intents and purposes, felt like a label-funded debut. Nonetheless, eXquire remains remarkably sharp, taking more chances indulging in pure technical showmanship, celebrating freedom from traditional song structure in the form of 90-second trials on ""What's Beef"" (""Biggie Tribute"") and A$AP Rocky's ""Peso"" (""R.I.P. Payso"", credited to ""one of them A$AP niggaz I forgot""), while a ""backwards"" verse on ""Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's"", double-time flows, and fake patois all fold into eXquire's haughty, smirking, knucklehead voice that finds the missing link between G-Unit and Def Jux. If these really are the leftovers from Translation, it explains why nothing quite leaps out at you like ""Huzzah"" or its remix-- it does reappear in name only as a glassy-eyed reinterpretation that does away with the hook entirely, but eXquire and company make Merry eXmas too much of a blast to really concern oneself with the stakes involved. ""Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's"" might've gotten there had it not been padded out to six-and-a-half minutes by a ""Pretty Boy Swag"" parody and audio vérité from a roundtable discussion of cunnilingus. Those things do have their place on mixtapes, but the decision to jam them right into the most obvious banger is an encapsulation of Merry eXmas' pleasures and faults. There are far more of the former than the latter, though. As if you had to ask, ""Killah Tofu"" indeed samples the Beets (""Doug"" version) and spends the rest of its run time forgetting it did-- pretty much anyone who gets on a track with Danny Brown these days holds on for dear life, but eXquire plays a worthy foil by sounding like the gulliest dude to ever quote Harvey Danger. With beats from the Legendary Mr. Len and El-P, this is still very much in the Def Jux wheelhouse, familiar enough with funk and boom-bap to know how it can be defiled for their own purposes, but also a reminder of a time when ""underground"" and ""backpack"" hip-hop didn't necessarily represent a limp, aggression-free version of it. It's what often has him viewed against his will as a torchbearer for New York-centricity, but he treats it like an actual physical place rather than some sort of mythic construct of hip-hop purity-- he announces ""Stella Artois and sour cream Utz"" as pillars of his diet and by the end, he's probably namedropped 95% of his local bodega's inventory. He's certainly pliable as a voice and a personality, but the lesser experiments start piling up toward the backend-- lurching coke-rap that channels Jeezy circa 2005 (""Nightmare on Fed Street""), ""Drunken Freestyle"" pretty much living up to its name, and the high-NRG booty-bass tribute (""Power U Pt. 2"") that takes a big rip of Boris S.'s ""Don't You Wanna Pussy Ride"" and is the filthiest thing eXquire has put to tape (which is saying something). Yet Merry eXmas can be considered a continuation of Translation in how ""Power U Pt. 2"" completely makes sense in relation to something like the track ""S.C.U.M."" Few artists in any genre, let alone hip-hop, are making rawer and realer breakup songs than eXquire, and ""S.C.U.M."" is his most despondent yet, never asking for sympathy or justification in his actions (""I was numb to the experience/ Jerked my head back every time she tried to give me kisses"").  Sure, on the very next track he's bragging about his ""lesbian broad who only fucks me"" and stewing over an impromptu orgy spoiled by a pal's wedding ring and a Charles Oakley Topps trading card (it makes sense in context, trust), but it doesn't contradict eXquire so much as humanize him as someone trying to reconcile the instinct to be the better man while making and being a fan of morally reprehensible hip-hop. And really, that's indicative of how eXquire's magnetism as an MC is much like Danny Brown's, even though as rappers, their styles are wholly complementary rather than similar outside of a tremendous appetite for women and drugs. You leave their music feeling that there really isn't much of a separation between what they're saying and what they're living.","Despite its title, this relatively lighthearted mixtape has nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas but it was a fitting way for the immensely likable New York rapper to close last year.

Love What Happened Here EP,James Blake,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c09d034d5c69bf4c04/1:1/w_160/e41b8bbb.jpeg,2012-01-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16139-love-what-happened-here-ep/,R&S,"James Blake was such a central figure in the 2011 conversation that many folks lost sight of just how weird the London poly-wunderkind's indelible self-titled debut was and still is, especially as a breakthrough document of underground pop. However, for those attuned to the ever-changing trends of the UK bass music scene-- specifically, listeners dazzled by Blake's phenomenal triptych of 2010 EPs, The Bells Sketch, CMYK, and Klavierwerke-- James Blake's reliance on piano-based singer/songwriter electro-soul perhaps played it a bit too safe, prompting comparisons to the once-outré, now-gear spinning career of fellow avant-crooner Jamie Lidell. Despite a few fascinating B-sides and a particularly challenging double dose of dub released on the reliable bass label Hemlock, this fall's underwhelming Enough Thunder EP didn't do much to quiet the ""supper club"" cries. For those most interested in his sound-warping production, it comes as a relief that Blake chose to close the door on his prolific 2011 with another EP, Love What Happened Here. Undoubtedly his boldest collection of tunes since the minimalistic, spacey Klavierwerke EP, the release features Blake at his most restlessly playful, exploring new sounds and styles while also expanding on his already varied body of work. Newcomers brought in by the full-length will undoubtedly find the tracks intriguing; for the rest of us, it's a reassurance that he still possesses his unique, inventive approach to sound. Even though Love What Happened Here is a ""new"" release, its side-long title track's been floating around the internet since the beginning of 2011, surfacing a few weeks before James Blake saw proper release. Like many others, I first heard it in radio rip form following its premiere on former BBC Radio 1 DJ Benji B's program. The novelty of listening to the tune was enhanced by Benji's breathless recounting of when he first heard the song during one of Blake's DJ sets. His excitement was, and is, understandable: ""Love What Happened Here"" seems to take pleasure in announcing its own presence, as zesty organ stabs unfurl the red carpet down which the track's other elements-- a sharp click-clacking beat, disparate vocal samples, warm pinging tones-- saunter with ease. Revisiting the rip, I wish Benji had quieted down during my favorite part when, at the 49-second mark, James lets loose a tickly, conversational melodic run of tones that sound improvisational-- as if he's caught in a state of pure ecstasy for a second or two before slowly unfolding into the song's light, funky groove. Blake's best work has always been detail-oriented, providing the ability to take pleasure in the smallest things that are or aren't there. Like his ""second version"" of The Bells Sketch's ""Give a Man a Rod"" that appeared on Hessle's 2011 compilation 116 and Rising, ""Love What Happened Here"" is about those small things, stringing them together into a coherent whole that, if put in a particle generator and separated molecule by molecule, would still yield minor revelations. If ""Love What Happened Here"" represents James Blake at his most purely entertaining, then the EP's two B-sides find him at his most engagingly experimental. Like many of his contemporaries in the UK bass scene, ""At Birth"" is Blake's take on house music proper-- only, this is house music done his way, a 4/4 beat speckled with blurry tones and strangled voices, including his own. After hearing him do the straight-and-narrow thing with his distinctive voice for the last 12 months, it's certainly a treat to find him stretching the limits of his own vocal manipulation, especially when it's used in such a haunting fashion. Love What Happened Here's closing track, ""Curbside"", is an entirely different beast and quite possibly the most surprising piece of music we heard from him all last year. Employed in able fashion at the closing minutes of Pearson Sound's fantastic BBC Essential Mix back in November, ""Curbside"" is a seriously stoned slice of beat-tape paranoia, a locked groove trapped beneath tumbling drums, suffocated voices, and pure aural steam. Structurally, it most closely recalls the broken-weathervane hip-hop of J Dilla's Donuts cut ""The Twister (Huh, What)"", and I've heard other colleagues throw out comparisons to the Bomb Squad's confrontational production and the primordial stew of Los Angeles' Low End Theory collective. None of those comparisons are wrong, but they're not exactly right: Both as a standalone single and a piece of James Blake's catalog, ""Curbside"" is entirely, idiosyncratically unclassifiable. Since its title track floated around for almost a year before its proper release, there's been speculation that Love What Happened Here is a clearing-house release-- that the diminishing returns found within Enough Thunder could very well be more representative of where he's heading as an artist. As an optimist, I'm willing to take such speculation as just that, especially since interspersed releases like the ""Pan"" b/w ""Order"" single have suggested that Blake's more about following his fickle muse than adhering to some sort of pre-set career path. Either way, given his still impressively prolific nature, there's a good chance we'll know his next move sooner than later. No matter what direction he's facing, though, James Blake continues to move as an artist, and the thrill of witnessing those movements hasn't dulled.","This three-song EP features James Blake at his most restlessly playful, exploring new sounds and styles while also expanding on his already varied body of work.

Vantaa,Vladislav Delay,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b113d197565213a7f7/1:1/w_160/39554c87.jpg,2012-01-04 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16126-vladislav-delay-vantaa/,Raster-Noton,"It's been more than a decade since Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti, under his Luomo alias, redefined expectations for vocal house with his micro-masterpiece Vocalcity. In the years since, as vocal house has made a comeback in more full-throated, traditionalist terms, Ripatti's kept Luomo shifting, his productions growing increasingly crisp and functional, gradually sweating off the liquid murk of his early releases to emerge as cold and bright tech-house. While Luomo's evolved, Ripatti's other best known alias, Vladislav Delay, has remained devoted to a singular vision of ambient techno and cold digital dub. With few digressions-- such as last year's exploration of acoustic space and live instrumentation with the Vladislav Delay Quartet-- Vladislav Delay's releases have progressed as a series of subtle tweaks and refinements. Ripatti's as studious and attentive a sound designer as he is a reinventer of genres, and though he saves his game-changing leaps forward for Luomo, his variations on Vladislav Delay's themes are immaculately produced and almost as engrossing. If there isn't already, there should be a rule that Vladislav Delay only put out albums in the wintertime. Whether it's the influence of Ripatti's northern longitude or merely a reflection of some internal aesthetic, Vladislav Delay's records give off a distinctly frozen feel. Synths hum and hiss white noise like cold wind, drums clatter like ice or crunch like snow underfoot, rhythms break apart from themselves like ice floes. Beyond the individually chilly elements, there's the overall sense of low light and hibernatory slowness: The tracks play out like a still landscape troubled by only the occasional moving figure. If that makes Vantaa sound more like background than foreground, fair enough.  Yet rather than being dull or inhospitable, it makes for a consistently habitable environment. Some pieces gradually come together-- ""Narri"" coalesces into a little melody, as does ""Levite"", the latter teasing a skipping beat out of its soft swaying keys and evaporative sounds. Others, like the title track, seem to be carefully breaking apart as they unfold. ""Lauma"" might be the most unexpected track, and also the album's late climax, an initial echo turning into a rapid fan-buzzing vibration and then a pneumatic double-time drum figure not so far removed from gabber. While any given moment of the album offers a satisfying sonic foothold, you truly get a sense of Ripatti's skill and vision over the entire course of the record: Hearing any 10 seconds, you might think the stuff static, but Vantaa's glacial movements carve unpredictable channels. In a way, this music is as simultaneously functional and pleasurable as Luomo's more active house tracks, only it's for an opposite function-- and a more sedate set of pleasure centers.","While Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti's Luomo project has evolved, his other best known alias has remained devoted to a singular vision of ambient techno and cold digital dub.

Both Ways Open Jaws,The Dø,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b4ea9e61561daa6989/1:1/w_160/458bd436.jpg,2012-01-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16128-the-d-both-ways-open-jaws/,Six Degrees,"Finnish vocalist Olivia Merilahti and French multi-instrumentalist Dan Levy are nothing if not aware of other pop music. The best song on the duo's debut album as the Dø, 2008's A Mouthful, is a bittersweet rewriting of Etta James' walking-down-the-aisle standby ""At Last"", a take that makes the 1960 original sound inappropriately boastful by comparison-- not least by swapping out the classic song's orchestral swoon for understated, autumnal indie rock recalling Liz Phair, Mary Timony, or Sleater-Kinney. The first song on the album, ""Playground Hustle"", could be described as ""M.I.A. and Kala Down by the Schoolyard."" At Roskilde that year, I saw them cover Cee Lo Green's then-ubiquitous hit with Gnarls Barkley, ""Crazy"". The Dø's sophomore album-- finally available worldwide after being released in some parts of Europe this past March-- keeps up the genre-hopscotching whimsicality of the debut while also urging us to approach music more innocently. The subtle difference is apparent from the best song on Both Ways Open Jaws, video selection ""Too Insistent"": Where ""At Last!"" holds back from excessively gloating about love, this song rejects our advances altogether; rather than smolder with melancholy, it perches Merilahti's elfin coo atop the kind of meticulously off-kilter, orchestral, and kids-choir uplift that makes Sufjan Stevens' ""Chicago"" or Jónsi's ""Go Do"" such hits with movie licensing dudes. The narrator compares herself to ""a tiny toe,"" and questions ""people who act like they think they have seen it all/ They're so indifferent."" She's right and she's wrong; it's often easier to dismiss someone else's personal preference by labeling them as too-cool-for-school hipsters than it is to engage with the possibility they're right. More often than not, the contradictions between the band's knowing appropriations and its calls against jaded cynicism resolve themselves in the album's intricately rewarding attention to rich and unexpected sonic details. As Both Ways Open Jaws traipses from the Tom Waits-via-Lykke Li boho-hobo hoedown of ""Gonna Be Sick!"" to charming electro-folk waltz ""The Calendar"", it makes plenty of detours for unlikely avant-pop percussion and warped vocal effects. There's even another kiddie-M.I.A. song, the tribal chirp of ""Slippery Slope"". On lilting, piano-cracked opener ""Dust It Off"", Merilahti claims, ""Nothing has been before."" Between the elegiac folkie guitars and electronic squelches of ""The Wicked & the Blind"", she adds, ""Forget your knowledge/ Forget the past/ You were somehow born today."" But it isn't that easy, is it? While this time around the Dø have covered another ubiquitous-in-2008 pop song-- Kings of Leon's breakthrough ""Sex on Fire"" in a recent BBC session-- it might be hard to hear the similarities in terms of head-slapping lowest-common-denominator commercial potential. Then again: Both Ways Open Jaws has teeth like a shark.","Finnish vocalist Olivia Merilahti and French multi-instrumentalist Dan Levy's sophomore album keeps up the genre-hopscotching whimsicality of their debut.

Fabriclive 60,Brodinski,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2bf13d197565213a810/1:1/w_160/56fa44ea.jpeg,2012-01-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16132-fabriclive-60/,Fabric,"It baffles me when a DJ receives praise for weaving together different subgenres of electronic dance music. Techno and tech-house? Electro and Italo? Wasn't that, like, the second thought people had after they realized they could mix records? (Somewhere in New York, Nicky Siano is sitting in a rent-controlled apartment spinning Led Zeppelin into Bobby Womack, laughing his ass off.) This dynamic matters, as France's Brodinski is one of a wave of European artists who have come to prominence as much for their mixing skills as for their productions (see also: Jackmaster). Fabriclive 60 is Brodinski's second commercial mix in addition to a handful of downloads, and while it's correct to say that he deploys an array of genres during his 75 minutes on the decks, it's more constructive to think of FL60 as a collection of whinnying, vocally oriented dance tracks that Brodinski meticulously bends to his will. Brodinski has a way with these tracks that forces you to forget or disregard genre distinctions. During a potent three-song stretch, he moves from house (Renaissance Man's ""Stalker Humanoid"") to UK funky (T. Williams' ""Heartbeat [Paul Woolford Remix]"") to footwork (John Roman's ""Petrified""), a game of genre-hopscotch capable of making your head spin. The result, though, isn't discombobulated or showy. ""Petrified"" isn't a DJ curveball or change of pace: It's a siren, because the mix required a siren. An old athletic scouting maxim: Don't tell me what a player can't do; tell me what he can. So it goes with Brodinski, who doesn't look at a track's particular rhythmic and tonal variances as obstacles; he uses a deft hand to tease out what they do have in common. FL60 is as fun and freewheeling a mix as you'd expect from someone who recently named his label Bromance Records. For dance music fans mostly focused on Berlin and London, FL60 is a treat. Brodinski drags along relative unknowns and newcomers like Gesaffelstein, TWR72, and Renaissance Man. Switch and Andrea Martin's incredible, inflammatory ballad ""I Still Love You"" deserves every bit of additional exposure it gets. Brodinski's own remix (as Gucci Vump) of Woodkid's ""Iron"" is a stormy, brass-stained anthem. When Brodinski isn't painting in big, bold strokes like this, he strings you along with righteous, uptempo thumpers from the likes of Instra:mental and Samuel L. Session. Fabriclive 60 features no agenda save perhaps making you and Brodinski grin. It's not a genre exploration (dBridge and Instra:mental's Fabriclive 50, Pearson Sound) or an artist showcase (Omar S, Ricardo Villalobos). It's not even really a ""party"" mix, though you could use it as such. Brodinski isn't as varied and creative a mixer as Jackmaster, but he has an ear for vocal melodies and a healthy lack of tunnelvision when it comes to genres. It's enough to make FL60 one of the series' more surprising, flatly enjoyable offerings.","The French DJ/Justice remixer's fun, freewheeling second commercial mix is a collection of whinnying, vocally oriented dance tracks he meticulously bends to his will.

Purple Naked Ladies,The Internet,by: Carrie Battan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cc9d034d5c69bf4c10/1:1/w_160/768cc6c6.jpeg,2012-01-04 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16145-purple-naked-ladies/,Odd Future,"""When I first started really fucking with Odd Future heavy, my dad was like, 'Really? They talk about some crazy shit and as a female, you're slapping a lot of other females in the face.' I'm like, 'That's what I do. I slap bitches, Dad.'"" That's Sydney Bennett talking from the backseat of a van during an MTV interview. Bennett, whose stage name is Syd tha Kyd, comes up often from Odd Future defenders. As the only female member of the otherwise testosterone-fueled OFWGKTA and one of the few openly gay figures in the hip-hop community, she's often cited as proof that the collective can't possibly be as hateful in practice as all that anti-gay, anti-female lyrical violence portends. Syd maintains a low-profile but powerful role within the collective, producing beats and offering up her parents' home for the boys to record in. Though she stands tranquilly behind the decks during the group's live gigs, her presence is commanding-- try watching her as she menacingly nods along to the beat and slowly raises her middle finger over her head without getting chills. But as a side act dubbed the Internet, alongside Odd Future member Matt Martians, that take-no-prisoners, ""I slap bitches, Dad"" confidence is absent. On one hand, that's the logical result of a bona fide badass showing her soft side, dipping her toes into sounds gentler than anything else in the Odd Future catalog. But Purple Naked Ladies is frustratingly flat regardless of Syd and her cohort's reputations-- it comes off as a demo reel of an act that's still fiddling with what sounds right and what doesn't. Think ""Odd Future R&B side project"" and you're bound to imagine the velvety slink of Frank Ocean's ""Novacane"". But Purple Naked Ladies leans more heavily toward neo-soul, experimental jazz, and funk than anything else. At its brief best-- during its final three songs-- the album recalls Baduizm-era Erykah, soulful and patient and poetically narrative-driven. ""Fastlane"", for example, pairs a steady boom-bap backdrop with Syd's featherlight singing voice as she creates a four-minute metaphor out of love and car traffic. The album's backend is a welcome respite from the awkward instrumental clutter that bogs down too much of the record. Too much here demands fast-forwarding, from the hollow instrumental opener ""Violent Nude Women"" to ""C*nt"", which strikes an ear-perkingly rich note for all of a few seconds before dissolving into an overcrowded mess. Lacking in songwriting muscle, many of these songs sound simultaneously thin and cluttered. As debuts go, it's primarily a failure of editing-- an EP of tightened versions of the record's best cuts would have packed a stronger first punch. Purple Naked Ladies isn't going to do much for you if you closely follow the genres it dabbles in. Like many spinoffs from the Odd Future machine, it's a small piece of a larger puzzle, useful for obsessives concerned with keeping their catalogs up to date. In that sense, it's also a reminder that Odd Future is about strength in numbers, functioning best as a gaggle of goony characters instead of individual breakout stars in the making (excepting Tyler, of course). That's okay for now-- those boys would be hard-pressed to fill Syd's spot if she took off on her own.","The debut LP from Odd Future DJ Syd tha Kid and her OFWGKTA cohort Matt Martians mixes neo-soul, experimental jazz, and funk but lacks the collective's usual take-no-prisoners confidence.

Let's Go Eat the Factory,Guided by Voices,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2bcea9e61561daa6998/1:1/w_160/fb13da00.jpeg,2012-01-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/,"FireGuided By Voices, Inc.","Over the years, there were many Guided by Voices: the R.E.M.-obsessed, fidelity-be-damned early GBV; the high-kicking, hard-drinking, marathon-showing GBV; the Ric Ocasek-produced GBV with those misguided commercial ambitions. But, seven years after the band's 2004 bow-out and a decade and a half on from the peak of their powers, it's the Guided by Voices of the mid-1990s from which their legend truly springs-- all those long, beery Dayton nights with little more than a four-track, a couple 30-racks, and an endless supply of inebriant inspiration. Those few years saw those five knockaround guys wrenching every good idea they'd ever had into some of indie rock's most enduring music: Propeller, Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes, Under the Bushes Under the Stars, and countless singles, EPs and one-offs. That Guided by Voices? They're back. When frontman Bob Pollard retired the Guided by Voices name in 2004, any and all cries of ""why?"" were cut with a strong undercurrent of ""what's it matter?"" At that point, roughly a dozen dudes had passed through the band's ranks, with the Fading Captain himself serving as its only constant. Pollard, in a rare display of predictability, went on to make a mess of solo records with a gang of late-era GBVers; the rock-solid Boston Spaceships, with whom he produced his best hiatus music, found pre-breakup bassist Chris Slusarenko in the passenger seat. But when this so-called classic era band of Pollard, Tobin Sprout, Greg Demos, Mitch Mitchell, and Kevin Fennell splintered sometime around 1996, Guided by Voices changed irrevocably: Pollard's songs grew knottier, flashier, and more professional, with would-be rock star Pollard making what sometimes felt like a last-ditch effort to make music that would place him in the arenas and over the airwaves that his old band had been too rough around the edges to attract. A reunion of that late-era Guided by Voices would've been nice, but it wouldn't have meant much. And, while watching the classic band run through ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront"" to a sea of upraised fists was a thrill, it's that GBV-- with their scrappy, song-a-minute, attention deficient charm intact-- you'd hoped for another album from. That album, Let's Go Eat the Factory, couldn't have come from any other Guided by Voices. Spotty, strange, all short songs and shitty sound, it's got the collagist careen of Bee Thousand and Propeller and the tumbling tunecraft of Alien Lanes and Under the Bushes Under the Stars. Recorded at the homes of Tobin Sprout, Greg Demos, and Mitch Mitchell, there's an off-the-cuff, fuck-around charm to many of its best moments that's very much in keeping with those classic-era records. The songs Pollard brings to Factory hew closer toward his leaner, odder, mid-90s songwriting than just about anything he's done since, and Tobin Sprout has clearly been saving some of his best material. Demos, Mitchell, and Fennell are, as ever, playing with more spirit than proficiency, which, like so much about Factory, is as it should be. Factory, with its one-and-done hooks and jumpy construction, just feels like a Guided by Voices record. For the diehards, little else could matter more. Of the now five GBV LPs from this classic-era band, though, Factory comes up shortest in the song department. Over the years, Pollard's worked most of the lousy melodies out of his system, and though his contributions here vary wildly in tone and texture, he's gotten pretty consistent when it comes to tunefulness. Constancy proves a bit of a hobgoblin here; the more straightaway power-poppers like muscular lead single ""The Unsinkable Fats Domino"" zip by quickly and not unpleasantly, but they feel just a little overcooked, never quite hanging around in one's head the way some of his stranger contributions do. Throughout Factory, though, he seems more comfortable with his refound surroundings than genuinely inspired by them, and his contributions here, while uniformly solid, display only flashes of the one-man hit-parading of his glory days. Peppy lead single ""The Unsinkable Fats Domino"" hearkens back beautifully to the shoot-from-the-hip power-popping of old, while soused singalong ""My Europa"" and stacked-to-the-sky rockers ""Imperial Racehorsing"" and ""We Won't Apologize for the Human Race"" bring the trickiness of his later-era compositions down to the basement-level. But for every sign of life, there's some shrugworthy stuff like the stormy, stuttering ""Either Nelson"" or the pretty but slight ""Chocolate Boy"" to match. And, where the classic-era GBV would stitch together bits of different songs to create a 90-second patchwork of pure pop, those seams are better concealed here, to their detriment. The farty flute kickoff to ""Doughnut for a Snowman"" nods to those sputtering constructions of old, but it feels a bit perfunctory, a sound effect where a fleck of dumbass brilliance like Alien Lanes' ""Hit"" might've otherwise gone. One gets the sense Bob hadn't been shoring away the best stuff like his old pal Toby, and while he's fully engaged with the proceedings in a way he sometimes hasn't been on his hiatus-era solo records, he doesn't come away from Factory with a single tune that can hang with the dozens of enduring toss-offs that populate the beloved mid-90s records. While Bob seems to be re-acclimating himself, Factory finds Tobin Sprout more ready to get back into it. Much has been made of how little Pollard's voice has changed over the years, but then again, he's been practicing. Sprout-- whose sweeter-than-honey pipes and breezy songwriting proved Pollard's best-ever foil. The collection finds him sounding younger than ever, his voice cutting through the din of his six striking contributions. ""God Loves Us""-- by some distance, the set's best-- finds him flipping a Ben Franklin quote over an effortless guitar chug that proves the album's one true glass-raiser; he seems positively energized by the proceedings, turning in fat-free power-poppers and late-Lennon pin-drop balladry and, in the case of the bifurcated ""Spiderfighter"", both in the same song. Pollard, to his credit, never seems to treat Factory like a solo LP with a few old friends in tow, but Sprout saw an opportunity and seized it, quietly stepping out of the shadows and stealing the show. Mitchell, Demos, and Fennell's contributions amount more to vibe than dazzle here; then as now, they'd never dream of stepping out in front of the song, and while Mitchell does get some shine on the Beefhearty ""The Big Hat and Toy Show""-- his guitar snarling around a loopy Pollard vocal-- they mostly just seem happy to be there, glad to rediscover the collaborative chemistry that comes from playing with the same old guys for years. A month or so back, a rumor spread that GBV had once again called it quits. The truth of the matter was actually quite a bit more promising-- they'd cancelled all upcoming tour dates, presumably to work on new recordings-- but going by the breathless reaction to the initial news on Twitter, you'd have thought it was 2004 all over again. If nothing else, all the ""what's it really matter who Pollard's playing with?"" talk finds its definitive answer in the frustratingly satisfying Factory, a record that, if not quite up to snuff with what came before it on a song-by-song basis, still gets along on the enduring brotherhood of its boozy creators. ""It's all taking shape in the room,"" Pollard sings on Factory's penultimate song, and for a guy who's made his fair share of records through the mail, that's the kind of statement of purpose you want him to be shouting. They may never hit upon a run as good as they did 15 years back-- few bands have-- but Factory's a better, weirder shot at it than anybody could've possibly expected. ""We are not the way we used to be,"" Sprout once sang. For now-- and with more on the way-- Factory's close enough for comfort.","The reformed ""classic-era"" GBV have produced an album with the collagist careen of Bee Thousand and Propeller and but it ultimately comes up short in the songs department. The best moments come courtesy of Tobin Sprout.

Tragedy & Geometry,Steve Hauschildt,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a9b1335d7bf169a48a/1:1/w_160/1078a8f7.jpeg,2012-01-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16119-tragedy-geometry/,Kranky,"The music of Cleveland trio Emeralds is pretty wide, both in the range of sounds and instruments they use, and the expansive feel of their New Age-tinted creations. For his first proper solo release (after a handful of low-run cassettes and CD-Rs), Emeralds member Steve Hauschildt took a step in the opposite direction. As he told the website Stool Pigeon, Tragedy & Geometry ""came from just wanting to spend time with one instrument and really exploring all the possibilities of sound you can get from that."" The instrument in question is synthesizer, and the music Hauschildt makes with it is like Emeralds in miniature. He focuses on small, basic patterns that produce two kinds of songs-- slow, drifting drones and pulsing, minimalist loops. The effect can be as big and spacious as anything his group does, but Hauschildt always starts from a base of simplicity. Each track is an exercise in turning tiny sounds and gradual shifts into something large. The lack of obvious variety could make Tragedy & Geometry sound generic, but Hauschildt's devout tack actually gives the album a distinct personality. Choose any single track, and reference points quickly come to mind-- Tangerine Dream, Steve Reich, and various half-remembered foreign film scores and PBS-doc soundtracks. But listen in sequence, and Hauschildt's consistent way with this kind of sound becomes clear, in a starry-eyed mix of small swells and planetarium-friendly wonder. At times the music can get sentimental and even sappy, but it's never heavy-handed. In Hauschildt's songs, emotion feels closer to a happy accident than an overarching intention. This comes across strongest in Tragedy & Geometry's best cut, ""Music for a Moiré Pattern"". At 11 minutes, it's by far the album's longest piece, but it's no grand epic. Though its sparkly loops crest into some moving crescendos, its core is simple repetition and the fascinating patterns it creates. Throughout, Hauschildt deftly treads the fine line between guiding his instrument and letting its cyclical mechanisms do the work. You get the sense that he's basically happy to get out of his own way-- a common goal with anything this mantra-like-- and is as awed by the hypnotic aspects of overlapping synths as the emotional ones. Maybe that's the key to Tragedy & Geometry's sneaky power-- by letting his synths tell tales instead of forcing them to, Hauschildt finds stories bigger than his own.","For his first proper solo release, Emeralds member Steve Hauschildt uses a synthesizer to turn tiny sounds and gradual shifts into something larger.

Grimm Reality,Dimlite,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b013d197565213a7f5/1:1/w_160/ed01bde2.jpg,2012-01-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16124-grimm-reality/,Now Again,"Swiss producer Dimlite and his Now-Again label boss Eothen Alapatt, better known as Egon, clearly function with the same voracious appetite for crate digging. Egon's label has released everything from library music to Brazilian psychedelia, as well as their staple funk and soul-oriented work. Dimlite's prior album, the 2010 release Prismic Tops, worked off the hip-hop template he generally beds his sound in, then guzzled a rich bounty of conflicting styles, all cut together without too many joints showing. Grimm Reality behaves in much the same way, except fuller, faster, brighter, and with even more colors ladled into the mix. It's the best kind of grab-bag pop, where each idea is never labored over long enough for it to get old, retaining the same kind of ADD-infused freshness riddled through the Avalanches' Since I Left You or Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique. Like those records, Grimm Reality is fired up by a constant desire to disarrange, to put everything together then gleefully throw it all up in the air and watch where the pieces land. But that impulse is mollified by a degree of control. Dimlite may take great joy in jerking his audience from Krautrock to funk to candy-coated pop tones, but he's got a way of getting from A-Z that makes it more palatable than jarring. His whimsical approach is mirrored in train-of-thought song titles like ""Blur, Blur, Blur, Blur"", ""Through the Grimms/Stars Down"", and ""One of Uh Infinity's Countless Uh Tiny Cycles"". Anyone thumbing through sleeves in a record store may mistake Grimm Reality for a Liars or Pavement side project after a cursory glance at the song titles, and the music often bears many allusions to rock. ""Pour Some Blood, We Got This"" even sounds like one of the pitched-down vocal experiments Beck was fostering back on Stereopathetic Soulmanure. The use-once-and-destroy approach means we never get back to such terrain, but the strength of Dimlite's ideas make the constant forward thrust worthwhile. When he digs into Can-like bass repetition on ""Blur, Blur, Blur, Blur"" or the fresh-faced, new-age drift of ""Yes, Welcome"", it may feel like he's reaching down into areas he could gouge out a little more. But there's always another twist worth navigating, whether it's through the Beach Boys-like harmonies of ""XY"" or the mutant funk of the closing ""Heroine Roof"". This is multitask composition, where it feels like Dimlite has a thousand different ideas stacked up in his sampler, all begging for attention at the same time. Sometimes his attempt to sate those voices falls flat-- the meandering post-rock feel of ""Healing a Random Tyrant"" lacks the clarity on display elsewhere-- but he's quickly back on his feet with the deliriously spasmodic funk-pop of ""Than Them"". Grimm Reality is an album that ebbs and flows, occasionally slipping into turgid cul-de-sacs (particularly on the malformed bass grind of ""Fridge Note""), but rarely failing to move relentlessly ahead of itself to make up for lost ground. When Dimlite is at his most successful, he's drawing on strands from everything around him at dizzying speed. ""One of Uh Infinity's Countless Uh Tiny Cycles"" is the best example of that, with wild psychedelic organ, motorik drum patterns, synth drones, and a great globule of distorted bass all churned together, somehow making sense in a space where none should be found at all. That track ends in a brief flurry of strings, completely incongruous to the feel of the rest of the track, but perfect as a way to shut it all down. Those kind of spaces are where Dimlite pulls all his strength, in the half-light between sense and nonsense.","Moving from Krautrock to funk to candy-coated pop tones and new age, the Swiss producer Dimitri Grimm's third album features an ADD-infused freshness.

ØØ VOID / The Iron Soul of Nothing,Sunn O)))Nurse With Wound,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b913d197565213a802/1:1/w_160/83439c75.jpg,2012-01-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16130-void-the-iron-soul-of-nothing/,Southern LordSouthern Lord,"Enough with the stopgaps: Since the 2009 release of Sunn O)))'s gloriously oversized Monoliths & Dimensions, the band's principals, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, have kept busy, though not by recording any new material for their drone-metal vanguard. Together, they've reunited their old Washington state doom squad, Thorr's Hammer, for two festivals and another reissue. Anderson reformed Goatsnake for similar treatment while steering his Southern Lord label into the knotty world of contemporary hardcore. Meanwhile, O'Malley focused on rare collaborations while launching his provocative label, Ideologic Organ, with albums by composer Eyvind Kang and Russian polymaths Phurpa. The latest tease is a collaborative reissue between Southern Lord and Ideologic Organ. More than a decade after the release of Sunn O)))'s proper debut, ØØ VOID, Southern Lord offers it again, packaged with a bonus disc of remixes of the material by British experimental masters Nurse With Wound. That same material is available via O'Malley's new imprint as the 2xLP set The Iron Soul of Nothing. If those minutiae seem overwhelming, just trust this conclusion: Sunn O)))'s essential ambitions of grand presentation and aggressive collaboration were intact at the start. Just after completing Monoliths & Dimensions, O'Malley described collaboration to me in terms of the Buddhist concept of the beginner's mind, or of allowing oneself to proceed through tasks without expectations and preconceptions. ""It comes back to working on the sound itself as its own thing rather than having special guests,"" he said. It may be difficult to hear that sense of inclusion and openness on ØØ VOID, which from the first bass moan of ""Richard"" to the last guitar decay of ""Ra at Dusk"" sounds mostly like unwavering and unapologetic drone metal. On subsequent albums, Sunn O))) incorporated noise lords like Merzbow and John Wiese, a women's choir, Hungarian maniac and Mayhem member Attila Csihar, and an army of others. As O'Malley's quote suggests, they all played an essential role in shaping the band's sound at that moment. But here Anderson, O'Malley, and longtime partner G. Stuart Dahlquist-- respectively credited as the Duke, MK Ultra Blizzard, and G:Subharmonia-- trudge through riffs in synchronous, suspended time, making up for a lack of surprises with a wealth of tone. They'd recorded their only previous release, The GrimmRobe Demos, in a small Los Angeles studio, but ØØ VOID was captured in Hollywood's Grandmaster, a high-fidelity location where Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, No Doubt, and Tool have all made records. Sunn O))) have always had a reputation for exacting technical standards and for pushing the limits of their force and fidelity (""Maximum Volume Yields Maximum Results,"" their credo goes), and ØØ VOID offers the first perfect sign of that. These recordings are monolithic, dense, and relentless, even if the compositions themselves sound much as you might expect. There are some allusions to extracurricular influences here, like the ghastly vocals of Scream's Pete Stahl, which circle like ghosts inside the electric tide of ""NN O)))"".  A delicate pluck opens ""Rabbit's Revenge"", and long, thin tones sometimes rise to gird a riff's lumbering end. Speaking of subtle additions, the 14-minute crawl is a cover of an early version of the Melvins song that some have suggested (and others have contested) became 1992's ""Hung Bunny""; listen closely past the five-minute mark, and you'll notice that Sunn O))) seem to have momentarily drafted a drummer and a screamer. It's actually a bootleg of Melvins playing the song, the sample spliced beneath the drone as both acknowledgement and texture. Years later, Sunn O)))'s evolution would come to depend on such outside sounds. But the Nurse With Wound renderings of the material-- lifted from a transfer of the complete sessions by studio wizard Mell Dettmer in 2007-- offer a prophetically revisionist take on Sunn O)))'s eventual incorporation of mostly everything. The icy ""Dysnystaxis (A Chance Meeting With Somnus)"" punctuates a glowing stasis with short bass throbs and softer sounds that suggest Jon Hassell's recent nuevo-ambient riches playing in the next room, not unlike moments of Monoliths & Dimensions. Both ""Ra at Dawn Part One (Rapture, at Last)"" and ""Ra at Dawn Part Two (Numbered by Her Light)"" quell Sunn O)))'s beastly roar into a sort of barely there industrial static, the signal's strength oscillating like the processes of an assembly line. The most typically Nurse With Wound pieces here, these remixes show that aggression alone isn't enough to make something sound sinister; these hums move as though they're alive, each ghastly manipulation haunting the space as if for the first time. But these three pieces are mere curios compared to ""Ash on the Trees (The Sudden Ebb of a Diatribe)"", the real reason this set of reissues is worth the investment. Steven Stapleton and Colin Potter pull Stahl's vocals from beneath the mire, pitting his sneered apocalyptic visions against crests and collapses of mutated noise. It's a terrifying maze of tangents, like the early works of Nurse With Wound cronies Current 93 and O'Malley's own Khanate remixed by some actualization of evil. As O'Malley suggested years later, it's a synthesis that is more about the ""sound itself"" than the special guests lending their name to it.","More than a decade after the release of Sunn O)))'s proper debut ØØ VOID, Southern Lord offers it again, packaged with a disc of remixes by Nurse With Wound.

Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition,Jeezy,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2c113d197565213a814/1:1/w_160/93fa9c2f.jpg,2012-01-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/,Def JamCorporate Thugz,"Once upon a time, Young Jeezy was invincible, a superhero. He grew famous peddling an overblown, over-simplified cartoon of machismo and violence, pumped full of dubious sociopolitical implications and adrenaline. His first three albums were some of the last decade's finest action flicks. The widescreen production, from Shawty Redd, DJ Toomp, and others, furnished the exploding tanks while Jeezy supplied the boiled-down, bumper-sticker dialogue: ""I remember nights/ I didn't remember nights."" ""Who, me?/ I emerge from the crack smoke."" He was Stallone in Cobra; he was Schwarzenegger in Commando. But every decade has its own action heroes. Nowadays, Jeezy is just another down-on-his luck gangsta rapper being jerked around by his record company. Rick Ross is the overfed rap kingpin of the moment; the simmering feud between them has nothing to do with street credentials and everything to do with the fact that in a rap moment mired in varsity-lettered, middle-class nice guys, there's room for only one Rambo. Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition, which has finally wheezed its way across the finish line, is a telling moment: It's a solid effort, but it's also the first time that supply for the Snowman's product has begun to outstrip demand. Nothing much is visibly wrong with Thug Motivation 103. In fact, a lot of it is pretty great: ""Trapped"" opens with a verse from boho neo-soul queen Jill Scott that induces misplaced nostalgia shivers for classic Lauryn Hill. Jeezy sells the hoary details of the song's poverty lament-- no cable in the house, old milk in the empty fridge-- with gut-twisting force. On ""Way Too Gone"", rising Atlanta producer Mike WiLL Made It (Meek Millz's ""Tupac Back"", Gucci Mane's ""East Atlanta 6"") provides a head-spinning cross-breed of trap-rap and cloud rap. The Fabolous and Jadakiss-assisted ""OJ"" provides the extravagant ignorance. All of it is satisfyingly huge- and evil-sounding. And yet Thug Motivation somehow feels both airless and over-inflated, the sound of an artist trying to revisit something gone. In the long gap between this record and 2008's The Recession, Jeezy has done almost nothing to tweak his formula-- a brief guest appearance by of-the-moment ATL star Future aside, there's not much here to suggest Jeezy has been keeping tabs on Southern rap's furiously molting trends, which means even the exciting moments have a certain ""I am big; it's the pictures that got small"" feel. You can hear the lack of organic excitement most clearly on the album's curiously flat Huge High-Profile Hard-Sell collaboration: ""I Do"", featuring Jay-Z and André 3000. Jay-Z hasn't appeared on a Jeezy record since the remix to ""Go Crazy"", and André 3000 guest verses pop up about as frequently as the Northern Lights; the result, however, is shockingly unexciting for the pooled talents involved. For one, the song openly mimics the formula of ""International Player's Anthem""-- ecstatic soul loop, rapturous André verse about marital love-- and baldly copying one of the best rap songs of the last decade is just a bad idea. When it leaked, it was greeted mostly with shrugs and yawns and disappeared into the same, sealed-off rap-buzz purgatory that has settled around other former gangsta-rap heavyweights like 50 Cent. Despite all indicators, and without a chart or street single, Thug Motivation 103 sold respectably, and probably beat his label's projections: 233,000, just behind Michael Buble's Christmas album and Adele. The Snowman will live to wheeze another day. But his aura of invincibility has been punctured.","Though it's a solid effort, Young Jeezy's long-delayed fourth LP feels both airless and over-inflated, the sound of an artist trying to revisit something gone.

Echoes of Silence,The Weeknd,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2be5e6ef95969322347/1:1/w_160/d41b40f8.jpg,2012-01-03 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16134-echoes-of-silence/,self-released,"""Baby, I got you/ Until you're used to my face, and my mystery fades,"" Abel Tesfaye sang on ""Rolling Stone"". It was a surprisingly self-effacing line for a singer whose mystique is a central part of his appeal. And he's not wrong. By now, we know most of Tesfaye's tricks: his choir-worthy voice, his debauched lyrics, and the rich tapestry of synths and samples that backs it all up. His third full-length in nine months, Echoes of Silence, is more self-referential than ever, repeating lines and themes from previous records, including XO cognac (or ecstasy and oxycontin, if you prefer), questionably consensual sex, and self-destructive behavior. It was novel on his debut House of Balloons, but does it still work three albums in? Well, it turns out Tesfaye isn't out of surprises: As his fans now know, opening track ""D.D."" stands for ""Dirty Diana"", and Tesfaye channels the King of Pop with an eerily accurate vocal facsimile. It's an audacious intro even for an artist whose output has already stretched lyrical and musical themes to depraved extremes. The ease with which Tesfaye can shock and awe listeners at this point feels like something of a victory lap. Where House of Balloons was a debut tour-de-force, and Thursday an arduous journey into the internal turmoil of a self-loathing narcissist, Echoes of Silence exudes a brazen, animalistic confidence: The production is impeccable but never showy. The songwriting is tighter and more streamlined. The slinky, spectral ""Montreal"" is the closest thing to a pure pop song Tesfaye has written since ""What You Need"". And his conversational intonation emphasizes the lingering threat that underlies every lyric. In lyrical terms, Echoes of Silence is Tesfaye's strongest work. With a clearer and less obtuse narrative arc than Thursday, the album finds his snaky, manipulative persona at its most blatantly corrosive. Album centerpiece ""XO / The Host"" is a stomach-turning tale of corruption and coercion, featuring one of the record's most uncomfortable moments: After Tesfaye sings of reducing some nameless girl to destitution, the beat goes quiet as he self-satisfyingly mocks, ""And if they won't let you in/ You know where to find me... 'cause all we ever do is love."" It's transparently deceptive, and it slips into ""Initiation"", a cringe-inducingly detailed tale of drug-fueled kidnapping and gang-rape told through the part-grunted, part-rapped exhortations of an inhuman goblin. With drums that stutter and slice more like Trent Reznor than Tricky, ""Initiation"" handily defines what separates the Weeknd from other R&B acts, folding in the post-punk influences, the industrial touches, and that oddly alluring menace into four minutes of captivating hell. While Tesfaye's voice remains the star attration, Illangelo's production is at a high point on Echoes: From the decadent ""Hong Kong Garden"" orientalisms on ""Outside"" to the heart-rending vocal looping on ""The Host"" to the sleepy-eyed, morning-after bluntness of ""Same Old Song"", each lecherous tale is lifted by the attentive and elegant production. Those tiny strokes of detail-oriented genius pull Echoes of Silence from ""yet another Weeknd mixtape"" to its own lithe, cocksure plateau, the same way that the meandering production on Thursday emphasized the numbingly sublime feeling of loss and confusion. A lot has been said of how Tesfaye has run amok with the introspective R&B of artists like Drake and Trey Songz, but the particulars of self-abuse and excess haven't been profiled so intimately or persuasively by any act of comparable size or influence. Of course, all Weeknds must end: producer Clams Casino guest produces ""The Fall"", and his mournful melodies and distorted synths climax in a locust cloud of buzzing and whirring, suddenly rendering Tesfaye's self-reassurances shaky and hollow. The album's eponymous closing track is stark naked, a hospital-bed lament so unflinchingly bright it recalls the Knife's ""Still Light"" in its mournful fatalism. Tesfaye sounds near tears, and as Echoes peters out with his whimpering, ""Don't you leave me all behind/ Don't you leave my little life,"" it's difficult to tell whether he's quoting a nameless victim or gasping the words himself. Those four minutes of unguarded sparsity -- Tesfaye's quivering falsetto and a funereal piano-- unwind 2011's most exciting, conflicting, and self-mythologizing musical universe. On closer ""Echoes of Silence"", is Tesfaye's protagonist finally unraveling or merely beginning anew? That his loosely narrative album trilogy seems like it could begin and end at any one of its entry points seems to hint at the latter. It's a chillingly cyclical picture of decay and self-immolation marking the Weeknd's greatest triumph: an emotional thread so confusing we can love, hate, fear, and be revolted all at once. Tesfaye's recycling of previous lyrics, melodies, and ideas on Echoes of Silence is bound to give fresh ammo to fairweather fans eager to hurl accusations of diminishing returns and unimaginative retreads at the rising Toronto star. But the repetition is akin to devices used by artists as separate as Terius Nash and Dan Bejar, a self-contained world of idiosyncratic artistry that the Weeknd's trilogy ambitiously embraces, rising above the catcalls of inauthenticity and ""PBR&B"" lashed at it from the very beginning to somewhere else completely its own. ""I used to do this for the thrill,"" Tesfaye laments on penultimate Echoes track ""Next"", and even as his world disintegrates into the desolate closer, it's hard to think of anything more morbidly thrilling in 2011 than listening to the Weeknd methodically destroy himself. Echoes may lack the surprise-and-delight factor of House of Balloons, but it's a strong finish to Tesfaye's first trilogy, providing just enough closure to satisfy, and just enough mystery left to entice us back for the next round.","Where the Weeknd's House of Balloons was a debut tour-de-force and Thursday an arduous journey into the internal turmoil of a self-loathing narcissist, the rising Toronto star's third release in nine months exudes a brazen, sexy confidence.

The Award Tour EP,Mike G,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b29813d197565213a7d3/1:1/w_160/2e0d19ea.jpeg,2011-12-09 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16110-mike-g-the-award-tour-ep/,self-released,"Between the books, major magazine covers, pop-up stores, variety shows, and more co-signs than you can hurl a skate deck at, it's safe to say L.A. rap provocateurs Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All's basement days are long behind them. Or as OF member Mike G rhapsodizes on his new EP The Award Tour, ""Went from Call of Duty missions to the center of attention."" It's been a whirlwind year for the collective in general, but between anchoring tracks for Jay and Kanye to winning VMAs, it's easy to forget that Odd Future are largely made up of background figures, all with such varied rhyme and production styles that it can be hard to stand out from the pack. Mike G can probably relate-- his nocturnal flow and a preference for mood-driven beats has left him on the outside of most OF conversations. But still, G managed to find an audience with 2009's Ali, a mixtape that former Pitchfork staffer Tom Breihan called ""something of a lost classic within the Odd Future catalog."" The Award Tour is the midpoint between Ali and G's proper debut, Gold, rumored to be out sometime next year. And while it doesn't diverge too much from his previous solo effort, it's clear that he's trying to make a name for himself outside of Odd Future: Save from keeping the production in-house (Syd the Kid, Hodgy Beats, and Left Brain contribute music) and the occasional reminiscence (see ""Chevron"") or shout out, The Award Tour is one of the rare OF releases that feels purposefully removed from the collective. It's a smart move for someone who has struggled to distinguish himself outside of this growing pop-culture juggernaut, and with his sandy-eyed demeanor, it's a crucial counter-balance to the crew's super-aggro approach. The only problem is Mike G himself. Spin The Award Tour half a dozen times, and it's clear why the guy's so often been relegated to the background. As the cousin of West Coast legend Warren G, it's not hard to imagine Mike's ultra laid-back style being something of a genetic trait, but even two years after Ali, he still sounds like a rapper not only still trying to find his voice, but struggling with the basic mechanics. Maybe it's okay to give Mike G a pass because of the inherent charm associated with his zonked-out delivery, or because his raps oddly memorialize the halcyon days of early Odd Future, but his flow remains so stilted that he often isn't even afforded the luxury of simply blending in. Either jamming too many words into a measure, or too few, he sounds in need of a metronome, his flat and direct observations sounding like unstable free-association raps, when they most clearly weren't intended to be. ""Chanel"" (which finds G in lothario mode) features some chintzed-out Euro-club signifiers which complement his drawl nicely, but watch him peacock by spitting in double-time and getting completely stranded trying to find a way back to his normal operational mode. Most of the time, he simply sounds lifeless and a little unfocused, which is especially hard to take when the content of his rhymes remain so plain and thin. Meanwhile, it leaves his production team to look more like enablers than anything else, offering what sounds like compartmentalized, simplistic, hand-me-down beats that G constantly finds himself inexplicably swallowed by. But The Award Tour's biggest problem? Showcasing buddy Vince Staples for half the EP's 26 minutes. He appears on five of the seven tracks, including the Mike G-less ""Michael Douglas"" with ""Gucci Gucci"" co-writer Speak!, and where G comes off D.O.A., Staples is waiting to step in with personality and rhymes that practically crackle with life in comparison. Maybe he's a bit hung up on the played-out sort of violent juvenilia that first grabbed headlines for OF, but there's something about his verses on ""Vicks"" and ""Award Tour"" (both detail school shootings, suicide fantasies, and Staples' conflicted feelings about religion) that are compellingly reminiscent of Anthony Perkins' chat with himself at the end of Psycho. The demon-exorcising feels authentic and dynamic, and downright scene-stealing when propped up against our host. Maybe Mike G just isn't a show-and-prove kind of rapper, and maybe he doesn't need to be. But you've got to offer your listeners something to sink their teeth into if you're going to follow, ""More complex than architects with any amount of layers,"" with, ""Life's a videogame, I'm controlled by the best player,"" and expect to get away with it. Gold might find G in a more ambitious headspace artistically-- while it sure isn't an engaging listen, there's nothing on The Award Tour that suggests he can't come into his own-- but this EP also seems doomed to be lost in the greater Odd Future catalog. Except this time, no one's going to mistake it for a classic.","On his new EP, Odd Future's Mike G creates the rare OF release that feels purposefully removed from the collective.

Live Music,The Strange Boys,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b299c0084474cd0c1fbe/1:1/w_160/a3bfa3d6.jpeg,2011-12-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16111-live-music/,Rough Trade,"Cleaning up your act is tricky for any fuzz-minded garage band, and Austin's the Strange Boys have been weathering that transition a bit roughly. Their demented 2009 debut, The Strange Boys and Girls Club, combined punk and country and even doo-wop into a bold and bird-flipping sound that proved fast wasn't the only way to convey agitated. On last year's Be Brave, they tidied up their sound and refined their songwriting, but lost so much of what made them strange in the first place. And now Live Music takes them further in that direction, adding piano to their guitar-drums-bass-and-sometimes-harmonica lineup. The problem with this trajectory: Every album so far sounds like a transition, pointing to big things but never quite producing them. The title of the Strange Boys' new album is surely intended to be ironic: Live Music attempts to separate the instruments and create some depth in the production, but it may be the least live they've sounded. Gone is the lo-fi spontaneity and fuck-it-all atmosphere; instead, we get a newfound professionalism that translates to midtempo plods and something like self-reflection. The album is restrained, surprisingly low-key, and-- at its lowest points-- polite. The songs ask for but never demand your attention, then respond with a sociable thank you and good day. Even so, the Strange Boys' garage remains enormous, with plenty of room to stack boxes of honky-tonk, rockabilly, R&B, and classic rock. That inclusive approach has always been their greatest asset and most distinguishing trait, although for the most part Live Music compacts these competing urges into a very generalized Americana that never takes advantage of their Texas roots. They're not synthesizing disparate styles in the great tradition of Austin, but skimming the surfaces of ideas they once explored more deeply. In this setting, Ryan Sambol's voice, which has been compared to Dylan and any number of Nuggets frontmen, sounds more like Tom Petty, but without the classic rocker's signature deadpan. When the tempos pick up, so does the album. ""Omnia Boa"" adapts a train-song chug-a-lug for a subtly menacing groove, and ""Punk's Pajamas"" is a jumble of guitars laced together with a gangly harmonica theme. ""You can study the past or dig the future,"" Sambol sings on the latter, ""but the present will never leave you."" It's a sharp insight that hints at the Strange Boys' goals: to incorporate rock history into a sound that isn't defined by nostalgia or innovation for the sake of innovation. They're trying to find a way to live in the moment, which is certainly commendable. As Sambol unravels that theme across these 14 songs, the album grows more endearing, if never quite exciting.","The Austin garage rockers continue tidying up their sound and refining their songwriting on their third LP, a collection that adds piano and politeness to the mix.

Darkside EP,Darkside,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a45e6ef95969322323/1:1/w_160/9f149204.jpeg,2011-12-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16116-darkside-ep/,Clown & Sunset,"Nicolas Jaar creates slow, strange, cloistered songs with keyboards and field recordings, breath, and drums. He makes synthesizers feel like natural elements, mingled with running waters, murmuring voices, and sighing winds. Jaar called his breakthrough record Space Is Only Noise, expanded on a key track to ""Space Is Only Noise if You Can See"". Titles are often red herrings, but this is the rare case where we might pause and come to understand something essential about Jaar's perspective. No one has found a good box for him yet, likely because he doesn't make a kind of music, but a way of music. (In purely diagnostic terms, our own Mike Powell's ""downtempo minimalism"" is the best shorthand I've read, though it wisely doesn't even venture to address the music's sense.) Jaar's new EP as Darkside, a collaboration with guitarist and bassist Dave Harrington, clarifies things further, but we've got to unpack a little before we come to it. Listen again: Space is only noise if you can see. The nouns and verbs are flashier, but the devil's in the adverbs and conjunctions. I kind of hate that rogue ""only,"" that innocent-faced little ""if."" Does it mean that if you can see, you discover space is merely noise? Or that space becomes noise only upon being seen? And what the hell would either of those things mean? Jaar doesn't make it that easy for us. His assertive yet ambiguous phrasing has no solvable outcome, so it sticks in your mind-- or rather, your mind sticks up against it. And this may be the key to how Jaar's music works too. He applies a chilly, commanding logic to disassociated quantities until they fall into a restive equilibrium. He creates biospheres and then adds one extra, destabilizing element, or leaves out something crucial. His songs pose enigmatic questions disguised as bold assertions. Meaning leaks out of the substance to pool in the cracks, and things that shouldn't relate, do. That Jaar is more about means than ends explains why he's able to transition so seamlessly from dreamy electronic music inflected with impressionist piano, gently digitized French singing, lobby-jazz, and cave sounds to the terse, rugged dub-funk of Darkside, all while still sounding totally Jaar: nocturnal, cerebral, sensuous, paradoxical, and intuitive. (And sounding totally Jaar is a remarkable thing for a young producer with one major album under his belt to be able to do in any case.) The tight, three-song EP, released on Jaar's own Clown and Sunset label, is at once sexy and frigid, cavernous and cramped. Much closer to idiomatic pop than Space, with Harrington's falsetto clenching Jaar's own loose, Matthew Dear-like croak, the EP brings Jaar's highly personalized values to the quality of time, rather than space: because what is funk, if not the creative, slantwise division of metrical time? As Harrington holds down long, deep, calmly needling grooves, Jaar colors the atmosphere around them to give them different senses of brave momentum or back-winding reticence, earthbound heft or atmospheric suspension. On ""A1"", he sets glimmering whorls below the loping guitar and a cushion of static above, holding them in check until the very end, when they burst forth in a high-desert mirage that carries over into the Morricone-tipping ""A2"". It's icy-hot stuff. The importance of Harrington's ace fretwork can't be overstated, but the frosty austerity could only be a product of the curious mind of Jaar.","Nicolas Jaar's tight, three-song EP as Darkside, a collaboration with guitarist and bassist Dave Harrington, is at once sexy and frigid, cavernous and cramped.

Tago Mago [40th Anniversary Edition],Can,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2779d034d5c69bf4b90/1:1/w_160/0f1bc205.jpeg,2011-12-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16075-tago-mago-40th-anniversary-edition/,MuteMute,"Can have long been one of those bands that are more talked about than heard. They were enormously influential on certain kinds of forward-thinking rock artists (their fingerprints are all over Radiohead and the Flaming Lips, not to mention more more recent underground acts like Woods and Implodes); their records have never been out of print for long. But they've got a big, disorderly discography, and they don't really have any signature songs (the Can tracks that pass for pop-- ""Spoon"", ""I Want More"", and not many others-- are alarmingly unlike the rest of their work). They're also tougher to ""get"" than a lot of their contemporaries: They specialized in long, jam-heavy rock grooves, and they had (two different) aggressively difficult vocalists, as well as a guitarist (the late Michael Karoli) who liked to noodle way up in the treble range. So where do you start? You couldn't do much better than beginning with 1971's Tago Mago, freshly reissued in a ""40th Anniversary Edition"" (whose main difference from previous editions is the addition of a live disc from the following year). It's a colossus of an album, the product of a band that was thinking huge, pushing itself to its limits, and devoted to breaking open its own understanding of what rock music could be. The core of Can was four German musicians from wildly different backgrounds-- when they initially came together in 1968, two of them had studied with composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, one had played jazz, and one was a teenage guitar whiz. They recorded soundtrack music and a few straightforward rock songs early on, but what they were really interested in doing was going beyond kinds of music for which they had language. For some musicians of that time, that meant replacing (or augmenting) composition with improvisation: letting the unconscious mind take over in the instant, and recording the results. Can's insight was that jamming alone wasn't going to do the trick. One of their solutions to that problem was that, like Miles Davis' electric group at the time, they were not a jam band but a jam-and-edit band. Their working method involved collectively improvising on little riffs and grooves at enormous length, but that's not quite what you hear on Tago Mago. Bassist Holger Czukay chopped up, layered and extensively reorganized pieces of their recordings (including recordings they made when they didn't think the tape was rolling), imposing afterthought on instinct to create something as densely packed as composition but distinctly different. Their other solution was smashing the crutch of language. After Can's original singer Malcolm Mooney had left the band in 1970, they'd encountered a Japanese street artist named Damo Suzuki ""singing or 'praying' in the streets of Munich"" (as Czukay put it) and immediately installed him as their new frontman. Suzuki is ostensibly vocalizing in English-- the lingua franca of rock-- but English that's either seriously mangled or almost totally faked. Tago Mago is seven songs in 73 minutes; the first half is big-beat floor-fillers, the second half yanks the floor away. For those first four songs, drummer Jaki Liebezeit is the star of the band, setting up rhythmic patterns of his own devising (isolate his part of almost any Can song, and you'd immediately know what you were listening to) and repeating them like mantras. His drumming is actually the lead instrument on ""Mushroom"", which could very easily pass for a post-punk classic from 10 years later; everything else just adds a little tone color. (The song might be about a psychedelic mushroom, or a mushroom cloud, or maybe just the kind that comes in a can.) And his deliberate, crisply articulated marching-band-of-the-unconscious beat is the spine of the overwhelming ""Halleluwah"", possibly the only 18-minute song that would be too short at twice its length. Then the trip turns sour and trembly. ""Aumgn"" is almost as long as ""Halleluwah"" but clammy, deliberately disjointed, and nearly rhythmless; its central sound is keyboardist Irmin Schmidt's repeatedly intoning elongated, mangled variations on the meditative ""om."" Both ""Aumgn"" and its follow-up ""Peking O"" mess with their listeners' perception of time-- everything in them happens much more quickly or slowly than it's supposed to, and as soon as any pattern of sound has stuck around long enough to grab onto, it shudders and evaporates. By the time the dreamy, softly throbbing one-chord piece ""Bring Me Coffee or Tea"" arrives to conclude the album, it's almost hard to trust it not to be a mirage. The bonus for the new edition (aside from a reproduction of the original sleeve, with four variations on a semi-abstract image concerning the mouth and the mind) is a three-song 1972 live recording: something identified as ""Mushroom"" that shares nothing but a couple of lines with the Tago Mago version, a ""Halleluwah"" that fades out after nine minutes without generating the studio recording's heat, and a half-hour workout on the band's three-minute German hit ""Spoon"". It's okay-- they were a solid jam band, and Liebezeit could pull off those remarkable rhythms on stage, too-- but it's mostly interesting for its perspective on how much less a band Can might have been without Czukay's keen razor blade slashing away their excesses and preserving their flashes of revelation.","Can's 1971 album Tago Mago, freshly reissued in a ""40th Anniversary Edition,"" is a colossus, the product of a band that was thinking huge, pushing itself to its limits, and devoted to breaking open its own understanding of what rock music could be.

Lioness: Hidden Treasures,Amy Winehouse,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b29b9d034d5c69bf4bd1/1:1/w_160/aa05a03d.jpeg,2011-12-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16112-lioness-hidden-treasures/,Island,"Lioness is not Amy Winehouse's long-lost gem or interrupted follow-up album, nor is it a revealing view of a tortured star in the fraught final stages of her life. Instead, in true record-industry fashion, Lioness is a collection of odds-and-sods cobbled together over the course of nine years of recordings to create something that kinda-sorta feels like an album. Executive produced by longtime partner Salaam Remi, who helmed her 2003 debut album, Frank, Lioness carries little of the subversive swagger or playful arrogance of the Mark Ronson-dominated Back to Black. Whether it's merely all the material that was left, or an effort to salvage her image after years of tabloid drama and self-abuse, Lioness presents a picture of a talented singer at her most restrained and polite. And let's be honest: Polite is the last thing we expect (or want) from Amy Winehouse. That's not to say the results aren't satisfying: No matter what she's singing, it remains thrilling to hear that voice come to life again. On Lioness, for better or for worse, she takes on the role of standards singer: It feels like a hearkening back to her jazzy Frank days, the result of having Remi at the head of the project rather than Ronson. When it works, it really works: Opener ""Our Day Will Come"" is a gorgeous blend of triumph and autumnal wistfulness, a savvy intro to a record that's bound to evoke emotions just as nuanced and conflicted in its listeners. However, on tracks like ""The Girl From Ipanema"" or first single and Tony Bennett duet ""Body and Soul"", she sounds like a lounge singer, that unmistakable wit and smarmy charm only a faint glint in otherwise serviceable performances. Considering that Mark Ronson-- producer of her signature tracks like ""Rehab""-- is probably more responsible for her fame than anyone else, it's surprising to see his involvement reduced to such a minuscule level. As ever, his contributions are the highlight: A new version of the Zutons' ""Valerie"" turns what was a tongue-in-cheek cover into one of her most infectious vocal performances. Meanwhile, his melodramatic rendering of Carole King's ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" toes the line between elegant and overblown, but better yet it's a shroud of pomp surrounding one of Winehouse's most delicately powerful vocals. When she breaks out into her best falsetto on the track's bridge, it's one of the few moments on Lioness that feels truly, heartbreakingly poignant, enough to cut through its stodgy accompaniment. Winehouse's best material never came from covers or standards, however, but her personality: her bitter sarcasm, her flagrant profanity, and her dominant-but-demure air of not-giving-a-fuck. Even though half of Lioness is by her own pen, it's a different view of Winehouse's songwriting persona: The gorgeous ballad ""Half Time"" is endearing but lacks the sardonic bite of her other slower material like ""Wake Up Alone"" (which itself is included in an alternate Remi-produced version here), and it's easy to imagine the fake-cutesy ""Best Friends, Right?"" being more effective given an arrangement that wasn't so transparently cutesy. Back to Black highlight ""Tears Dry on Their Own"" is present in its ""original version,"" an almost unrecognizably elegiac arrangement that on the other hand not only emphasizes the strength of Winehouse's own songwriting but its diversity as well. Chalk it up to fine-tuned and image-conscious execution, but there's little on Lioness: Hidden Treasures that sounds throwaway, or like it should have never been released; but there's equally little that sounds absolutely essential. Released before the album, the Nas collaboration ""Like Smoke"" seems like an attempt at a new Winehouse jam, a pertinent reminder of her slightly more adult-contemporary-challenging ""urban"" side, the part of her that made her more than just a Grammy-adorned, technically proficient singer. Here the track sounds like a guide vocal, unsure and smothered in reverb, with Nas filling in an excess of white space rather than just guesting. On the otherwise funny, doo-wop-styled ""Between the Cheats"", her detached drawl enters full-on mumble territory, Winehouse sounding like she either can't remember or can't enunciate the words. The chorus of backing vocals feels mocking as a result, but it's a necessary moment of discomfort on a record that sometimes feels like it's desperately trying to sanitize a wild spirit after years of chaos. If that all sounds a little negative, it's because Lioness is still weighed down with the baggage that goes along with any posthumous compilation-- but as these things go, it's a pretty strong disc. It flows well, and if Winehouse didn't sound so oddly neutered on so much of it, Lioness could easily be another solid entry in her catalog. As it stands, though, it sounds like the anachronistic time-travel job it is, going backward through the career of an artist who had a very distinct developmental arc. At least in one regard, Island and Salaam Remi have done the ""honorable"" thing: There's no pretense of artistic intention here, and no exploitative stabs at an artist in the most vulnerable moments of her short life. But in their mission to present Winehouse as a singer first and foremost, whiting out her personal problems and demons-- the very things that made Back to Black such a transcendent album in the first place-- they reduce her to her pre-Black standard of budding talent. Instead of adding anything concrete to her legacy, Lioness only reaffirms what we already knew about her, and hopefully why she deserves to be remembered as an artist rather than a media circus.","A collection of odds-and-sods cobbled together over the course of nine years, Lioness: Hidden Treasures presents a picture of a talented singer at her most restrained and polite.

Dust Collision,Kate Wax,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22ec0084474cd0c1f24/1:1/w_160/6dfded0b.jpeg,2011-12-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16037-kate-wax-dust-collision/,Border Community,"James Holden's Border Community is a label known for its between-genre dislocation, an imprint that takes dance-music influences, warms them over on the stove, and then buries them in fuzzy pink noise. Home to artists like Nathan Fake, Luke Abbott, and, of course Holden himself, it has a habit of drenching techno in longing nostalgia and stasis, music caught in some dimensional rift between dance and pop. It seems a likely home for Swiss artist Kate Wax then, who made her name six years ago on bizarre spoken-word electronica on Mental Groove, but whose sound has slowly gelled into something more palatable, and certainly more traditionally pop. On her first album for Border Community and second overall, Aisha Devi Enz buries herself in a dark, claustrophobic world blanketed with careful textures both prickly and enticing, and tries to tunnel her way back using mostly her elastic but childlike voice. With Dust Collision, Enz refigures herself as an alien vixen à la Karin Dreijier, her intensely smoky sensuality problematized by intense vocal processing and pitch manipulation. Vocals are Collision's key feature, its only constant and the element that haunts its darkest corners. ""I Knit You""-- all chugging but suppressed arpeggios and layer after layer of tweaked vocal gasping-- makes an attractive, suitably weird opener, with lyrics about ""heathen scars"" and carving names into kitchen walls. The menacing verses are underlaid by a catchy falsetto chorus. Even when her vocals are the primary focus, they're still occluded, weaving in and out of each other and interrogating several different moods and states at once. By keeping her untouched cadence in tow (""Human Twin""), the manipulation only serves to emphasize her quavering vulnerability. It's gasping innocence versus jaded hostility, and this sort of dynamic push-and-pull, defines Dust Collision, an album that feels permanently at odds with itself and never quite comfortable in its own skin. Part of that contrast manifests itself in an ongoing duel between the organic and the artificial, an unstable gradient that constantly tugs the album in opposite directions. Moving past the rubbery ""Dancing on Your Scalp"", Collision enters a phase of unnervingly stark sparsity. ""Human Twin"" and ""Archetype"" are driven mostly by piano, relatively simple singer-songwriter material quietly vandalized by synths, metronomic drums, or fits of distortion. It all leads toward the fantastic ""Maze Rider (Live From the Cave)"", an embellished live recording complete with sumptuous reverb, microphone feedback, and Enz's most riveting vocal melody. It feels uncharacteristically natural-- bar the ever-present vocal processing-- and it stands boldly naked at the center of the album, all strong, pure melody with little else to back it up. It's almost enough to make us question whether the heavy-handed effects are necessary in the first place. But when the electronics do return, they're on the fritz-- ""Echoes and the Light"" sounds like it's shorting out with each brutal chord stab-- until the record strips itself down again and crawls back into its pseudo-acoustic cubbyhole, more fragile than ever. (Enz's personality begins to splinter across anxious soliloquies as she cries lyrics like ""mad thinker get out of my head."")  The closer ""Les Djinns"" is where the album's ever-edging tension finally gives way, and the uplifting but gentle melody explodes into bursts of harsh static and guitar moans before just fizzling out. It's just the kind of incongruous and torturously quick ending you'd expect from an album that feels like an hour of emotional infighting. (It's the burn-out of that album, one that exhausts itself trying to express emotions with such an odd and unintuitive palette.) Just as it exhausts itself, Dust Collision can have a similar effect on its listeners. Breathing indulgently in and out without regard for how much space it takes up, Collision takes its sweet time to get its fraught message across, ever a rarity in an age of instant gratification. While her sound isn't quite fully developed yet-- the second half owes a lot to the Knife's Silent Shout-- she's impressively ambitious, toeing the line between two stratified worlds and refusing to give into the confines of either. She can pull off accessibly bare songwriting as well as textural tone-poems, finding formidable power in her singing both when it's untouched and heavily damaged. Damage courses throughout Dust Collision, and it's not the easiest listen, but like most difficult albums, it's eventually rewarding, and her vortex of haywire synths, quaking guitar, and unsettling helium squawks is powerfully magnetic.","On the Swiss artist's second full-length release-- her first for James Holden's Border Community-- she buries herself in a dark, claustrophobic world then tries tunneling back with her elastic voice.

Bambara Mystic Soul: The Raw Sound of Burkina Faso 1974-1979,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b297ea9e61561daa6952/1:1/w_160/22a85192.jpeg,2011-12-08 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16109-bambara-mystic-soul-the-raw-sound-of-burkina-faso-1974-1979/,Analog Africa,"If you're glancing through the CIA World Fact Book, Burkina Faso might not seem to be the most likely source of majestic, electrifying dance band music. It's one of the world's least developed countries, a place people leave so they can support their families back home with the living they make abroad. Its president has his own private plane, but less than 30% of its people can read and write, though a two-decade-long campaign has improved the literacy rate from about 13% 20 years ago. But if there's anything searching for music from around the world will teach you, it's that people find a way. Back in the 1970s, Burkina Faso was still called Upper Volta. The name was a leftover from the country's colonial era, when the French ruled it as part of their West African empire. The decade was a time of relative political stability-- the country was ruled by a series of military and civil-military governments, but they were all led by the same man: Lt. Col. Sangoulé Lamizana. In the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, a cosmopolitan nightlife had been brewing since the early post-war years, and largely through patronage and foreign connections, a few bands had scraped together the necessary equipment to play a modern repertoire of calypsos, rumbas, highlife tunes, waltzes, and foxtrots. The country's fledgling music industry crystallized in 1974 around two Ouaga-based labels: Volta Discobel and CVD (Club Voltaïque du Disque). It's this second label that features most prominently on Bambara Mystic Soul, Analog Africa's first foray into cataloging the little-known music of this landlocked country. Analog Africa founder Samy Ben Redjeb began this project back in 2006 after coming across a few Burkinabé records in Niamey, Niger. He visited Ouagadougou and quickly got in contact with Moussa Ouedraogo, the manager of CVD and brother of the company's founder, Adama Ouedraogo. In addition to extensive interviews conducted with some of the musicians featured on the compilation, the liner notes feature Redjeb's account of his crash-course in musique Voltaïque, as well as a humorously harrowing account of an argument between the Ouedraogo brothers and Amadou Ballaké over how to split royalties from a prospective Analog Africa release. Ballaké is the star of the show here-- six of the disc's 16 tracks feature his booming, nimble vocals-- so the fact that he and the brothers hammered out a deal was essential to getting the compilation together. Ballaké, born Amadou Traoré (his stage name comes from a hit song he wrote called ""Ballaké""), had played in big groups in Mali and Guinea before returning to Ouagadougou, where he became the music scene's most prominent fixture. In his hometown, the recording conditions were a lot rougher than the ones he'd experienced outside the country-- many recordings were made at the national theater and other venues with a two-track Nagra recorder borrowed from the national radio station-- but the rawness and immediacy suits him well. Whether he's being backed by filthy ""Sex Machine"" guitars on ""Oye Ka Bara Kignan"" or singing sweetly over a hypnotic, air-filled Mandé jazz arrangement, his facility with rhythm is astonishing. Ballaké’s international profile makes him an outlier on this compilation-- most of the other artists here have rarely been heard outside their homeland. There's not a single track that disappoints, though. Recording time was a very scarce resource in 1970s Burkina Faso, so bands came with their very best when they got the opportunity, and they were well-honed units from night after night of relentless gigging. Mamo Lagbema's ""Zambo-Zambo"" is a tightly performed, intensely funky workout with a slippery rhythm, deft horn arrangement and compex, interlocking guitar and bass parts, and the recording has amazing depth. It's hard to believe it was recorded live to two tracks. Clearly, experience with this rudimentary recording set-up paid off. This is the sort of release where a review could very easily devolve into a simple accounting of the awesome things each track does-- the way the unique piano part on Tidiani Coulibaly's ""Sie Koumgolo"" bridges a gap between Cuban music and hard funk, for instance-- but that would make for some long reading. Instead, let me say that if you have any interest in West African funk forms at all, this is essential listening. It's also essential reading. The interviews and travelogue are excellent, but just as valuable is the history of modern Burkinabé music contributed by Craig Taylor, owner of the excellent but under-distributed Savannahphone label, the only other Western label to release a compilation of Burkinabé dance bands. A compilation like this may not really shed a whole lot of light on the country the music comes from as a whole-- these musicians were urbanites, guys who used their talent to forge atypical, middle-class identities. The records they cut couldn't be played in a lot of the villages dotted through the countryside. But the music they made was real. It forged a cultural connection to the wider world from a somewhat isolated society, a country off the most frequently beaten paths. The party came to a crashing end in the 1980s, when a series of coups and short-lived governments put a squeeze on the nightlife in the cities. These recordings from the 1970s survived, though, and now we have them to hear again.","Analog Africa's first foray into cataloging the music of the landlocked country Burkina Faso features 16 recordings from the 1970s.

Blue Slide Park,Mac Miller,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b29ab1335d7bf169a470/1:1/w_160/48115b3b.jpeg,2011-12-08 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16113-blue-side-park/,Rostrum,"At the 2000 VMAs, Eminem's performance of ""The Real Slim Shady"" featured him walking across Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and into Radio City Music Hall followed by a few hundred extras that had been styled in his image, bleached hair and all. The performance was an arresting, and very literal, visual representation of the song's claim of there being ""a million of us just like me."" Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller is having his ""'The Real Slim Shady' at the VMAS"" moment right now, even if he'll never actually perform there. There are hundreds of thousands of listeners trailing him intensely-- Blue Slide Park sold just about 145,000 copes in its first week in stores, making it the first independently distributed debut album to go No. 1 in 16 years. And the reason Miller's mass of fans follow him is not because of his music, at least not completely. It's because he looks just like them, because they can see themselves up on the stage behind him, if not next to him. It's a presumptive conclusion, but it's hard to find much, if anything, in Miller's music that suggests otherwise. He is an outsider, but he brings no outsider's perspective to his music. Forget Eminem, Miller's point of view is less unique than Asher Roth's or Childish Gambino's. He lusts after fame, money, and women, and he smokes weed and parties. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that; it is rap music, of course. But it does raise the question of why Miller is so popular, because despite his claim of being a cross between John Lennon and UGK, he's mostly just a crushingly bland, more intolerable version of Wiz Khalifa without the chops, desire, or pocketbook for enjoyable singles. Unless you buy into Miller's persona-- and why would you?-- Blue Slide Park offers you nothing that you can't find done more much artfully by, say, Curren$y. This is, in a way, rap music's fault. Mac Miller has been called ""frat rap,"" and while there's a slight truth to that, the term leaves unacknowledged the fact that frat guys used to engage with the rap world writ large. That interaction may have involved an unhealthy appreciation for Jurassic 5, but it also involved rocking YoungbloodZ and Ying Yang Twins songs at parties. The pop world has left rap behind, save four or five rappers, and it's opened a door for someone like Mac Miller to seize the college-aged, white-male fanbase. If that fanbase is interacting less with rap music, then maybe they've rallied around Miller because he also barely engages with the wider rap world. Consider the fact that Blue Slide Park has not one feature-- not a guest verse or chorus. For a contemporary rap album, let alone a No. 1 rap album, that is basically unheard-of. Before you consider that to be a noble pursuit, the album could've used somebody, anybody, to break up the monotony of Miller on the mic. Miller's world is a hermetic one, and unless it's one you inhabit, the album holds no appeal. It's a normal rap album, sure, but as listeners we should strive for more than a no-stakes work by a guy wearing the same streetwear brands and snapbacks as everyone else, who has merely found a niche and exploited it. Miller's hustle can't be knocked, and it shouldn't be, but his art is 144,487 times less remarkable than his first week sales numbers would have you believe. His success is not a mirage, no. But it is a projection.","Mac Miller's debut is the first independently distributed debut album to go to No. 1 in 16 years, but the Pittsburgh rapper is mostly just a crushingly bland and intolerable version of Wiz Khalifa.

Emika,Emika,by: Jeff Weiss,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b29dea9e61561daa695e/1:1/w_160/b466584a.jpeg,2011-12-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16114-emika-emika/,Ninja Tune,"The idea of a British-born, blue-eyed Berlinite turning Aaliyah's ""Try Again"" into an industrial-dub robot dirge seems pretty suspect. But somehow, 25-year old Bristol-bred Emika pulls off ""Common Exchange"" with flying Grisaille colors. Chalk its success up to the electronic composer/sound designer's belief that life and dance music alike are fatally boring when you stick to the blueprint. Emika's self-titled debut is one of those rip-it-up-and-start-again records. That's not to say that she isn't descended from a tradition of pitch-black and borderless artists, but rather that her influences are varied enough to strand you on Spotify for several hours. There are the obvious trip-hop antecedents: Portishead, the artists on Ninja Tune (Emika's label, where she once interned); there's the THC residue of the dubstep pioneers with whom she's collaborated: Pinch, Mala of Digital Mystikz. Then there are the Bauhaus grooves absorbed during innumerable nights at German techno tabernacle Berghain, where she developed a close working relationship with club resident Marcel Dettmann. If the above paragraph sounds like gibberish, let me re-translate: To the European underground, Emika is a golden child in somber pose. Even the eternally sober Thom Yorke recently endorsed Emika on the BBC and said, ""I hope she gets really famous."" She's not there yet, but it's not inconceivable. After all, few artists emerge as fully formed and self-sufficient. She writes, she produces, sings, plays piano, digital sequencers, and synthesizers. Her old day job was fittingly in sound design for the music software firm Native Instruments. The professional inclination is revealed amidst the poison fog of Emika, a record that's both experimental and precise, well caffeinated and focused, yet always deliberate in its approach. Over the last few years, dubstep has slowly seeped into the bloodstream of mainstream pop. Everyone from Britney to Rihanna to Korn and (maybe) Kanye have incorporated flourishes or wholesale ideas. In England, Katy B is a star, and Skream, Benga, and Joker have made moves toward the masses with varying success. But the pop realm and the dingy warehouse grime of early dubstep have largely been mutually incompatible. At best, they swap melody for rawness. At worst, they boast the street grit of a Flo Rida and David Guetta MDMA orgy. Setting the xx aside, Emika comes as close as anyone to bridging the minimalist menace of the 2005-08 run on the Punch Drunk and Tectonic labels to breathy accessible vocals and classical piano. There's enough violence and double-crossing here to fill up a Rihanna record. Single ""Double Edge"" finds Emika moaning damaged syllables of emotional betrayal. ""Professional Loving"" finds her mulling the hollow, workaday love she experienced at her old office in Berlin. ""The Long Goodbye"" finds Emika emulating Beth Gibbons, wraith-like and ethereal, eulogizing friendships that never were. But at its core, this is about the beats, as silvery and scalloped as a Frank Gehry facade. It's a slippery record, careful to never show Emika's face too clearly. She picks her spots smartly, aware that the mechanized doom rattles, cavernous silences, and multi-mirrored infinity of the production is powerful enough. This is the product of a dynamic and assured vision, one that retains an alluring sense of mystery. No matter how far Emika dances into the light, she never quite eludes the shadows.","The Thom Yorke-endorsed British-born singer/electronic composer's self-titled debut illustrates her belief that dance music is fatally boring when you stick to a blueprint.

HDCD Box Set,This Mortal Coil,by: Ned Raggett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a3b1335d7bf169a47d/1:1/w_160/47475a91.jpeg,2011-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16115-this-mortal-coil/,4AD,"For a while in the 1980s, and to some degree into the following decade, many listeners assumed the London-based 4AD record label was defined by arty goth rock. Bauhaus' slashing, poised aggression may have helped kickstart the label, and Modern English created a new wave hit for the ages with ""I Melt With You"", but after a few years acts like the gauzy Cocteau Twins and the medieval-Europe-gone-global-instruments of Dead Can Dance ended up being the big sellers, especially among those inclined toward pale and interesting looks matched with black clothing. Right next to these acts on 4AD, meanwhile, was something even more cryptic, a band that never toured, that never really was a band at all: This Mortal Coil. This Mortal Coil, the subject of a new comprehensive box set, was in the public eye an encapsulation of 4AD's sound and style spread out over three albums and associated singles and one-offs. And though founder Ivo Watts-Russell didn't want This Mortal Coil to be seen as a label vanity project, there was nothing more classically ""4AD"" from a listener's point of view. Despite the presence of so many performers not signed to the label and the fact that nothing else on 4AD actually sounded like This Mortal Coil, nothing else spoke more to the idea of what the label seemed to be. The band's identity came not from a specific individual person or group of people but from a sprawling series of studio efforts, packaged in moody cover designs courtesy of photographer Nigel Grierson and designer Vaughn Oliver and always featuring model Pallas Citroen, a kind of monolithic, black-and-white take on Roxy Music's own remarkable run of covers over an earlier decade. Producer/engineer John Fryer, Watts-Russell's key collaborator across the releases, helped maintain a mood of poised, shadowy romanticism, part dark ambient grind and part late-night string-laden recital. This approach to production was combined with Watts-Russell's desire to celebrate obscure songs both old and more recent and transform them into something new and stunning. The project offered a mix of familiar and unknown voices and songs, performers sometimes appearing only for a single song, even simply an instrumental (such as Dead Can Dance associate Peter Ulrich, taking a bow on Filigree & Shadow with the percussion piece ""At First, and Then"", never to reappear). The first album, 1984's It'll End in Tears, can't escape being dominated by the group's most famous track-- ""Song to the Siren"", a song by Tim Buckley recorded for his album Starsailor and recast by Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie into a gripping vocal-and-guitar-only performance that has since completely overshadowed the original. First recorded as a B-side for TMC's debut single from 1983, ""Song to the Siren""'s success prompted Watts-Russell to continue with a full-length. It's to his credit that his stated ambition to not simply have a 4AD house band actually came true. The voice of Tears is, if anyone, Cindytalk's Gordon Sharp, ranging from operatic bravura on the opening cover of Big Star's ""Kanga Roo"" to the closing tenderness of ""A Single Wish"". But even that's too simplistic a summary on an album ranging, seemingly haphazardly, from the murky atmospherics of ""Fyt"" to the blunt, mechanistic rockout making up their version of Wire member Colin Newman's ""Not Me"". Filigree & Shadow from 1986 comes across as a more unified effort in comparison, released as a double album and with each of its four sides planned as a self-contained unit, songs flowing one into the other. If nothing towers above the rest like ""Song to the Siren"" did, the tradeoff lies in the record's feeling of dramatic concentration. Something like ""I Want to Live"", a song taken from an obscure 1972 album on Elektra by Gary Ogan and Bill Lamb and given a remarkable reworking by sister singers Deirdre and Louise Rutkowski, can coexist with ominous near-industrial level pieces like ""A Heart of Glass"" and ""The Horizon Bleeds and Sucks Its Thumb"". Yet it all works in the end, from fragile strings on another Newman cover, ""Alone"", to the dark funk guitar on Talking Heads' ""Drugs"", and no one song moment can fully convey the record's range. Blood, another double-album release rom 1991, feels in retrospect like the ending of multiple eras, with 4AD about to open L.A. offices and a new decade about to embrace homegrown noise. But in some ways this felt like the most American record they'd done yet, given cover choices like Spirit, the Byrds, and Emmylou Harris via Rodney Crowell (not to mention a return of sorts to Big Star via Chris Bell's ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You and Your Sister"", the latter featuring a duet between Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly). Listening to it again in a time when styles are so easily appropriated, it's actually shocking to hear a band approach those sources so intent on reinterpreting them in their own image. From the opening original ""The Lacemaker"", all strings, echoes, and tones, to the slow stomp and grind of ""Ruddy and Wretched"" and a delicate version of Mary Margaret O'Hara's ""Help Me Lift You Up""-- and even the almost light breakbeats of ""Loose Joints""--  it's another catch-all that holds together. This collection is the second time that the three albums have been presented in a box set-- the first time, in 1993, included a fourth disc that featured the original versions of the many songs that TMC covered. Besides updated remastering and a new overall presentation, there's a new fourth disc here, Dust and Guitars, consisting of those previously mentioned non-album releases, including the ""16 Days/Gathering Dust"" medley from their first single, two unreleased songs from a planned 1992 Rough Trade single, and various single remixes. When those original songs TMC reworked can now be easily put together on a playlist via YouTube or Spotify, the actual physical sight of this comprehensive set helps reinforce what made this project special. It feels like one last nod toward the idea of 4AD-as-artistic-construction, a final opportunity for something a little more permanent.","4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell's This Mortal Coil-- a band that never toured, that never really was a band at all-- is the subject of this comprehensive box set, one that offers remastered versions of their three LPs along with a fourth disc consisting of non-album tracks.

So Many Things,Eddy Current Suppression Ring,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2969d034d5c69bf4bc5/1:1/w_160/6d3f7091.jpeg,2011-12-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16106-eddy-current-suppression-ring-so-many-things/,Goner,"The story goes that the members of Eddy Current Suppression Ring decided to form a band during a drunken jam at an office Christmas party. The ""office"" in that scenario was the Corduroy Records vinyl pressing plant in Australia. The story's captured on their first song, 2003's ""So Many Things"", a track with ragged, propulsive energy; a juvenile sense of humor; sloppy vocals; and a loud, meandering organ. It sounds like the sort of in-the-moment jam that could pop up at any work party-- people have clearly been drinking; the lyrics are frontman Brendan Suppression's bitter rambling about a woman: ""I think about you here and there/ Only because you're a dickhead"" and ""I don't need your boobies/ I don't need your cute little bum."" It's a rough artifact of their first foray in making music. It's also the opening track on the band's new Goner-imprinted singles compilation, which naturally teases out ECSR's chronological trajectory through B-sides and singles. Since So Many Things shows the group from its inception to the present, it's safe to assume it illustrates some sort of growth. A quick comparison between tracks one and 22 suggest that's probably the case: 2010's ""Rush to Relax"" has markedly better production and displays a bit more patience and maturity in the band. And, throughout the collection, you can hear a more well-defined guitar sound from Eddy Current and more assertive vocals from Suppression. But they never stop having fun-- their sloppy cover of the Go-Go's ""We Got the Beat"" from a 2011 Record Store Day split 7"" on Trouble in Mind proves that. The band sounds reckless in their approach, singing completely off beat (pun probably intended), like they're having just as much fun as they were at the 2003 Corduroy Christmas party. That's probably the best thing about So Many Things-- it's a document of four dudes having a good time over the course of about six years. Of course, it's not all drunken staggering through silly jams-- there's plenty of ripping punk and reasonably weighty stuff here. ""You Let Me Be Honest With You"", from their 2008 LP Primary Colours, has a two-guitar barrage, undercut by Suppression's monotonous vocals. In several songs-- especially ""Honest"" and ""It Ain't Cheap""-- his voice sounds a lot like Iggy Pop's on early Stooges records. They've got a cover of ""T.A.L.O.I.G.A."" by Australian punks the Chosen Few, which has Current attacking a dissonant, screaming guitar solo. Then there's ""Iraq (It's on the Map)"", driven by a militaristic snare and that states, matter-of-factly, ""people are dying from west to east."" Their bass gets guttural and their guitars get frantic on ""Demon's Demands"". They do menace well, something that probably comes from the band's obsession with punk. (Also, drummer Danny Current used to be in a grindcore band called Demonother.) But even when they crank up the distortion, they don't stray too far from their biggest strength-- these guys really are a lot of fun. ""Hey Mum"" is especially awesome-- a two-minute, jumpy, hokey Hallmark card to a mother. The best part about it? It's still a damn fine punk song. Their growth is most apparent, though, in their musicianship. Even on the shortest song of the bunch, ""Through the Trees"", there's subtle, intricate guitar work from Current that weaves between a harmony line and staying in unison with Suppression's vocals. Sure, Eddy Current Suppression Ring are still the goofy drunks from the record plant, but as musicians, they're capable of elegant, well done rock'n'roll.","This compilation-- a document of four dudes having a good time over the course of six years-- teases out the Australian punk-loving rock band's trajectory through B-sides and singles.

The Roy Tapes,Wives,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28bb1335d7bf169a454/1:1/w_160/f77e3340.jpeg,2011-12-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16101-wives-the-roy-tapes/,Post Present Medium,"Before they morphed into sampler-toting, vaguely psychedelic dream-punks, No Age's Dean Spunt and Randy Randall were plain-old punks, bashing out noisy, art-damaged songs in Wives. A trio, rounded out by drummer Jeremy Villalobos and, later, Roy Tatum, Wives emphasized passion over precision. The band took its basic inspiration from 1980s hardcore bands like Void, but amped up the freak-out factor with explosive bursts of noise and out-crowd abstraction. Formed in 2001, they delivered a handful of 7"" singles and the Erect the Youth Problem LP before Spunt and Randall laid the name to rest. You can still catch a clip of their final gig, performed as a duo, on the 2006 documentary 40 Bands/80 Minutes. Released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Spunt's label, PPM, The Roy Tapes are Wives' last gasp, seven songs recorded immediately prior to the band's first and final European tour, then shelved for nearly seven years. As lost albums go, it's not quite Smile or Black Album-grade myth-fodder. It's a slight, unlabored collection of tunes-- 10 minutes of shrill feedback and growl, preserving the last handful of tunes the band wrote, plus one Negative Approach cover (""Can't Tell No One""). If you caught them in 2005, it will set off an immediate, tender pang of nostalgia. But there's historical value, too-- if only because you can hear the early percolation of the ideas that would drive No Age. On The Roy Tapes, Spunt and Randall's songwriting takes a step back from the abstract and brainy turf that Wives staked out on their debut. The songs are clumsier in execution, but more hummable. Instead of a tool to voice agression and anger, noise becomes a more melodic and textural element, playful instead of pumelling. On ""If You Went Any Lower You'd Hit China"", the trio rides a simple singsong guitar hook through a wave of electronic squealing, tumbling into a primitive rave up. The Roy Tapes isn't Wives' finest hour-- Erect the Youth Problem is a more fully realized effort and, if you keep an eye out, it's not that hard to find it in the cut-out bin-- but it's an admirable testament to Spunt and Randall's stick-to-it-iveness at a time when their band was very much in flux. In No Age, Randall and Spunt would hit on a brand of positive punk that was explosive and emotionally direct, but never tear-streaked or tedious. If nothing else, Wives were the first step toward bigger things.","Before No Age, Dean Spunt and Randy Randall played in Wives. Released on the 10th anniversary of Spunt's label, The Roy Tapes are seven songs recorded prior to the trio's first and final European tour.

Campus Martius,Keep Shelly in Athens,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b287ea9e61561daa6937/1:1/w_160/c1fa3605.jpeg,2011-12-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16099-campus-martius/,Planet Mu,"You'd be forgiven for thinking Planet Mu is all about twitchy, high-tempo music these days, given prominent albums from Machinedrum and Kuedo, not to mention their ongoing documentation of the Chicago footwork sound that influences those artists. But over the past two years, the English label has placed just as much stock into warmed-over and vaguely nostalgic sounds, riffing off of chillwave and hypnagogic pop but dressing it all up in beat-oriented structures compatible with the UK bass dialogue that Planet Mu otherwise engages with. Artists like Boxcutter, Solar Bears, Oriol, Tropics, and even FaltyDL have all swum down this lukewarm stream of lazy watercolor, and the label ends one of its best years ever with its first release by Greek duo Keep Shelly in Athens. Making their first appearance on Mu with a remix of fellow dream-popper Tropics, the lead track off of their first solo EP is also a remix. If this move seems a little disingenuous at first-- is their own material just not up to snuff?-- it's easy to understand why once you actually play the thing. Solar Bears' original ""Cub"" was one of their album's more wandering pieces, three minutes of spidery guitar and mellotron, vaguely medieval in its execution. But in Keep Shelly in Athens' hands, it's an achingly poignant quiet-stormer. Unravelling and pitch-bending that guitar riff to queasy extremes, the duo pushes a staggered beat underneath it, along with its usual assortment of wafting vocal samples. Once the drop hits, it pushes forward with a surprising momentum: Spiraling down a vortex of intense color, ""Cub"" is a misty rush of twinkling synths and adult-contemporary vocals molded into wordless but heart-tugging shapes. It's a hell of an introduction, and it sets up the band for high expectations on their original material. They deliver as well as anyone could expect such a young band to: ""The Chains"" throws a foundation of rolling basslines and taut percussive loops underneath frontwoman Sarah P's soft vocals, and suddenly bursts into a clangorous, banging echo chamber where drums ominously beat in a pseudo-dubstep pattern. It's a tantalizing 20 seconds that never gets less startling or less powerful, and the duo throws those lurching beats all over ""Struggle With Yourself"", where Sarah P's vocals merge with the humid and cloudy backdrop, and the drums glitch, catch, and screech rudely underneath. The surprisingly nasty underbelly keeps the otherwise lightweight songs from floating away completely, and offers a tangible undercurrent separating them from a legion of anodyne dream-pop acts all singing the same pleasantly slurred tune. The EP's only uncertain moment comes with its title track, which pairs an awfully saccharine piano motif over erratically sliced percussion, a tension between the beautiful and the berserk that recalls Kuedo's majestic Severant only without the careful balance of melodrama and grit. But even here, vocals gently ride the beat with a supple propulsion that, just like on their remix of ""Cub"", proves addictive and persuasive without predictability. They're still dealing with the unassembled spare parts of what sounds like could be a tight, confident outfit, but the configurations they try on here are promising and at the least intriguing. They might not have answered the question of what exactly separates them from the bleary-eyed masses, but considering the caliber of the artists they're now mingling with on Planet Mu, the possibility for nurturing artistic growth seems high. One's thing for sure: They do one hell of a remix.","The Greek dream-pop duo opens its first Planet Mu EP with an excellent Solar Bears remix that sets up high expectations for the band's original material.

Stage Whisper,Charlotte Gainsbourg,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27fea9e61561daa692e/1:1/w_160/366c8d03.jpeg,2011-12-07 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16094-stage-whisper/,ElektraBecause,"Charlotte Gainsbourg has been in the public eye for most of her life. She's been acting since she was 13, and the first glimmers of her parallel musical career date to the same year, when she dueted with her father, Serge Gainsbourg, on a song called ""Lemon Incest"". He produced her first album two years later, in 1986, but she left music alone for more than a decade after that, and didn't pick up her solo career again until 2006. I don't know the reasons for the long pause, but I do think that waiting so long to restart her singing career allowed her to create distance between her own identity as a performer and an identity guided by her father. In Air, Jarvis Cocker, and more recently, Beck, she found collaborators who could pitch material perfectly for her-- she doesn't project a huge personality on her records, but she sounds at home in the paleofuturistic musical worlds of her albums, calmly detailing airplane crashes, medical procedures, and a long catalog of ruminations on mortality. Gainsbourg had her third child earlier this year, which makes the time ripe for a gap-filling release of some sort, and Stage Whisper fills that bill, splitting itself between live recordings of songs from her two most recent LPs, IRM and 5:55, and unreleased studio tracks. Both sections of the record pick up the thread Gainsbourg began unraveling with Beck on IRM. The songs from that album are put forth in all their buzzy glory, with the emphasis on the most kinetic tracks: ""IRM"", ""Trick Pony"", and ""Voyage"" are all among the highlights. The relatively smooth edges of the 5:55 material are hammered a little rougher by her touring band. The Cocker-penned ""Set Yourself on Fire"" sounds great with a generous helping of fuzz guitar muddying the hook. Gainsbourg's ability to blend into her audio environments is usually an asset on her albums, but on the live recordings it means she doesn't really command the spotlight-- the performance is fine, but there aren't any revelations in her on-stage readings of the material. As if to emphasize the point, the worst thing here is easily the sleepy cover of Dylan's ""Just Like a Woman"", which seems to rest entirely on the premise of a gender switch by the singer, a switch that's not compelling on its own. The new energy heard in some of these songs comes from the revamped arrangements, and listening to the live songs is essentially the same as listening to studio recordings-- the presence of an audience doesn't seem to change her performance dynamic. The new studio material mostly builds directly on IRM. ""Terrible Angels"", produced by Beck, is a buzzing, fizzy concoction not far outside the realm of what Broadcast were doing prior to the death of Trish Keenan, though it's not as unstable. It has that same effect of sounding like the past and the future at once, though. Gainsbourg has the perfect cold, even vocal tone for electro-pop, and a few of these songs go there. ""All the Rain"" is a nice cousin to ""Trick Pony"", and ""Paradisco"" makes good use of her soft voice against a hard beat. On the whole, Stage Whisper is enjoyable, but the live portion is dispensible, and the new studio tracks, which will likely please anyone taken with IRM, are the real draw.","This 2xCD splits itself between live recordings of songs from the French singer's most recent LPs and unreleased studio tracks, including two songs with Beck.

Second Annual Report / D.O.A. / 20 Jazz Funk Greats / Heathen Earth / Greatest Hits,Throbbing Gristle,by: Drew Daniel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28eb1335d7bf169a45c/1:1/w_160/24fdf2eb.jpeg,2011-12-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/,IndustrialIndustrial,"""Yea yea twist again better than we did last summer, laughing in the face of all rock and roll historians collectors revivalists purists inquisition members puritans bores creeps and not forgetting the fussy midgets with obscene hairdos."" So wrote Claude Bessy in the liner notes to Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits, one of the five classic Throbbing Gristle albums Industrial Records have just reissued, and which now sit upon my desk, uncanny and accusatory, over 30 years after that pre-emptive fit of snark. Throbbing Gristle were never meant to be reliable, but here they come again, ready to be harvested by the very culture industry they alternately solicited and spat upon so long ago. Permit me to adjust my obscene hairdo and offer those of you not already in the know some history: In their first incarnation as the Death Factory, they were the house band for Coum Transmissions, an abject performance-art troupe whose presentation of used tampons, anal syringes, and pornography featuring band member Cosey Fanny Tutti in the ICA gallery for their ""Prostitution"" show in 1976 earned them tabloid infamy and denunciations in Parliament as ""wreckers of civilization."" So far, so punk. But the music of the Death Factory, soon re-named Throbbing Gristle after a Yorkshire slang term for an erection, was a horse of a different color: ""industrial music for industrial people,"" a dystopian, negative form of what the band itself called ""post-psychedelic trash."" While the rest of the Class of '77 pogoed steadily, Throbbing Gristle blew hot and cold, a passive-aggressive tug of war between the sharp and the slimy: The formal elegance of Chris Carter's synthesizers are scrawled upon by Genesis P-Orridge's bass riffs and Cosey Fanni Tutti's fuzz guitar freakouts, spiced with violin and dubby honks of cornet. This already pungent stew is spiked with taped material selected by Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- excerpts of everyday intimacy and true crime verité-- and the arsenic tang of Genesis' vocals, either sung in a soft sort of sprechstimme or howled into effects. On their debut, The Second Annual Report, the music alternately chugged along like a squelchy, crude cop of the Velvet Underground, or stretched out into malingering new age, like a syphilitic Tangerine Dream. But they got both more virulent and more ambitious with time, upping the hostility and dread on D.O.A, taking a kitsch detour toward mutant disco on 20 Jazz Funk Greats, auto-cannibalizing their catalog in the live-in-the-studio ritual recording of Heathen Earth, and reasserting a strangely forceful collection of avant garde anti-pop for a Greatest Hits package revealingly subtitled Entertainment Through Pain, which collates their singles output as a quiver of tense stabs at accessibility. In time for Christmas, a revived Industrial Records has just re-released all five of these classic albums, lovingly repackaged in deluxe gatefolded 2xCD editions. In each case, the original album is (wisely) preserved intact on one CD, while a second CD collects period singles, live performances, and a smattering of alternate mixes and unreleased material. Artwork is supplemented with alternate takes from photo-sessions, and it's a jarring experience for collector scum like myself to see and hear these goofy blooper reels and deleted scenes, in which the avatars of colder-than-thou aesthetics stand on one foot or giggle. Savvily recognizing the waning moment of the CD as such, there are vinyl editions of the albums too, which faithfully reprint the original artwork at full size and format. While so far I've only checked out the vinyl for 20 Jazz, it looks drool-worthy and sounds far stronger than any other pressing that this fussy midget has encountered. Given that these albums have stayed continuously in print for years through arrangements with Fetish Records, and later Mute, one must ask: Why bother paying attention to these reissues? In a triumphant vindication of sound over image, the real motivation for this re-presentation of a back catalog is that all five of these five albums have been remastered by Chris Carter himself, a labor of obsessive-compulsive love whose consequences I intend to unpack, album-by-album, below. On the face of it, the idea of an ""audiophile TG"" makes for a jarring proposition: The band always seemed weirdly proud of the dismal fidelity of its early recordings, and its stated objective was to be repellent and un-assimilable. As an early Coum Transmisions slogan put it, ""We Guarantee Disappointment."" However off-message, the immersive experience of these new versions redeems what might sound gratuitous, or merely greedy, about this gambit. It's the audio equivalent of a ""director's cut"" edition of a beloved series of seedy cult movies, something to file between your Kenneth Anger boxset and a Hermann Nitsch coffee-table tome. Assessed as an archival work of restoration, it's a bullseye. I've been listening to these records for 25 years, and for me, this feels like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, if the Sistine Chapel were painted by Hieronymous Bosch instead of Michelangelo. Simply put, the heat and noise and grit and dirt and gristle is still there, but Chris Carter has finally put meat on the bones. There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today. SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Recorded in their rehearsal space and at various grubby gigs onto a Sony cassette recorder in a defiantly lo-fi manner in 1977, Second Annual Report makes an oddly recalcitrant candidate for a remastering job. Music this deliberately weedy was never going to please audiophiles, and the wags at Industrial Records know that even today this record is a tough sell. For sheer sangfroid, it's hard to beat a press sheet that boasts, ""Contains three different versions of 'Slug Bait', a song about eating a baby."" Talking about killing people isn't necessarily interesting (hello, Foster the People), but when I hear Genesis P-Orridge describe a businesslike psychopath butchering a family (""I cut his balls off with my knife (KNIFE); I make him eat them right there in front of his pregnant wife (WIFE)""), I still blink and twitch a little. The creeping dread ""Slug Bait"" achieves lies not in the lyrical body count but in the hiccupping repetition of trigger words as Gen's vocal longjumps from a casual speaking voice to a garbled shriek, and in the deliberate misfit between the vocal's desperation and the detuned pastoral synths smeared underneath. It's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of ""Industrial"" subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for Wolf Eyes, Brainbombs, Prurient, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, Second Annual Report counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film ""After Cease to Exist"". Which is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age (take a bow, James Ferraro), a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years. D.O.A.: THE THIRD AND FINAL REPORT OF THROBBING GRISTLE Widely regarded as the band's finest hour, 1978's D.O.A. effortlessly surpasses Second Annual Report both in its ballsy, forceful execution and its passionate range. If TG are Fleetwood Mac, then D.O.A is their Rumors: the sound of a band alchemically transforming romantic upheaval into their sharpest statement. In a proggy gambit worthy of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, D.O.A. explodes the idea of a unified album into a suite of collective songs punctured by four solo pieces from each band member. Sleazy's ""Valley of the Shadow of Death"" is a fetishistic fly-on-the-wall compilation of working-class men and boys talking shit, a sonic file folder of vanished moments that are naggingly unclear (Chit chat? Hustling?). Gen's melancholic pleading on his solo effort ""Weeping"" couldn't be further from the tranquility of Cosey's idyllic ""Hometime"", and this polar juxtaposition flags the album's messy personal backstory (the album was recorded after Gen and Cosey's ongoing romance imploded, and Chris and Cosey's lifelong partnership began). But the standout solo track is surely Chris Carter's celestial arpeggio staircase ""AB/7A"", a clear influence upon the now-much-imitated Emeralds aesthetic of heart-tugging synth mandalas. Counterbalancing these solitary excursions, the group efforts on this album are exhilaratingly bleak: From the chemtrails of distortion on ""Hit By a Rock"" to the amplified sound of early computer code stored on cassette on ""I.B.M."" to the final raveup of ""Blood on the Floor"", it's never less than car-crash fascinating. At the center of the record is ""Hamburger Lady"", a nightmarish vision of a burn victim's excruciatingly prolonged survival in the administered world of a high-tech hospital. It's probably Throbbing Gristle's greatest song, and it sounds tougher and more menacing than ever. The re-mastering has put a bass-jeep-worthy oomph into the low end of the kick drum, thickened the seasick, doomy bass dirge that, yes, throbs at its heart, and sharpened the edge of the scything central riff, a party horn run through a custom-built effects unit called the Gristleizer. Witch-house wishes it were this creepy, but even upside-down crosses won't save you from the horror of everyday life. A nauseating masterpiece, and an essential recording. 20 JAZZ FUNK GREATS You could write an entire book about the sly wit and polymorphous slipperiness of 20 Jazz Funk Greats, whose kitsch seaside holiday photo on notorious suicide spot Beachy Head tips off the viewer to the deliberately fishy insincerity of its sonic contents. In a smash and grab that testifies to both increased musical ambition and a relentless urge to wrongfoot audience expectations, 20 Jazz Funk Greats finds the band waking up from D.O.A's dark night of the soul and feeling curiously frisky. Snacking on not only the titular funk and jazz, the band also takes touristic zig zags through exotica, rock, and disco. Like the alien mimic in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film ""The Thing"", each song seems almost persuasive as a stab at these genres, but crucially twists itself out of alignment in a perverse reveal. ""Hot on the Heels of Love"" is a delirious slice of Moroder-esque boudoir-disco complete with breathy vocals from Cosey and, thanks to the remastering, a floor-filling low-end thump. The blueprint for 100% Silk's hipster-house shenanigans arguably starts here, with people who have no business taking over the dancefloor doing it anyway, with surprisingly solid results. An even stronger case for the critical re-thinking that mastering can achieve, ""Convincing People"", which has previously struck me as a less-than-successful stab at a cynically collapsed political anthem, now sounds suitably fist-pumping. But the standout moment here is still ""Persuasion"". Handcuffed to a plodding, two-note bass figure, Gen croons a narrative of pornographic photography sessions, which is punctured by squealing shards of Cosey's guitar and deeply unnerving tapes of unidentifiable people in compromising situations that seem to mingle distress, ecstasy, and pain. Tilting a repellent and yet seductive purr against found audio fragments, it's as if the crew of ""To Catch a Predator"" arrived too late to stop the Drake of ""Marvins Room"" from making a snuff film: once encountered, you can't hit undo. But as much as TG tried to deliberately ""guarantee disappointment"" and mutate away from any signature, certain gestures had started to recur: ""Six Six Sixties"" ends this album in the riff rock grind-mode just as ""Blood on the Floor"" ended D.O.A. Patterns had begun to emerge, and the cumulative pressure of their own survival now forces the band members to work harder to surprise themselves. It's in the pathos of their promiscuous liasons with the forbidden territory of various forms of ""real music"" that this album generates a weirdly gripping power of its own. I am biased and perhaps lonely here, but this fussy midget regards it as their peak. HEATHEN EARTH A live-in-the-studio séance recorded in one take in front of a posse of friends and associates, I've always regarded Heathen Earth as the dog in the manger, sounding slightly stiff relative to the unhinged and abrasive live sound captured on the TG24 boxset, which archives their scalding live gigs before frequently hostile crowds with less fidelity but more heart. The opening salvos of this concert draw upon songs and rhythmic tapes already deployed on 20 Jazz Funk Greats, and they sound tentative, fragmentary, slightly inhibited. But things begin to erupt when the whistling-led mirage of ""The World Is a War Film"" dissolves into a ripping version of ""Something Came Over Me"", turning that single into a propulsive, masturbatory launchpad for a swirling noise-dub overload which Carter's remastering has pumped into startling new prominence. Gen holds back from taking much of a vocal frontman position, and the result is a greater awareness of TG's ear for texture. It would take a spicerack of adjectives to do justice to the gnarled, twisted, flanged, and serrated soundworld conjured by the band's unique gear and more-is-more approach to processing. But it's a testimony to their precision that, for all their influence, nobody quite sounds like them when they are truly on blast, as they are here. Things come to a suitably frenzied peak in the stomping, cornet-led ""Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think"", in which Cosey's horn-through delay finally makes good on the clammy flirtations with jazz from 20 Jazz Funk Greats. Having promised a séance on a rainy afternoon, a relaxation technique cassette concludes the jam. GREATEST HITS Though they are taking the piss in passing themselves off as band who had ""hits,"" this compilation from 1980 of 7"" singles and assertive album tracks in fact does the trick nicely: It makes a first-rate introduction to the band and offers a less torturous entryway to their prickly, poisonous oeuvre than any particular album. The swells of ""Hamburger Lady"" start us off feeling nausea, and this bumpy ride builds in force from there. You can sense in this victory lap a kind of précis of their career arc that testifies to the strange tractor-beam effect of pop values on an experimental band. The single element from Second Annual Report is ""Tiab Guls"", a backward version of ""Slug Bait"" that effectively censors the bloody lyrics by upstaging them into a blur. The perkiest and most uptempo high points of D.O.A. and 20 Jazz dominate, and the cover, a pastiche of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny exotica sleeves, tips its hats to the cover of 20 Jazz as well. But the real peaks are the spiky singles ""United"" and ""Adrenalin"", fantastically complete exercises in minimalistic synth-pop songwriting that imply an alternative universe in which Throbbing Gristle were just a fuzzier, more dyspeptic cousin to Depeche Mode and John Foxx. I wish there were a hidden TG album with 20 more songs like these, and it just so happens that the bonus tracks on this CD are the most intriguing and fully formed, including alternative mixes of ""AB/7A"" and ""The Old Man Smiled"". It is this full-speed-ahead electronic pop aspect of TG's lineage that aligns these pioneers of industrial music with the minimal synth, cold wave, and proto-techno revivalists of today. TG were crucial early pioneers of an aesthetic that now cuts a broad swathe across the audio landscape, from Martial Canterel, the Wierd Records posse, and Cold Cave, through to, arguably, lots of recent pop and R&B production, where icy synths and stark drum patterns undergird alienated vocals ad infinitum. It's an unintended irony that a band so hostile to the very idea of ""music"" as such should have created recordings that have become enshrined into canonical constellations, but TG's influence has spiraled outwards as a direct result of their very unreliability and deviance. Thanks to the weird range and high quality of their catalog, separate strands of Throbbing Gristle's DNA are now entwined within the histories of electronic music, techno, dance music, goth aesthetics, occult subcultures, the avant edge of indie rock, and the entirety of the noise underground. It's a capitalist fairtytale born of hipster hindsight: The people who tried as hard as possible to make their audiences uncomfortable turned out to have a little bit of something for everyone. In the wake of Sleazy's startling death in 2010, a kind of melancholic asymmetry has settled into place: the archive as mausoleum. The band can no longer re-unite and tour, though rumors and speculation continue to circulate about the ultimate fate of the extended recording sessions that the band tracked in London at the ICA for an extended deconstructive cover of the entirety of Nico's Desertshore album. In the wake of the decline of the CD and the seemingly inevitable slide downward in fidelity as the new brigade of information hunter-gatherers settle for the lossy, filed-shared free-for-all of torrents over the material culture of collectables, it's a perhaps deliberately out-of-step gesture to decide at precisely this point to remaster, repackage, and represent these Mosaic tablets of noise into upscale commodities memorializing a vanished moment of rebellion. So much for laughing in the face of historians, collectors, and revivalists. Having the last laugh while seemingly anticipating this bittersweet outcome, Throbbing Gristle still don't add up: These albums are perversely inconclusive, by turns drably ugly and beautifully vital. However much Chris Carter has clarified their sound and stabilized their canon, the work itself remains as profoundly self-differential as ever. To cite a phrase the band used for its LP of the cut-ups of their icon and friend William S. Burroughs, there is ""Nothing here now but the recordings."" But those recordings have a funny way of coming to life. In 1981 in the NME, Paul Morley prophesized that ""one day TG's music will sound rich and sweet."" Thanks to Chris Carter's remastering and the necromancy of Industrial Records, that day has arrived.","Five classic Throbbing Gristle albums have been beautifully remastered and lovingly repackaged in gatefolded 2xCD editions.

Drawing of Threes,Desertshore,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b280ea9e61561daa6930/1:1/w_160/514c1ad6.jpeg,2011-12-06 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16095-drawing-of-threes/,Caldo Verde,"San Francisco's Desertshore ostensibly took their name from Nico's 1970 album, the one where she began writing her own songs and exerting more control over her sound and style. A decidedly more personal than commercial album-- with a few songs in German and one sung by her son-- Desertshore was not a hit, at least not on par with her debut or her albums with the Velvet Underground, but it continues to attract as many listeners as it repels. Similarly, Desertshore the band represents guitarist Phil Carney's first step away from sideman status, after a stint in Red House Painters and a few appearances on albums and tours by former Painters frontman Mark Kozelek. Carney favors patient, shimmery repetitions of notes that establish tone instead of melody, and the group, which also includes pianist Chris Connolly and a rotation of percussionists, trades in glacial instrumentals that echo the sepiatone reminiscences of the best Painters tracks. Desertshore, however, do not represent a conscious attempt by Carney to escape that band's orbit; it's less a solo or even a duo project than it is a collaborative entity. Kozelek signed the band to his own Caldo Verde label and contributed to their 2010 debut, Drifting Your Majesty. Now, almost inevitably, Kozelek has more or less joined the group: On their follow-up, Drawing of Threes, he plays barely noticeable basslines and adds lyrics and vocals to six of these 10 songs. It may be as close to a Red House Painters reunion as we will get-- at least until Kozelek reconvenes the original Sun Kil Moon line-up. As a result of Kozelek's participation, Drawing of Threes will sound deeply familiar to anyone who's heard any of the bands mentioned so far. His voice remains distinctively hollow-eyed, his vocal melodies sound as eloquently understated as ever, and the guitars ring in a darkly ruminative mood that sets Desertshore in the same 3 a.m. universe as Old Ramon and Ghosts of Great Highway. In other words, Kozelek dominates this album. Of the four instrumental tracks, only one-- the standout ""Matchlight Arcana""-- exceeds the two-minute mark, while the others sound like soundtrack interstitials consigned to the album's second half. It's an odd dynamic: the guest plays the lead, the name band becomes the support. Whether that speaks to Desertshore's modesty or timidity is never quite clear. Still, it's obvious why the musicians gravitate toward one another, not only here but on previous tours and Kozelek solo records: Their particular instruments suit each other evocatively, each bringing out something intriguing and perhaps unnoticed in the other. In that regard, Drawing is best when it casts the familiar elements in a new light. ""Vernon Forrest"" sets Kozelek's vocals against Connolly's sunlight-on-water piano ripples, like a demo for the vox-and-keys album you know Kozelek has in him. ""Randy Quaid"" is a laundry list of half-remembered summertime totems that includes ""Immigrant Song"" and the troubled Vacation actor and manages to rhyme ""Spalding Gray"" with ""the Brothers Quay."" It's an especially playful song for a notoriously depressive singer-songwriter, and Carney's chiming guitar evokes a specific perspective rather than a general sense of nostalgia. Crucially, it sounds more like the memory of summer than summer itself, which lends the song a bittersweet tone. Because Drawing sustains a similar mood across 10 tracks, the album sounds cohesive, if not exactly revelatory. For Kozelek, this is a not unpleasantly minor effort that allows him to stretch out a bit, but it only hints at what all Carney and Connolly can do together.","On Red House Painters/Mark Kozelek guitarist Phil Carney's sophomore solo album, his boss has more or less joined the group, playing bass and contributing lyrics and vocals to more than half of the tracks.

Part IV,Fred Falke,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b285b1335d7bf169a443/1:1/w_160/09b40823.jpeg,2011-12-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16100-part-iv/,Work It Baby,"Fred Falke is still living in the last century. To my mind, that's no bad thing, but if you're one of those dance fans who thinks the music constantly needs to be mutating into new forms, you may not be quite as excited by this news. Like so many French producers who came up in the wake of Daft Punk's Homework, Falke seems to think house music was perfected around the turn of the millennium, when the twin sounds of Thomas Bangalter's Roulé imprint and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's Crydamoure label-ruled Parisian clubs. There's not a single sound on Part IV, Falke's first solo album, that you also couldn't find on a French dance single from the late 1990s. If you were around at the time, or you've caught up on the pre-millennial Gallic glory days in the wake of DP's pyramid-rocking global success, the sense of déjà vu, of listening to an everything-in-its-right-place collection of familiar and still pungent tricks, will be time-warp disarming. The wildly woozy disco cut-ups of ""Last Wave"" and ""Look Into Your Eyes"", which spend seven or eight minutes chopping and filtering the same bits of insistent boogie bass and mantra-like soul samples, are straight out of Roulé's playbook. The massive synths all over the record, compressed to an overwhelming mid-range buzz, still split the difference between 1980s soft-pop and just-shy-of-dissonant tech-house, just like you'd find on a classic Crydamoure label cut. Even the harsh stuff, say the thuggish electro-goes-metal riff that drags ""Bare Knuckle"" through its paces, which you might think owes something to Justice and the Ed Banger crew's assaults on good taste from a few years back, still has its roots in Daft Punk at their most ear-scouring and inhuman. Of course Falke's not the only current producer to be acting as if everything from minimal to dubstep never happened. The skyscraper-sized riffs, endlessly bumping beats (pitched between deep-house smoothness and stadium-sized techno ruthlessness), and extremist pop gloss of circa 1999 French dance are still everywhere these days, including your local Billboard-friendly pop station. Everything on Part IV is unabashedly huge and peak-time (or drive-time) ready. Slap a pop star on a couple of these tracks, and Falke could be competing with mercenary goons like David Guetta. The difference between Falke and the current crop of club-turned-radio kings, however, is that under the Ibiza-ready wall-of-sound there's an audible love for old-school disco, another thing that marks him out as a French heir to a very French tradition. The fluidity of the basslines all across Part IV nods to both Falke's origins as a bassist and the funkiness of the live band disco days, fluidity and funkiness being two qualities decidedly missing from the robotic ruthlessness of Guetta-style pop-house. The question, of course, is do you need this album if you're already steeped in the classics? It'd be a fib to say that Falke does anything particularly unexpected or inventive with this material. He just knows what he likes, and he's got a very strong, slick grasp on how to assemble the ""perfect"" (if sometimes slightly generic) French house tune, to give you a powerful hit of an old drug. The styles plundered on Part IV comprise a long-proven formula for getting the adrenaline pumping, not something to sneer at when talking dance music. Falke's spent 10 years tweaking these templates until everything is maximally effective, and even if he's no innovator, at least we get to luxuriate in the rush.","There's not a single sound on Fred Falke's first solo album that you also couldn't find on a French dance single from the late 1990s, but he's spent 10 years tweaking these templates until everything is maximally effective.

Tumble Bee,Laura Veirs,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28ab1335d7bf169a451/1:1/w_160/4cfde455.jpeg,2011-12-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16105-tumble-bee/,Raven Marching Band,"Maybe the smartest thing about Laura Veirs' new children's album, Tumble Bee, is that some of its tracks aren't even children's songs. Researching the rich history of American folk music for material she could interpret, Veirs cast a wide net to include not only tunes written expressly for kids, but any other compositions she felt could reasonably slot alongside the likes of ""Little Lap Dog Lullaby"" and ""King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O"". Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the way our 21st-century ears tend to hear anything written 50 or 100 or more years ago as comparatively quaint, songs as thematically disparate as the Civil War-era ""Soldier's Joy"" (here a duet with the Decemberists' Colin Meloy) and a calypso tune popularized by Harry Belafonte, ""Jamaica Farewell"", don't feel so out of place on a record aimed at little ones. Then again, another thing many of these songs have in common is being really strange, and occasionally even quite dark. Listening to some of Veirs' cover choices makes you think of Greil Marcus' famous description of the folk material Bob Dylan and the Band mined in the late 1960s as capturing the ""old, weird America."" There's Woody Guthrie's ""Why Oh Why"", featuring such bizarre existential quandries as ""Why can't a bird eat an elephant?"" and ""Why ain't my grandpa my grandma?"" There's plenty more that's just flat-out macabre, like the title character of ""The Fox"" informing a pen of doomed ducks and geese that ""a couple of you gonna grease my chin."" Sure enough he keeps his promise, his whole family feasts on the fowl, and the song ends by gleefully pointing out that ""the little ones chewed on the bones."" Then there's ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" (also covered in recent years by Calexico and, earlier, Current 93 with Nick Cave), a superficially gentle (hear the percussive elements kindly mimicing jangling spurs) but deeply haunting African-American lullaby dating back to the days of slavery; many versions have neutered the song by altering its most harrowing lines, but Veirs retains them: ""Way down yonder, down in the medder/ There's a poor little lambie/ Bees and the butterflies pecking at its eye/ Poor little thing cried 'Mammy.'"" The title track, a Karl Blau song, is also underlined by a grown-up recognition of disappointment and loss. The music may be jaunty, riding playful trumpets and sparkly keys, but the words and Veirs' fragile voice point to a more sobering reality. ""She'll sting me as she longs to be free,"" Veirs sings of the titular insect. Tumble Bee is a welcome addition to contemporary children's music, not only because it's sufficiently involving to appeal to adults, but also because it further demonstrates that songs for kids don't have to be cloying or sanitized.","Maybe the smartest thing about Laura Veirs' new children's album is that some of its tracks-- including a duet with the Decemberists' Colin Meloy-- aren't children's songs.

Flumina,FenneszSakamoto,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28db1335d7bf169a458/1:1/w_160/282f601c.jpeg,2011-12-06 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16107-flumina/,Touch,"Released in a month which most music nerds spend pouring over year end best of lists and gorging on a buffet of unheard, exotic and often wildly disparate music, Flumina is basically the equivalent of a weeklong juice cleanse. While any collaboration between electronic producer Christian Fennesz and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto has always veered safely into minimal territory, this is easily their most ascetic thing yet; across two discs and two hours, it maintains an almost religious focus on the subtle, slyly shifting interplay between Sakamoto's wandering piano melodies and Fennesz's woolly atmospherics, never peaking or troughing in any dramatic or otherwise notable fashion, and in fact never moving too far from the style and sensibility that it establishes in its very first minutes. Whether you consider this discipline or laziness might depend entirely on how long you listen for, and how. As with all of their collaborations-- as well as a lot of their individual efforts-- the emphasis here is on subtle shifts and interplays, and the rewards therein. Flumina spends the vast majority of its two hours vacillating between holy moments of harmony and others that are subsumed by an undercurrent of atonality and portent. If I were to try to illustrate the pattern by which Sakamoto's cascading piano notes and Fennesz's pulsing and gauzy guitar lines swarmed around each other, I'd guess I'd draw three parts responsiveness for every two parts of randomness. It's a thing that always threatens to unravel but never does. There's a thrill to that, but there's also an inherent formula, and if these tracks feel more like formal exercises than structured compositions, it's because, well, they kind of are. Flumina is actually a concept record that Sakamoto hatched before going on tour earlier this year, and the concept itself is every bit as elegant as you'd expect from someone of his restraint. Beginning in March, he opened each live show by playing a new composition in a different key. By the end of April, he'd accumulated 24 recordings, each in a different key, thereby covering every tonal variant in modern Western music. According to Sakamoto, these tracks were composed from afar with a Fennesz collaboration in mind. That's a lovely thought, and the fact that the record was released so soon after speaks to their mutual admiration. And yet, if one can complain about anything on an album as diffuse as this, it's that Fennesz isn't foregrounded often enough. While something like 2007's Cendre benefited greatly from an occasional splash of his cotton-wool electronics, there are very few moments like that here, and frankly, it needs more. Those who listen to Flumina actively for its full two hours might also miss that extra element. If you listen to Flumina like I do, though, passively or in short bursts, you're ultimately left with variations on the same thought: This is still an inspired combination.","Though they composed pieces in every key and their work stretches to fill two hours on this 2xCD set, electronic producer Christian Fennesz and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto have created their most ascetic offering to date.

Undun,The Roots,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2895e6ef959693222f7/1:1/w_160/d3a054b8.jpeg,2011-12-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/,Def Jam,"Undun is the story of a man, Redford Stevens, dying in reverse, rewinding from the moment he became a statistic and hitting the points in his life where he's at his most self-aware. That he's a criminal who got caught up in the familiar street-hustle trappings that the modern media's documented countless times is a pivotal detail-- it's hit at an angle that seems to emphasize the futile inevitability of it all. His life could be any number of misdirected narratives that ends with a toe tag, and what details listeners learn about him are hazy, buried under archetypal turns of fate and decisive struggles. That this protagonist is a fictionalized composite of a handful of real people, filtered through a matter-of-fact narrative that splits character ambivalence with journalistic impartiality, only makes his lack of direction and the failure of any real closure stand out even more. ""Lotta niggas go to prison,"" Dice Raw states on ""Tip the Scale"", ""how many come out Malcolm X?"" So the Roots' latest album isn't a sprawling, rise-and-fall crime story, not a condemnation or a veneration of a man living outside the law, not a bullet-riddled grand guignol heavy on explicit details of soldiers getting cut down. It's a character study of a man whose existential crisis ends only with his death-- a death gone largely unspecified, the glamor and tragedy washed over with a doomed resignation. That's a hard thing to pull off, even for a band as given to deep-thinking concepts as the Roots are. And when your main lyrical catalyst is Black Thought-- a man more given to allusions than direct statements-- it's likely that it'll take a while for the full scope of Undun to really sink in. If and when it does, it might strike listeners as a bit skeletal: omit the mood-setting instrumental bookends, including a brief, four-part orchestral suite that builds off Sufjan Stevens' ""Redford (For Yia-Yia and Pappou)"", and you've got maybe a half hour's worth of material. By ?uestlove's accounts, writing Redford's story introduced the headaches and challenges that come with scriptwriting into their songwriting, and what's left on Undun is the end result of frequent revisions and rewrites that attempt to reconcile character, theme, and continuity. If it comes at the expense of nuance, it's not always obvious: There's an easy-to-trace narrative line from Redford's acceptance of his fate (""Sleep"") to his acknowledgement of how close it's approaching (""Make My""), back through declarations of aggravated toughness (""One Time""), and celebratory fatalism (""Kool On""), along ups and downs that juxtapose motivation (""Stomp"") and helplessness (""Lighthouse""). When the vocal portion of the album ends with two of the bleakest sets of verses in the Roots discography, peaking with the estrangement of ""I Remember"" and the desperation of ""Tip the Scale"", Undun reveals itself as a story where a man's actual death isn't quite as tragic as the circumstances that pushed him to it. The catch is that the inevitable familiarity of this storyline, even in the service of a deep emotional study, is almost an end in itself-- a cycle seen far too often, played out in terms anyone who's ever been or known someone with their back against the wall can understand. And if Undun succeeds at putting one man's criminal-world struggle with free will and fate in empathetic terms, it does so at the expense of any unique details or unusual traits that would set him apart-- Redford is humanized, but he's not entirely individualized. If you've bought an Apple device in the last couple of years, you can download a free app that includes some world-building video clips and photos that give him more of a full-life context. If you're still relying on a Blackberry and a clickwheel iPod, you're left with the voices of Black Thought, Dice Raw, and the now-more-googleable Greg Porn to fill in most of the blanks. They're admirable technicians and can be charismatic on their own terms, but voicing raw emotion isn't a major strength for any of them. What you do get is a heightened sense of perplexed frustration, and there are times when Black Thought actually hits another level in his lyrics to meet it. A resilient, on-the-grind turn of phrase like ""I'm never sleeping like I'm on methamphtamines/ Move like my enemy 10 steps ahead of me"" (""Kool On"") is delivered with the same emphasis as a bitter, regretful line like ""I'll leave the memories here, I won't need them/ If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom"" (""Lighthouse""). But if that's one of the reasons Undun feels almost relentless in its singleminded dejection, it's also proof that, if Black Thought can't always push through a sentiment with his voice, he can at least deliver the fuck out of an idea. The other MCs in the Roots' core provide some welcome shifts in tone: Greg Porn's nasal drone often slips into bluntly nihilistic imagery (""Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat/ Daddy should've let me be a stain on the bed sheets""), and Dice Raw's rapper/singer double-threat role continues to provide a heart of much-needed pathos. His closing line on ""One Time"" might be the most pitch-perfect moment of film noir cynicism on the album: ""To make it to the bottom, such a high climb."" When Phonte and Big K.R.I.T. deliver guest verses that still feel like relative afterthoughts, it's a bit disappointing, but they come strong enough to keep the album's fated, introspective mood consistent. There's one other aspect to Undun that gives it a sense of ambivalence, even if it's a minor and comparative one: The music itself feels less immediate. After How I Got Over channeled frustrated, brooding soul toward a gradual expansion into triumphant liveliness, the limited palette of down-to-mid-tempo dirges here feels almost stiflingly gloomy. Which means it works-- if this album is a cinematic experience, the score here fills in the cues for moods that the MCs mostly just suggest. The drums-and-keys structure feels more delicate and less urgent than the Roots' best meditative moments, and what few tracks there are with some kick to them-- the burbly guitar-driven ""Kool On"", the worried funk of ""Lighthouse""-- have more of a pull in their chorus than anything in the instrumentation does. Yet the cumulative effect of all that mournful weight is effective enough in the story's service. And in the run-up to ""Tip the Scale"", a string-accented elegy loosely reminiscent of ""You Got Me"", the idea comes across that any glimmer of optimism in this album would be beside the point. This isn't the Roots' most accessible album, and it's definitely their most downbeat, but it comes from a place that isn't always easy to dwell.","The Roots' 13th album, which includes a brief, four-part orchestral suite that builds off a Sufjan Stevens piece, is definitely their most downbeat. It's a concept record that tells the story of a man dying, in reverse.

Quilt,Quilt,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2789d034d5c69bf4b92/1:1/w_160/4efbefc9.jpeg,2011-12-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16089-quilt/,Mexican Summer,"Quilt is an East Coast group of Anna Fox Rochinsk, Shane Butler, and John Andrews. They've been touring the basement show circuit and putting out occasional, limited-run releases since 2009, although I hadn't heard of them until this year's SXSW festival, when my band shared a makeshift wooden stage with them, at an unofficial backyard showcase in South Austin, hosted by WNYU. The odor of smoke, brisket, and crawfish stew seemed the perfect accompaniment to their twangy, somewhat ramshackle blend of 1960s psychedelia, mantric blues, and folk, and I remember realizing that they were the first band I had heard all week whose vocal parts included classic, three-part harmonies-- and whose use of a Farfisa was less retro-futuristic than straight-up retro. Quilt sounded kind of like a flashback to a time, not so long ago, when Sunburned Hand of the Man made the cover of The Wire under the banner of ""New Weird America,"" and artists like Devendra Banhart and Six Organs of Admittance prompted indie music fans to snap up reissues of outsider folk records by Vashti Bunyan, Jandek, and Alexander ""Skip"" Spence. The members of Quilt are probably old enough to remember and have been impacted by a time-- roughly around the mid-aughts-- when the global economy was still in a boom phase rather than a bust, and much of the independent music community seemed bent on expressing its independent-mindedness through an ethos of retreat: out of the city and into the woods, back through the years to the screaming guitar solos and of the hippy generation and the vulnerable rawness of Anglo-American folk singing, inward to the depths of the psyche and the eccentricites of character. The thing that struck me most about Quilt, at the time, was not that they seemed to be backtracking to a revivalist movement in recent memory that was not exactly their generation's own; it was that the particular reference points they were drawing on simply weren't ones I had heard in a while. Like their namesake, Quilt's music feels handmade and stitched-together, as though its creators were sifting through a collection of musical hand-me-downs and collating the bits that spoke to them into something new. This patchwork quality extends not only to their juxtaposition, say, of Neil Young bass-bounce and the kind of half-spoken poetic narration you might hear on one of the Incredible String Band's early records, but to their melodic sensibility at large, which favors tightly interlocking arrangements of simple motifs. The band's writing process, so they say, consists in endlessly improvising on a collection of predetermined chord progressions, and the resulting intricacy comes particularly to the fore on their self-titled debut for Mexican Summer, which they recorded with the help of Apollo Sunshine's Jesse Gallagher in the summers of 2010 and 2011. Percussion work was split between founding drummer Taylor Mcvay and John Andrews, who has since replaced her. Quilt unfolds in a series of vividly colored scenes, ranging from the hushed suspense of opener ""Young Gold"" to bouncy, open road cruisers like ""Cowboys in the Void"" and ""Penobska Oakwalk"", and the lovesick sweetness of ""Utopian Canyon"", which casts Fox Rochinski's crystalline soprano front and center. Shifts in tempo and key occur frequently within a single song, with Butler and Fox Rochinski trading off the narration as vocal harmonies move like tectonic plates around the central melodic line. On standout ""Cowboys in the Void"", a snaky guitar duel enhances our impression of theatrical tension until an unexpected vocal yelp comes along and dispels it, capturing all the terror and exhilaration of jumping into the titular unknown. Again, there's the creeping sensation that we have heard a lot these melodies and transitions and echoing guitar notes before. Either they replicate specific moments in the history of 20th-century American music that we cannot concretely pin down, or they are designed to reflect a set of unwritten expectations and parameters-- the kind of collective sensibility that allows us to predict how the slightly detuned, chromatic banjo pattern on closer ""Gome Home"" might resolve itself at the end of the phrase, for example, or identify this music as ""Americana,"" or distinctly ""American,"" even if we are unable to say what those words really mean. In its less captivating passages, which are few, Quilt will sound like a pitch-perfect rendition of some 1969 acid-folk reissue that was never quite as memorable as you hoped. At its most exhilarating, the record may recall a time when you blasted a song like ""California Dreamin'"", and thought about how doubly thrilling it must have been when your parents first experienced it, and it actually sounded unlike anything they had ever heard. The members of Quilt couldn't possibly have predicted the impact of the call for change that would originate from their own generation just a few months after they completed the record, but they do seem strangely prescient on ""Children of Light"", when they sing, ""We're going off to war/ Not like the one before."" As for imagining what a politically engaged music of the y-generation might sound like, and how it might differ from that of the baby boomers, Butler offers up some curious food for thought on ""Penobska Oakwalk"": ""Why would we try, why should we try to make anew/ When we could be intoxicated by this ordinary turn again?""","The East Coast group Quilt's self-titled debut offers a twangy, somewhat ramshackle blend of 1960s psychedelia, mantric blues, and folk.

Daydream Repeater,Co La,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b268c0084474cd0c1f7e/1:1/w_160/5b335c23.jpeg,2011-12-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16080-co-la-weekend-repeater/,NNA Tapes,"A couple of weeks ago, Pitchfork Editor-in-Chief Mark Richardson wrote a column on what he called ""the Tumblr-ization of indie."" One of his ideas was that an artist like Lana Del Rey is basically a collage-- or in his metaphor, a Tumblr-- of images and sounds she thinks are cool. In a cultural moment when the past is instantly accessible-- not to mention one in which we're used to constant reference and appropriation-- it makes sense that we start conflating ""who we are"" with ""what we're into."" Instead of creating, the artist collects. As viewers-- or listeners, or whatever-- we learn to read between the lines and explore juxtapositions. Is it possible, for example, for me to express something about myself that can't be best expressed by saying, ""I'm pretty into Hawaiian slack-key guitar music and body horror movies?"" Liking things-- something we all do by reflex-- becomes a creative gesture if you do it thoughtfully. Listening to Daydream Repeater, Ecstatic Sunshine member Matthew Papich's first full-length album as Co La, I revisited an experience I haven't had since college: Walking down the street, seeing someone wearing the t-shirt of a band I like, and thinking, cool. It's comforting to know other people like the same things we do-- in this case, skinhead reggae from the mid-1960s, field recordings from the Cameroonian rainforest, cricket noises, music in major keys. It's an incredibly lightweight album-- thin-sounding, super-repetitive, bright to the point of translucence. (Though Daydream Repeater doesn't sound stylistically like Ecstatic Sunshine, people familiar with them might recognize the directive: feel good all the time, over and over again). Papich is no archeologist, nor do I think he's trying to show off his knowledge of obscure sounds-- most of the time, he doesn't even bother disguising his samples. Whether you attribute this to laziness or naive grace probably depends on frame of mind. By techno or hip-hop standards, Daydream Repeater would be artless, but my sense is that the music on it is closer to something like Girl Talk for audiences who don't like getting the shit beaten out of them-- music that wants you to say, ""Hey, I recognize that,"" music that makes you feel included rather than excluded. When interviewed for a ""Rising"" column a few weeks ago, Papich namechecked Erik Satie, a turn-of-the-century French composer who coined the term musique d'ameublement, or ""furniture music""-- basically, the foundation for what we now call ""ambient."" Clearly Papich wants to be part of that conversation, or he wouldn't have made the reference. Whether he adds much to it or not, I don't know. The irony of Satie's music is that, at the time, it was considered radical and antagonistic. Papich has 100 years of art to validate music as brainless and determinedly relaxing as his own. I've listened to Daydream Repeater a lot lately, but at moments when I otherwise don't want to be listening to music. To my mind, it sounds less like ambience and more like exotica. Its imaginary world is the yacht deck without seasickness or boredom, jungles without the fist-sized bugs. It's music for imagining you're in a perfect somewhere else. Five songs are named after places: ""Egyptian Peaches"", ""Belgian Pillow"", ""My Jamaican"", ""Siamese in Greece"", ""Burning One in Stockholm."" That's where the Tumblr thing comes in. Daydream Repeater plays more like a mixtape than an album-- a document of where someone's been and what they've liked. Aside from one surprising flip of ""Be My Baby"", Papich doesn't seem as interested in transforming his source material as much as just presenting it. Here's a reggae song I like, he says, and then plays it with some echo. A couple of minutes later, something else. In the cracks between, some aesthetic takes shape.  Some of my colleagues here seem outright frustrated by how little Papich seems to interact with his material. For a record so airy and noncommittal, I feel semi-conflicted about it. He doesn't really seem bent on invention. But I like listening to Daydream Repeater. I'd repost it.","On his first Co La full-length, Ecstatic Sunshine member Matthew Papich makes bright, lightweight loop-based music for imagining you're in a perfect somewhere else.

Kiss & Tell EP,Kid Sister,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2849d034d5c69bf4ba7/1:1/w_160/02bca096.jpeg,2011-12-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16096-kid-sister-kiss-tell-ep/,Fool’s Gold,"Stop me if you think you've heard this one before: up-and-coming rapper teams with up-and-coming label, releases shit-hot single with big co-signer, fumbles around for two hype-stifling years on clunker of a debut, is now seemingly poised to repeat the cycle all over again. So has been the short, frustrating story of Chicago MC Kid Sister, whose potential as a bona fide party-rocker on ""Pro Nails"" gave way to 2009's oft-delayed Ultraviolet, a record of party-pop pablum crammed into a thin, day-glo colored shell. Ultraviolet clearly encouraged Kid Sister to reevaluate her career, as she remained somewhat quiet until last January, when she offered up the vaguely Diplo-vian, world-party vibing Kiss Kiss Kiss freebie mixtape. Now there's Kiss & Tell, a four-track EP that aims to reestablish Kid Sister as the brash, brazen rap star she hinted at becoming out of the gate. So it's kind of a shame that, at a time when the demand for brash, brazen female voices in hip-hop seems to be at an encouraging high, Kid Sister has delivered another stop-gap that highlights her inability recapture or recontextualize her style or persona as a mic-rocking diva worthy of your undivided attention. Instead, Kiss & Tell is yet another entry in a long line of teases that seems to be an exercise in obligation rather than anticipation, with generic rhymes, little hook appeal and only four new verses to its credit. Most of it fails to really offer fans anything new-- actually, if it weren't for the fact that you could stream the entire thing for free, it's unclear as to why anyone would bother giving it a go. Clocking in at just under 11 minutes, Kiss & Tell features two new tracks, a polished version of ""Click Clack (Show It Off)"" from Kiss Kiss Kiss (simplified here as ""Cliq Claq""), plus a remix of ""Gucci Rag Top"" from the same tape. The good news here is that, in an attempt to supplement her personality and remain current, she locks down two fun features, with Fool's Gold labelmate Danny Brown and lobotomized pop-rap experiment MTV Riff Raff, respectively. ""Gucci Rag Top"" already had a kind of trap-approved Salt-N-Pepa playfulness to it when Gucci Mane was on it, but he's easily bested here, with Brown wedging in yet another great verse in a year he's already packed with gems (not to mention, the video has now blessed us with this). And on ""Hide & Seek"" (which features some clean production from Sinden), everyone's favorite former ""From G's to Gents"" contestant gets to threaten to ""pull up on you jokes in my yacht-style boat."" Still, Kid Sister never seems to get with the program. The cartoonish fun of ""Hide & Seek"" seems lost on her, and new track ""Mickey"" irritates without the benefit of offering an accompanying YouTube dance craze. But this is all coming from an EP that has done the absolute minimum to keep its name in what I expect to be tightening, specific circles. Obviously Kiss & Tell is priming us for a sophomore full-length (the Neptunes are rumored to be in the fold), but it's hard to tell what it says about the direction she's headed in. Judging from the amount of effort that went into this, we may never get the chance to find out.","After Kid Sister's long-delayed clunker of a debut, this four-song EP finds the Chicago MC aiming to reestablish herself as the brash, brazen rap star she hinted at becoming out of the gate.

Yamantaka // Sonic Titan,Yamantaka // Sonic Titan,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2839d034d5c69bf4ba4/1:1/w_160/b4ac7700.jpeg,2011-12-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16097-yamantakasonic-titan/,Psychic Handshake,"It's no coincidence that Emerson, Lake & Palmer once recorded a live album at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, that Roger Waters was inspired to write The Wall after a spit-soaked altercation with an overzealous fan at the same venue, and that the city is home to the world's most popular Genesis tribute band-- this town loves it some prog-rock. Perhaps it's because Montreal is the North American metropolis with the most pronounced European influence, but even local bands of metal (Voivod), Britpop (the Dears), electro-punk (Les Georges Leningrad), and populist-indie (Arcade Fire) origin have embraced the genre's narrative qualities, intricate musicality, and theatricality. Montreal's Yamantaka//Sonic Titan are the latest torch-bearers for the city's prog-and-proud tradition. But where the most renowned prog-rock bands have introduced thematic frameworks into their music very gradually over the course several years-- remember, even Rush started out writing three-minute pop crotch-rockers about wanting to get laid-- the conceptual scope and song-cycle composition heard on YT//ST is the result of refinement and focus. To say the duo of Ruby Kato Attwood and Alaska B have lofty ambitions would be an understatement. Being of Anglo-Asian descent-- the former is Japanese-Scottish, the latter Chinese-Irish-- the two formed Yamantaka//Sonic Titan to address the duality of their cultural identities, as reflected in their band's double name, not to mention the tendency to appear in public sporting kabuki face paint and bikinis. Early shows were reportedly defined by decorative stage sets, performance art, homemade instruments made of trash and noisy experimentation, as the duo worked toward the goal of making its debut album a full-blown ""noh-wave"" rock opera, titled Star. Now that YT//ST have solidified into an eight-piece rock-band formation, they've issued this album as a 30-minute preview of that larger, still-in-progress work. But the record feels wholly substantial and satisfying in its own right, and even those with no prior knowledge of YT//ST's history and elaborate intentions can just enjoy it for what it is: volcanic prog-rock colored with equal parts post-punk urgency, stoner-metal heft, and psychedelic pop whimsy. Thanks to smart, brisk sequencing, the seven disparate songs presented here hang together as a seamless piece, even if the thematic devices linking them aren't so easy to discern: The tribal-ceremonial scene setter ""Queens"" offers references to ravens, snakes, hounds, and Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist-horror classic The Holy Mountain, but it proves to be the only lyrically legible song on the album, as Ruby and Alaska become increasingly reliant on words of indeterminate language and ghostly harmonies. However, inscrutably titled songs like the funhouse-mirrored acid-pop of ""Reverse Crystal//Murder of a Spider"" and the space-age stomper ""Hoshi Neko"" nonetheless display an insidiously melodic quality that suggests Stereolab on steroids. And where these songs foreground YT//ST's eccentric side, the nightmarish, seven-minute colossus ""A Star Over Pureland"" showcases their command of brute physicality, pitting the ladies' echo-drenched shrieks against a relentless, jackhammered fuzz-metal assault, like Fly-era Yoko Ono waging war with Lightning Bolt. Yamantaka//Sonic Titan may still aspire to the sort of conceptual grandeur that requires an Olympic Stadium to contain it, but right now, what they're really good at is putting the ""raw"" in prog.","Montreal octet Yamantaka//Sonic Titan's debut-- a 30-minute preview of a larger ""noh-wave"" opera-- is a collection of volcanic prog-rock colored with post-punk urgency, stoner-metal heft, and psychedelic pop whimsy.

We Bought a Zoo OST,Jónsi,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28613d197565213a7b3/1:1/w_160/cfa1bf9e.jpg,2011-12-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16104-we-bought-a-zoo/,Columbia,"You've got very few choices if you're looking for someone with name recognition and vestigial indie cred to score a big-budget holiday movie called We Bought a Zoo. The Flaming Lips have already done their Christmas movie soundtrack (and, yes, even have a song about Christmas at the zoo), and this is a Cameron Crowe film we're talking about, one that's being touted as ""from the director of Jerry Maguire,"" as opposed to, say, ""from the director of Almost Famous."" So Jónsi it is, and you can't argue with the decision. As frontman of Sigur Rós, his vocals embody wide-eyed wonder without devolving into unbearable twee overload. So We Bought a Zoo naturally manifests as a work of mutual admiration and mutual benefit and everyone comes out of it feeling better about themselves. Which is to say that above all else, the level of risk and likelihood to satisfy is on par with that of, say, a Cameron Crowe movie being released for the holidays. What Crowe gets out of this relationship is obvious. But if Jónsi actually ever needed an audio résumé to snag more jobs like this one, he could just slap down a USB of We Bought a Zoo and have it speak for his emergence as a unique, bankable commodity post-Ágætis Byrjun. This is partially by design: one Sigur Rós song is included, but it's an epochal one. Much like ""Svefn-g-englar"" (a major player on the soundtrack to Crowe's Vanilla Sky), ""Hoppípolla"" has become shorthand for a specific era of Sigur Rós, indicative of their brassier, bolder, and more concise songwriting that came after ( ) stretched their most inscrutable tendencies to infinity. We Bought a Zoo gets its spark from key tracks off Jónsi's 2010 solo album, Go. Yes, it's hard to separate Jónsi from his day gig, but if We Bought a Zoo gets people to think of Go as far more than something other than a Sigur Rós spinoff, well, hopefully it'll inspire Jónsi to give us more of the same. Despite the greater prevalence of synthetic strings and dance beats, there's something more primal about these songs than those of latter day Sigur Rós. ""Go Do"" speaks to a universal ideal of action and while time will reveal how ""Boy Lilikoi"" fits into this particular movie, the childish primitivism would've worked just fine within Where the Wild Things Are (though perhaps with Disney animation rather than brooding browns and grays). So what's the draw for those of us who already share Crowe's ardent Jónsi fanhood? That's where a shade over a half hour of new music he composed for the film comes in, with tasteful brass and string arrangements courtesy of Nico Muhly. It's heartening to hear about the film's working title and climactic scene being inspired by 2007 live documentary Heima and the director encouraging Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson to listen to certain Sigur Rós songs to get their energy correct for certain scenes (I expect plenty of beatific, skyward gazing). And certainly, it's exciting to imagine Jónsi coming from Iceland to hunker down with what Crowe calls a ""a toy sample keyboard and a head full of ideas."" But let's not forget that while Crowe brought Jónsi in for his uniquely whimsical and weighty approach, it's still whimsy-for-hire.  So those trebly piano twinkles, elegiac tempos, octave-shifted vocals that hover and haunt like friendly ghosts? They're all here, treated with a bit of textural abrasion and arranged into small, three-minute packages with utilitarian titles like ""Sun"", ""Brambles"", and ""Humming"". Even one of two vocal tracks Jónsi composed specifically for the film hints a little to the melody from ""White Christmas"". Dude's a good company man. Of course, it's all lovely and certainly more immediately engaging and compact than Jónsi's mostly-instrumental Riceboy Sleeps multimedia project from 2009. But it also has something going for it more important than gorgeous ambience: the Jónsi seal of quality. Does his work as an arranger and curator rank in the same percentile as his work as a vocalist? Not really, and even if starlit passages like ""Sinking Friendships"" or the luxuriant title track put in fine work with moving images, they aren't likely to dislodge anything from the upper echelon of his past work. But hopefully, offering the bold and evolving gestures of Jónsi's past decade in a relatively safe and compact design allows the possibility that a moviegoer might come out of the theater curious enough to parlay $10 into a meaningful relationship with Jónsi's music. And if that's the case, I think a lot of us are jealous of those who get to experience Sigur Rós for the first time in 2011.","The soundtrack to the new Cameron Crowe film consists of a song by Sigur Rós, music from Jónsi's solo album Go, and 30 minutes of new material with arrangements by Nico Muhly.

"yMusic, Beautiful Mechanical",yMusic,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25d13d197565213a76a/1:1/w_160/cbf92e9b.jpeg,2011-12-02 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16066-ymusic-beautiful-mechanical/,New Amsterdam,"If you're an indie rocker in need of chamber instruments, odds are you'll end up hiring a member of yMusic. The quietly ubiquitous sextet has spent its three-year existence amassing cross-genre collaborations like so many passport stamps: you've heard them, wittingly or not, playing with Bon Iver, Björk, Grizzly Bear, Sufjan Stevens, Arcade Fire, the National, Vampire Weekend-- you get the idea. But they also perform as a more traditional contemporary-classical ensemble, and on Beautiful Mechanical, their first proper full-length, they mix up the two worlds, slotting compositions from St. Vincent's Annie Clark and Son Lux alongside new works from young composer colleagues. The album's existence is a feat of networking savvy and determination-- it was funded via Kickstarter page-- but the music itself is sadly hit-or-miss, underlining a melancholy truth about bridging genre divides: It results in empty press-release fodder as often as it produces luminous, surprising new music. Son Lux's titular work, ""Beautiful Mechanical"", lands somewhere blankly in the middle. Son Lux is no dabbler: He studied composition at Indiana University. But his work is somehow both antic and utterly frozen-- its gestures twitter away in different corners of the compositional space without engaging thematically. The work, which does some sly things with missing beats and rhythmic emphases, is technically assured, but it feels like the sort of forgettable, frictionless, minimalist sketch you can currently hear too many of at downtown-NYC new-music concerts. Annie Clark fares significantly better. In fact, her piece, ""Proven Badlands"", might be the most beguiling and multi-layered composition on the album. On the basis of it alone, Clark could easily slip outside of her indie rock clubhouse entirely for an album's worth of chamber-music miniatures. ""Badlands"" begins with a swan-necked glide of a bassoon line, a thrice-digested memory of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". Cello and flute hop lightly into the frame. Then, the instruments clear out a space for an unexpected finger-picked acoustic guitar. Interesting things keep happening: A muted trumpet calls out a yearning tritone, the sharp, ear-troubling interval found at the heart of West Side Story. Bugling horns erupt into a locked-in pattern, an arch almost-quote from some lost big-band record. The work is a lively jumble of jazzy-French flavors, strongly suggesting that Clark's education in the classical canon made a little extra time for Debussy, Milhaud, and other jazz-age cosmopolitans. Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond also shows up to hand yMusic two sketches-- one vaguely Eastern, one vaguely African. Both are spry bundles of tiny noises. Worden's rich singing voice, which lit last year's Penelope, isn't here, but her pieces are imbued with the same lamplight glow. They are minor, but lively. Sarah Kirkland Snider, the composer of Penelope, revisits its agitated sound world with ""Daughter of the Waves"", a nine-minute swirl of muted anxiety. Judd Greenstein's ""Clearing, Dawn, Dance"" starts with a loping figure in the woodwinds and sends it rippling expertly outward through the ensemble, like small bobbing boats in a wake-- tracking its movement and hearing how Greenstein obscures it proves absorbing listening all on its own. yMusic are part of a resourceful, engaged cluster of young classical musicians who are furiously networking a full-blown scene into existence. Collectively, they represent the movement's best qualities: broad-minded, ambitious, eagerly collaborative. However, Beautiful Mechanical also hints at some of the still-growing scene's nagging limitations: As exciting as all this activity is to behold, the marketing heat it generates carries over into its music only about half of the time. There are delightful moments scattered throughout, but the overall impression is of a small box of baubles, modest and lovely but inessential.","The contemporary-classical sextet have played with Bon Iver, Björk, Grizzly Bear, Sufjan Stevens, and Arcade Fire. Their first LP slots compositions from Annie Clark, Shara Worden, and Son Lux alongside young-composer colleagues.

Radiant Door EP,Crystal Stilts,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27313d197565213a78d/1:1/w_160/b8cc1c60.jpeg,2011-12-02 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16078-radiant-door-ep/,Sacred Bones,"Crystal Stilts have always been ahead of the contemporary indie pop learning curve. When most of their peers were products of the widely beloved C86 tape in 2008, the Brooklyn quintet was namedropping the Clean cofounder David Kilgour's the Great Unwashed. The components that make their sound are fastidiously plucked from early-1980s Manchester (Joy Divison) and New Zealand (the Clean, the Chills), late-1960s New York (the Velvet Underground), and-- in cases including but not limited to singer Brad Hargett's hair-- early Bob Dylan. But influence doesn't mean anything if it's not siphoned into something worthwhile, and Crystal Stilts do much more than sit on their first-edition copies of Flying Nun vinyl and collect cool points. Their debut album Alight of Night found them firing off shimmering guitar lines and then simmering into a thick haze, alternating between sunny afternoon clang and after-hours sulk. Using his voice as another instrument instead of a vehicle for dynamic singing or pseudo-profound lyrical messages, Hargett's deep baritone blends low into the mix, the use of reverb rivaling that of an epic fantasy movie narrator. The album was used as the foundation for this year's In Love With Oblivion, though that newer collection was a fuller-sounding affair, more urgent in places (""Shake the Shackles""), more daring in others (""Alien Rivers""), and filled with pop tunes brimming with life from corner to corner. Crystal Stilts are a band that doesn't have much use for empty space-- most of the silence gets chased away by the blasts of trebly volume. Radiant Door is not a radical departure from that default sound; its Kilgour Brothers-indebted style makes it safe to assume kiwi is still the most important item on their tour rider. But not all groups have to rely on the benefit of reinvention. The non-vocalists of Crystal Stilts are incredibly good at adding a Technicolor flair, crafting arrangements so colorful that they often veer into kaleidoscopic territory. Two of the five songs on the EP feature the quintet nakedly putting its record collection at the forefront of its consciousness, this time in the form of recorded covers. The band's take on Blue Orchids' ""Low Profile"" is a key example of this; it's faithful enough to the original to be recognizable, but the Stilts' heavy lifting-- as it mostly always does-- comes from keyboardist Kyle Forester and guitarist/co-songwriter JB Townsend, the former turning in a simple-but-catchy three-note riff, the latter sounding like he's been planting Joshua Trees around Brooklyn. The EP's other cover, Lee Hazlewood's ""Still as the Night"", finds the band in spaghetti-western outlaw mode, exploring a style they've heretofore never tried. The song is spare in a way that's uncommon to the band. It doesn't quite work with a singer like Hargett, whose booming voice (that sometimes wavers in and out of key) is far more suited to weathering the band's stormier moments than trying to fill in gaps. Though ""Still as the Night"" is a good song that falls just short of being great, it doesn't stall the band-- they've always been adept at playing to their strengths, and the rest of the EP's 21 minutes are full of gleaming keyboard lines and jangly guitars casting sun on everything in sight. For a band that has proven it can do darkness just as well, Radiant Door is exactly as its title suggests-- the brighter side of one of America's best psych-pop bands.","As the title of this 21-minute EP suggests, Radiant Door offers a look at the brighter side of the Brooklyn psych-pop quintet.

Well-Done,Statik SelektahAction Bronson,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26b13d197565213a77d/1:1/w_160/e1fca993.jpeg,2011-12-02 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16084-action-bronsonstatik-selektah-well-done/,DCide,"Some small, reflexive impatience in me longed to dismiss Action Bronson's existence the second I heard his sales pitch: white guy from Queens, sounds exactly like Ghostface Killah, raps over soul loops and has a thing for extravagant food metaphors because he's also a chef. I mean, come on. It felt so on-the-nose it hardly needed to exist, like an abandoned Adult Swim pilot in rapper form. Hadn't we all proved to each other that we loved Ghostface enough already? Did we all need to come in for that group hug again? There's a lot of love in that corner, but hoo boy, was it ever growing musty. But Bronson, as he tends to do, dismantled my defenses. He's that kind of guy; watching YouTube clips of him, say, searing a slab of ahi tuna in an oversized orange Polo shirt is to be mowed over by an irresistible charm offensive. It helps that he's an undeniably talented rapper. He might be sampling Ghostface's voice, but lately Ghostface has been using it wrong, and to hear someone pick up Ghost's manic energy where he left it (arguably, somewhere around Fishscale) is like watching an eager creative team breathe new life into a beloved but weary old franchise. Well-Done, Bronson's followup to his breakthrough, Dr. Lecter, pairs him with producer Statik Selektah, who is something of a spiritual brother-in-arms: Together, they could probably stage a Civil-War-style reenactment of the ""Ice Cream"" video. Selektah gives Bronson 15 functionally bumping, minimally tweaked DJ Premier/Pete Rock updates: horn stabs, clipped drums, scratched vocal samples, lots of empty space to fill. Bronson barrels his big-shouldered way through it all, and, like Dr. Lecter, the end result is about as reliably pleasurable as a good slice. Bronson's biggest strengths are a goofy sense of humor and a refreshing lack of self-regard: At its best, Well-Done is like spending 45 minutes with the affable, roly-poly guy who cracked you up at your high school lunch table. ""See my silhouette, right behind me bitches pirouette/ That's a dance move, it's origin is French,"" he informs us on ""White Silk"". He cracks winningly on his weight: ""Underneath a lot of blubber, lot of six pack."" (""Cocoa Butter""). Say what you will about his originality, but he's unquestionably an innovator in the field of nonsensical Obama namedrops: ""Obama copped me the sandwich!"" he bellows at one point, ""Obama EBT, I'm a G"" at another. And his gusto with food metaphors rivals Ghost at his ""my stomach growlin!"" best: his lungs, when he smokes weed, are ""smoky like the pork shoulder."" Instead of crushing up flakes of blow, he raps about ""crushing fennel pollen,"" and his blunt-force conviction renders it as magnetically cool-sounding an activity as coke-kingpin razor-shaving for precisely that millisecond. None of this enacts some magical crowbar separation between him and Ghostface, of course, a separation he's starting to show signs of desiring: He has protested weakly in interviews that his style is actually a cross between Cam'ron and Kool G Rap, which is kind of like Shyne insisting he never really listened to Biggie. But Bronson shouldn't sweat the comparisons, or worse, try to fend them off: Fondly reminding people of one of the greatest rappers ever is hardly a curse.","The undeniably talented Queens rapper follows his breakthrough Dr. Lecter with this collaboration with producer Statik Selektah.

Camp,Childish Gambino,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2635e6ef959693222af/1:1/w_160/64dfe0a1.jpg,2011-12-02 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/,Glassnote,"If you buy only one hip-hop album this year, I'm guessing it'll be Camp. The album maintains some of the overweening humor of Donald Glover's sitcom ""Community"", but Glover's exaggerated, cartoonish flow and overblown pop-rap production are enough to make Camp one of the most uniquely unlikable rap records of this year (and most others). What's worse is how he uses heavy topics like race, masculinity, relationships, street cred, and ""real hip-hop"" as props to construct a false outsider persona. On record, he paints himself as a misunderstood victim of cultural preconceptions who is obviously smarter and funnier than his primetime material suggests. Unfortunately, it's a position that holds up to absolutely no scrutiny whatsoever. Glover's not doing himself any favors with a rap handle taken from the Wu-Tang Name Generator, but that'd be easy to overlook if Camp functioned as anything more than a series of similar one-note gags. On a song-by-song basis, he scripts a slightly off-brand, fictional version of Kanye West being played for laughs. We could talk about Glover's bloodlines all day, but Childish Gambino's paternity test traces straight back to ""All Falls Down"". ""You See Me"" reimagines ""Niggas in Paris"" as a meme cemetery, with Glover painfully leaning into herniated punchlines like, ""She's an overachiever/ All she does is suck seed."" (Or maybe ""Asian girls everywhere... UCLA!"" will eventually end up on a T-shirt.) The bottle-service electro of ""Heartbeat"" could have been the 10th-funniest song on 808s & Heartbreak-- somewhere between ""The Coldest Winter"" and ""Love Lockdown""-- and it's actually trying for laughs. A few of Camp's tracks focus on more inspirational topics than ""making up for the fucks I missed in high school,"" but they usually emulate ""Jesus Walks"", or when trying to be slightly more humble,""Get By"". And any shred of relatability Glover establishes by reminiscing about sinkbaths with his cousin, or trying to fit into the white school his parents busted their asses to send him to, are cancelled out by R&B hooks so garish and impersonal they make Lupe Fiasco's Lasers sound dignified. Supporters may rush to praise Glover as a ""multi-talent"" due to Camp's self-production, but his cratedigging begins with The College Dropout and ends with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, all of it Blingee'd up with assistance from ""Community"" composer Ludwig Goransson. Yes, that's a lot of Yeezy talk, but the most insidious aspect of Camp is how Glover operates from a *pre-*Kanye inferiority complex where he senses that any dismissal of his music stems from gangsta rap still being the predominant aesthetic version of hip-hop (never mind that the most commercially relevant guy who can be feasibly be called ""gangsta rap"" right now is Rick Ross, and even he's widely beloved on account of being an acknowledged pathological liar). This much is obvious from the tone-deaf ""All of the Shine,"" and especially ""Backpackers"", a preemptive strike at his always-male, usually educated haters. Note how its title co-opts the one epithet more outdated than ""hipster"" in rap music circa 2011. Glover isn't strictly a comedy rapper, but he flows like a comic actor: When he's trying to be playful, his voice hitches in a pubescent squeak, and when he ""goes in,"" he's still delivering one room-clearing punchline after another with the earnestness of the most confused Rhymesayers guy ever. At the very least, Camp can serve as hashtag rap's tombstone, and I'll just present some choice quotes without comment so you can decide for yourself: ""I made the beat and murdered it, Casey Anthony,"" ""You can kiss my ass, Human Centipede,"" ""I got a girl on my arm, dude show respect/ Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech."" Every attempt Glover makes to present himself as an inside operative confounding stereotypes about mainstream rap rings totally false. In ""Fire Fly"", he brags about the ease of scoring college gigs and college girls (while rhyming ""LSU"" with ""molest you"") and then complains: ""No live shows because I can't find sponsors/ For the only black guy at a Sufjan concert."" Bullshit. OK, look: I realize that there's a chance some kid will hear that line and feel validated, and you know, the last thing we need is an armchair cracker like myself relating contrary anecdotal evidence about the demographics at Sufjan Stevens' last concert. So let's just look at the facts: Jay-Z and Beyoncé could be seen at Grizzly Bear shows in 2009, Justin Vernon has a free pass to jump on any track he chooses, and producers spent the year sampling Beach House, the xx, and Tame Impala. How does Glover explain Drake? Is he ""crazy or hood,"" or just a half-Jewish, former child actor from Toronto who's already sold 600,000 copies of Take Care while signed to Lil Wayne's record label? I mean, sub-major hip-hop isn't a post-cred, post-racial utopia by any means, but I can't think of another time when there were more options for listeners of just about any race or background seeking to identify with rappers on a non-allegorical level. I just have to assume Glover has completely ignored the success of Lil B, Main Attrakionz, Curren$y, Kendrick Lamar, Odd Future, Danny Brown, and especially Das Racist when he meekly moans, ""Is there room in the game for a lame that rhymes/ And wears short shorts and tells jokes sometimes?"" It's the perfect summation of Camp: preposterously self-obsessed, but not the least bit self-aware. Tell me that ain't insecure.","""Community"" star Donald Glover's fourth hip-hop collection-- the first with a commercial release-- is preposterously self-obsessed, but not the least bit self-aware.

El Camino,The Black Keys,by: Rob Harvilla,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2819d034d5c69bf4b9f/1:1/w_160/c5e871dc.jpeg,2011-12-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16098-el-camino/,Nonesuch,"It behooves us to take 90 seconds here and figure out how this band got so popular and enduring. The Black Keys were born in the teeth of the early-aughts ""Rock Is Back!"" movement, wherein a cadre of uncouth garage-y bands all named The ______s saved us from the terrorists and/or the Backstreet Boys. Eventual result: deserved ignominy (the Vines), undeserved ignominy (the Hives), bewildered near-implosion (the Strokes), and bewildering total implosion (the White Stripes). The years have not been kind. You didn't figure the Keys as sole survivors and mainstream lifers when The Big Come Up emerged in 2002 and offered a walking rockist orgasm: two gawky white dudes from Akron, Ohio, drums and surly guitar and burning-oatmeal-mouthed yawps of not terribly articulate romantic frustration, all powering cartoonishly virile garage-blues jams of prison-phone-call fidelity and sentiment. Ridiculous and kind of awesome. (This assumes racially uneasy cultural appropriation is no longer an issue for you, but if so, feel free to evoke the Blueshammer scene in the Ghost World movie and the hell with it.) And so. They named their second album Thickfreakness; they recorded their third album in an abandoned tire factory and named it Rubber Factory. For a while there, they always did confoundingly well in critics' polls, as though they were every single rock scribe's seventh-favorite band. They evolved incredibly slowly-- you can enjoy their early work tremendously and never retain five consecutive seconds of it beyond their cover of ""Have Love Will Travel"". Danger Mouse got involved as a producer, to the immediately evident benefit of no one. Coupla daffy side projects in there somewhere. (BlakRoc!) Ah yes, and they got their music in a shitload of ads, from Victoria's Secret to Zales to American Express to Subaru, like just so much capitalism, to the extent that they went on The Colbert Report with Vampire Weekend and clowned themselves about it. By which time they'd broken through. Last year's Brothers, their sixth album, had wit and pop charm and a minor hit in ""Tighten Up"" (and unremitting bloat, but ah), and thus came the Spin cover, the Saturday Night Live appearances, the Grammys. And now we greet El Camino, their best and (not coincidentally) goofiest album, a veritable frat-worthy ""Pimp 'n' Ho"" party in which T. Rex has somehow been tricked into serving as house band. The riffs are glam-nasty, the lyrics sublimely knuckleheaded, the basslines nimble and bombastic, the mood frivolous and fun and unabashedly corny. It's way shorter than Brothers, too. Sweet cars, witchy women, ""Gold on the Ceiling."" A bizarre attempt to philosophically combine the videos for ""Sabotage"" and ""Legs"". The fine line between a tricked-out GTO and ""GTFO."" Danger Mouse figured it out, for one thing. He unnecessarily arted up 2008's Attack & Release (plus the hit off Brothers), and his angelic-choir/space-glockenspiel Super Mario Galaxy fantasias still distract-- everything's a goddamn spaghetti western with this guy. But Camino's sonic frills are mercifully few, content to stick your head right in Patrick Carney's bass drum as he stomps through the caveman jam ""Hell of a Season"" with virtuosic anti-virtuosity, or revel in the machine-gun surge of Dan Auerbach's gong-banging guitar on surging opener ""Lonely Boy"". It's a shame Rock Band is no longer a thing. ""Gold on the Ceiling"" is just filthy, like George Thorogood scoring porn, all raunchy organ and licentious handclaps and chorus help from ladies attempting to sound like the sorts of ladies Steely Dan loved to write songs about. ""I wanna buy some time/ But don't have a dime,"" goes the raucous one called ""Money Maker"". Better cash some Subaru checks. The lyrics! The lyrics are hilarious. Great advice, via Brothers: ""Well, you can watch her strut/ But keep your mouth shut."" God bless Auerbach for ignoring it, and, amid the keening/crunching stomp of ""Run Right Back"", dropping some serious knowledge: ""Well she's a special thing/ She doesn't read too much, oh/ But there's no doubt/ She's written about."" Which is really just a prelude to the miraculous five-word sequence that is ""Finest exterior/ She's so superior,"" which, Jesus. Show me the CARFAX, Romeo. Your emotional climax is ""Little Black Submarines"", which starts acoustic and pathos-ridden: ""A broken heart is blind,"" goes the biologically suspect refrain. But then, hosanna, the distortion kicks in, the riff from ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" is lifted wholesale, and suddenly we are rocking, Carney and Auerbach in call-and-response/attack-and-release napalm mode, back in the rubber factory in spirit if not tax bracket. Yes, well. Consider El Camino the aural equivalent of one of those Chrysler ""Imported from Detroit"" ads where a $47,000 car slowly rolls through one of the most devastated cities in America, a sign for 8 Mile Road glimpsed through tinted windows: the finest in luxury grit. Seedy, escapist camp, crass but expert, so expert. That they're the true victors of the 2000s garage explosion is no shock at all. Rock came back. Commerce never left.","The Black Keys' seventh album features Danger Mouse's strongest production work for the group and a mood that's frivolous, fun, and unabashedly corny.

Big Bells and Dime Songs,Luke Roberts,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2795e6ef959693222df/1:1/w_160/6bb63619.jpeg,2011-12-01 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16090-big-bells-and-dime-songs/,Thrill Jockey,"Big Bells and Dime Songs, Luke Roberts' debut LP, was released by Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace in the spring of 2010; after a limited run, it received a relatively grander rollout this fall via Thrill Jockey. While the record wasn't reissued, exactly, Big Bells' unveiling was gradual-- which feels like a particularly appropriate beginning for Roberts, a deliberate and unhurried folk singer from Nashville. On first listen, Big Bells and Dime Songs can seem slight-- Roberts' guitar and vocals aren't augmented by much, save the occasional snare, some bass, or a snippet of electric organ or piano-- but their sparseness only amplifies the record's pervasive, echoing sadness. Big Bells is preoccupied with failures, emotional or otherwise: These are faithless laments, dirges for the nights when your glass is empty and no one's coming over. Roberts' vocals (which contain all the cackle of J Mascis and all the plaintiveness of Townes Van Zandt) are tender and bruised, and their smallness can be legitimately heartbreaking-- like on opener ""Somewhere to Run"", where Roberts blithely offers himself as a kind of last-call solace (""I'll be a hand to hold/ If I'm just a drunk who can't be true,"" he half-sings). Although folk music is frequently defined by its focus on narrative, Roberts' lyrics can be purposefully ambiguous, if not fully absurd (""I'm on a boat/ And if I only float,"" he announces in ""Unspotted Clothes""). Still, his oddball storytelling is unusually well-matched by his slow, methodical strums, and these songs move with purpose. The message is buried somewhere in all that empty space. ""Unspotted Clothes"" is the record's most unforgettable track, and also its most intricately arranged.  Roberts gives each syllable its own tragic weight, while a bit of drum and piano complement his guitar; the results are wistful, mysterious. The lingering ""Epcot Women"" showcases Roberts' penchant for fingerpicking, with the crags of his voice providing a compelling counterpoint to the cleanness of his playing. There's only one misstep: ""Just Do It Blues"" contains a puzzling evocation (""Heavens to Betsy/ Nigger knocking at the door""), and if there's descriptive justification for the usage, it's not entirely self-evident here. If pressed, Roberts might flash a few Americana bona-fides-- he was born in Nashville, but ran away from home to explore the U.S. via train, settling, for a while, in Brooklyn-- but unlike the bulk of the contemporary Americana canon, Big Bells is largely placeless. These songs are fiercely internal, which also makes them remarkably hard to shake-- here, Roberts is singing about the no-place of everyplace, the desolation we all know.","Nashville folksinger Luke Roberts' spare, affecting debut LP was inititally released in a limited run by Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace before this grander Thrill Jockey rollout.

Free All the Monsters,The Bats,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27dea9e61561daa692c/1:1/w_160/5f9a09ae.jpeg,2011-12-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16093-free-all-the-monsters/,Flying Nun,"Things move slowly in the world of beloved New Zealand band the Bats. 2012 will conclude their 30th year as a group, although they're not likely to be in any rush to celebrate that fact. After all, this is a group that took five years to release its debut full-length album (Daddy's Highway) and is only now issuing its eighth record, Free All the Monsters. The long gaps in the Bats' catalog can partly be attributed to singer/guitarist Robert Scott's presence as bassist in the Clean and his intermittent work as a solo artist, including his excellent 2010 album, Ends Run Together. Remarkably, despite long periods of inactivity, the band's original lineup of Scott plus singer/guitarist Kaye Woodward, bassist Paul Kean, and drummer Malcolm Grant remains intact. So too does that dreamy, disconsolate feeling that settles in whenever the Bats' best music takes hold and nimbly seeps under your skin. This relatively swift follow-up to 2008's The Guilty Office reunites the group with Flying Nun for the first time in over a decade, during a time when the legendary Christchurch label is celebrating its own 30th year in the business. It may be a stretch to imagine that realigning of forces caused the Bats to up their game, but this feels like their best record in years, possibly ever. Free All the Monsters simply consists of a set of plaintive songs that draw on all the stylistic cues this band has worked hard to establish in the past (a Byrds-ian jangle, a touch of Velvets-style dissonance) and tightens everything up a touch. Parallel feelings of warmth and longing criss-cross through much of the material, with songs like ""Long Halls"" and ""On the Bank"" bedded down in Kean's warmly looping basslines, while the vocals cut through the glow with a whole heap of self scrutiny. Most bands that put in the kind of time the Bats have accrued, either in their natural lives or through reunions, are trading off past glories by the time they hit this awkward middle-age stage. The language of rock simply doesn't lend itself well to concerns that arise once temples start thinning and paunches start widening-- with a few notable exceptions. Scott, it seems, is one of those irregular musicians, someone who has grappled with the aging process and managed to filter his thoughts and feelings on it into compelling material. It helps that he's able to fasten his wistful mindset to a broad base of musical ideas, whether it's in the lilting pop of his co-vocal duties with Woodward on ""Free All the Monsters"" and ""Fingers of Dawn"" or through the meditative exhaust-fume growl of ""In the Subway"". On the beautifully barren instrumental ""Canopy"" there's no need for words, with the Bats overlapping, keening guitar lines that perfectly sink into the pensive undercurrent of the rest of the album. The nostalgic ""Spacejunk"" works as a précis of the unusual place the Bats find themselves in, with Scott hinting at his malaise (""direction is hard to find"") and indicating how he gets over it (""time is the healer""). That notion of using time to overcome, to iron out kinks, not to rush into resolution or hasty decision-making is why this group has an album on their hands that effortlessly builds on everything that came before. It's an old-fashioned approach in the internet age, but it's better to think of the Bats as a band that's completely out of time, operating in a space (and at a pace) of its own volition. On Free All the Monsters, that place is full of familiar concerns-- woebegone angst, rumination on a life that could have turned out differently, the brutally quick passage of time. It's a bittersweet corner of the world that the Bats have patiently chipped away at over their long history, but on this record it feels like they're gaining a head of steam instead of resting on any laurels.","Now in their 30th year, the New Zealand mainstays release their eighth album on their old label Flying Nun. It's their best record in years, possibly ever.

Works: Selected Remixes 2006-2010,Radio Slave,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2669d034d5c69bf4b77/1:1/w_160/4afa1678.jpeg,2011-12-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16087-works-selected-remixes-2006-2010/,Rekids,"""Formula"" can be a bad word when it comes to music, but it needn't be. It's really just another term for ""recipe"" or ""rules,"" and rules are what make particular types of music work the way they do. The blues is a formula. The sonata's a formula. And in house and techno, the four-to-the-floor kick is a formula, the one that makes it all click together like Legos. There are many such formulae in dance music; we could also just call them conventions. A lot of these conventions have to do with accommodating DJs, like 16-bar intros with little more than a steady kick and a hint of the tune to come, to facilitate mixing into the track that's finishing, or 16-bar outros that have been similarly thinned out to pave the way for the next succession of stepping stones. Some formulae are less about the DJ than the listener, less functional than musically intuitive-- like a drum fill across the last few beats of the fourth bar, to send us hurtling into the next phrase, or a filter sweep at the end of a long breakdown, to build tension before the music returns at full power. These things can easily degenerate into cliché, as evidenced by the current crop of maximum-strength electro-house being flogged across stadium raves and super clubs, in which every functional trope is super-sized to the verge of self-parody. But in the hands of a producer like Radio Slave, the formula becomes the material itself. The form becomes the content. This is one of the main things you'll take away from Works: Selected Remixes 2006-2010, a collection of the Berlin-based producer Matt Edwards' remix work for artists like UNKLE, Trentemøller, Minilogue, and Roman Flügel's Soylent Green. It's an impressive-- some might say daunting-- collection. There are only 22 tracks, but with the average length of around 10 minutes, they take up three CDs and nearly four hours' listening time. As compilations go, the list of artists remixed suggests a wide stretch of stylistic ground: Edwards tackles not just the work of like-minded dance artists like Len Faki, Mr. G, and Peace Division but also winsome indie pop from Mlle Caro & Franck Garcia and an Arthur Russell cover by alt-R&B types Yam Who?. (Even the Cult's Ian Astbury wails his way into the mix, via UNKLE's ""Burn My Shadow"".) But as disparate as the source material can be, a remarkable uniformity prevails across the remixes. As Radio Slave, Edwards essentially does one groove. (He explores other styles under aliases like Rekid, Cabin Fever, and the Machine, and in the duo Quiet Village.) It's a rolling, gliding, tech-house cadence built upon sturdy kick drums and immaculately carved hi-hats, so cleanly cut they might be a jeweler's work. It's the archetypal house groove, with shakers and hi-hats on the upbeats and claps on the 2 and 4; every new track feels like a variation upon the last. It's a formula, but Edwards is a master of tweaking the internal proportions, sliding elements forward or backward against the beat to give it a sense of swing. He threads ostinato tones through the upper register like a guy wire, a taut line arrowing off toward the horizon and from which every other element hangs. He favors dry claps and snares to accentuate the cavernous empty space between the beats, and the bass is more felt than heard: rarely could it be called a ""line,"" just the moody cushion on which everything nervously rests. He deploys syncopated toms or chord stabs, often buried subliminally deep in the mix, to add even more tension. And he knows how to draw out a phrase for 16 or 32 bars, sketching broad arcs over rhythms that seem never to change, as though teasing the course of time itself. Virtually every track here, at once languid and tightly wound, is a master class in what makes this particular kind of groove tick. Across the 22 tracks, these tropes reappear so often that it's hard to tell whether they're tactics or tics. So I tried a little experiment. I was inspired by something I found on SoundCloud the other day. Created by a Britsh artist named Paul Chivers (aka ramjac), it's called ""All Together Now: Everything the Beatles Ever Did"", and that's exactly what it is: ""Every Beatles tune, played together, sequenced in order of lengths, with the longest starting first and all 226 tunes ending together,"" as Chivers explains in his description. It begins with the familiar loops of ""Revolution 9"" and culminates in a maelstrom that might send Merzbow running for cover. It's a neat conceptual joke, but it also says something about the proportions of the Beatles' own chosen forms, and the way they grew out of them. I wanted to see how well Radio Slave's remixes conform to an ideal type, so I dragged all seven tracks from the first CD of Works into Ableton Live, a music-production and sequencing application. I changed the tempos of the individual tracks slightly so that the beats were lined up, all of them beginning together, and I hit ""Play."" The result sounded remarkably like one single track-- or, at most, a mixed passage in a DJ set, where both tracks are at full volume. There are key clashes galore, but that's not the point-- what's striking is how perfectly all the rhythmic elements line up. And, beyond that, how closely the tracks mirror each other in structure, swelling and fading in lockstep. Voices from disparate songs-- Ian Astbury, Mlle Caro, the singer from Trentemøller's ""Moan""-- are teased in at roughly the same points in the composite track, a pile of codas upon codas. The fadeout is a uniform decrescendo. The shape of Edwards' ideal form burns like a filament in a dimly lit room. The results reminded me of Idris Khan's superimposed collages of the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher, photographers obsessed with documenting archetypal architectural forms. All of that, and still: If you were at a club and heard this coming from the speakers, you'd probably think, ""Hm, a little busy, but it works."" All of this isn't to reduce Radio Slave's remix work to a caricature-- quite the opposite. (Not everything on the compilation follows the pattern: ""Go Bang"", the Arthur Russell rework, is a glorious mess of unhinged disco, and Edwards' remix of Nelski's ""Body Pop"" pairs Latin pianos with dub chords to collapse New York's Body and Soul into Berlin's Panorama Bar-- a superimposition of a very different sort.) In fact, the experiment actually increased my appreciation for Edwards' craft. It's not easy to be this consistent without bogging down in old habits. No matter how formally similar each track may be, the best of them-- like his remixes of Soylent Green's ""La Forza Del Destino"", Matt O'Brien's ""Serotone"", and Mr. G's ""Sometimes I Cry""-- jump out of the speakers with rare intensity. You may not always be able to ID them, but if you've heard them on a dance floor, you know them in your bones.","On this 3xCD, nearly four-hour collection featuring Berlin-based producer Matt Edwards' remix work of artists like UNKLE, Trentemøller, Minilogue, and Roman Flügel's Soylent Green, the formula becomes the material.

Ersatz G.B.,The Fall,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b270c0084474cd0c1f8f/1:1/w_160/2c174fb3.jpeg,2011-12-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16081-the-fall-ersatz-gb/,Cherry Red,"When John Peel said that he was incapable of telling if the Fall had ever made a bad record, that had something to do with the fact that they mostly hadn't until fairly recently, and more to do with the spell that Mark E. Smith's unwavering attitude casts over the faithful. There's no other sound like Smith's spittle-flecked snarl, and no other lyrical sensibility like his; he's never allowed the Fall to rest on its history, or its listeners to get too comfortable. But that's not the same thing as saying that the Fall are incapable of making a bad record, and although a lot of their discography is difficult but rewarding, their 15,000th album Ersatz G.B.'s abrasiveness, inscrutability, and tedium are increasingly tough to take with repeated close listening. So it raises a couple of questions, such as: What would a total failure of a Fall album sound like, and how would that be different from this one? And what does it mean when it's impossible to tell a band's new record from a weak parody of what they've been up to for the past few years? One way that the Fall could go wrong, for instance, if that were possible, would be for their music to fall off. Despite Smith's insistence that he's the only important member, he used to have bandmates who were distinctive musicians-- Brix, Steve Hanley, Marc Riley, the Mouse on Mars guys. These days, he has to work with musicians who will put up with what being in the Fall in the 21st century entails. The lineup on Ersatz G.B., as it happens, is the same as on the last couple of albums, but it could be yet another anonymous pickup crew-- and if you removed Smith's vocals from it, it would be a nearly irredeemable, almost totally generic hard rock record. The riff of ""Greenway"" is, in fact, copped from Greek comedy-metal band Anorimoi's ""Gameboy"", except that the current edition of the Fall doesn't have anything like Anorimoi's precision and bite. And Smith? How could a record with him on it ever go entirely awry? Well, he's still Mark E. Smith-- there are always developments to follow. He's got a new voice he uses on a few songs, a death-rattle gargle-growl; as usual, there are a couple of WTF lyrical moments, especially ""Nate Will Not Return"", in which Smith sees how many rhymes he can force with the name of the Gossip Girl character. And there are still a few drops to be milked out of Smith's favorite tricks: mocking middlebrow culture, dragging ""un-songlike"" diction and fun-to-pronounce proper nouns into song lyrics, fracturing the meaning of a sentence mid-phrase. (One line in ""Mask Search"", possibly the best-enunciated on the album, does all of those things: ""I'm so sick of Snow Patrol/ And where to find Esso lubricant/ And mobile number."") At this point, though, the band's music is so pro forma that most of his lyrics could be applied to any track here with no significant difference. ""I've Seen Them Come"" is an idea for an intriguing 20-second passage of a song, stretched out to an unbearable six minutes. ""Age of Chang"" features a tinny condenser-mic recording accompanied by the properly recorded band, which would be a clever idea if Smith hadn't already recorded ""Paintwork"" more than 25 years ago. When ""Happi Song"" turns up halfway through, it's a relief to not hear Smith out front for a few minutes-- it's a sweet, simple tune written by keyboardist Eleni Poulou, and sung by her in a fragile, thickly accented voice (with Smith occasionally making unpleasant noises in the background). If you believe the Fall are incapable of badness by virtue of their singularity, then here you go; Smith's Mancunian sneer will always raise a Pavlovian response for those of us who are used to its signaling genius. But hold this shabby, grueling album up next to Hex Enduction Hour or Bend Sinister or The Marshall Suite or any number of the great, challenging records the Fall made when they were challenging themselves, too, and it falls apart.","The Fall's 29th studio album raises questions, like: What would a total failure of a Fall album sound like, and how would that be different from this one?

Radioactive,Yelawolf,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27b5e6ef959693222e1/1:1/w_160/955ce10c.jpeg,2011-12-01 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16092-radioactive/,DGCInterscopeShadyGhet-O-Vision,"There's a curious moment at the end of the sixth track on Yelawolf's major-label debut. It's ""Throw It Up"", one of the album's highlights. After the song ends, there's a skit where Yelawolf and his boss, Eminem, discuss the course of the album. Eminem tells Yelawolf that the album needs songs for women, love songs specifically. Yela, for his part, feigns protest. It's presented as a conversation that any label head might have with an artist, but including it on the album is a bizarre and remarkably cynical move. It's unclear whether it's presented as a warning, an apology, a cop-out, or all three, but it more importantly marks exactly where a potentially great album starts to go off the rails. The idea of ""crossing over"" is something almost every rapper at a major label has to deal with. Making songs about, and for, women-- be it about love or dancing-- to gain popularity is a move about as old as the genre itself. For some rappers, it's a seamless transition. For others, it's not. It can be frustrating and dispiriting to watch the formula applied to a career that has yet to take shape, though it's a process everyone more or less knows is coming. It's also a route that can be rejected (a recent obvious example being Odd Future) or navigated deftly (""No Hands"" didn't lose Waka Flocka any cred). Or, I guess, one can take the path Yelawolf chose, to lamely act as if you're a prisoner of a system that you chose to enter and make half-assed songs as if sentenced by law. And with that rehearsed conversation with Eminem about making love songs for women, Yelawolf is trying to absolve himself from the responsibility of about one-third of Radioactive being decidedly half-assed. The middle of the album (featuring hooks from the likes of Priscilla Renea and Fefe Dobson) is far and away the worst music of Yelawolf's career, and he knows it. His rapping is passable, but the beats are leaden and uninspired and the hooks are about as canned as possible. It's hard to imagine what the market for those songs is, really-- I can't imagine that Yelawolf's female fans want to hear him rap about conventional romance, or want to hear a potentially good song about blue-collar American life drowned in a syrupy chorus. The worst part isn't the songs themselves, but that the album didn't have to go this route. Outside the sagging middle section, the subject matter and production will be nothing new to those familiar with Yela's music; his voice and perspective remain sharp and unique, and he certainly hasn't lost any of his technical skill. The guests (Mystikal, Killer Mike, Three 6 Mafia secret weapon Gangsta Boo) are also otherwise the type of people that should be on a Yelawolf album, rappers from whom he pulls his vocal style or sharp wit, or to whom his fans likely also listen. (There is a frame of a great album here, and in the age of selective iTunes playlisting, maybe the regrettable portion of the album is merely just forgettable.) This isn't Yelawolf's first foray into trying to make pop songs or songs for women, but it's by far his worst. His previous albums-- last year's Trunk Muzik and its repackaged follow-up Trunk Muizk: 0-60-- showcased an ability and an affinity for pop songwriting that could've been fostered and encouraged here instead of being shelved for industry cast-offs. And then there is ""Let's Roll"", the song with Kid Rock that unexpectedly shows exactly how the formula can go right. Whether it equals pop success remains to be seen, but it's a collaboration that plays to both artists' strengths. As country boys at heart with an interest in both rap and rock, Yela and Kid Rock are arguably closer kindred spirits than Yela and Eminem, despite the tongue-twisting rapping. ""Let's Roll"" asks Rock to sing a conventional rap hook over a conventional rap beat, but the crux is in the grittiness and twang that Rock brings to the track, which dovetails perfectly with Yela's imagery of life as a rebel in Alabama. It's an inspired pairing, one that amounts to one of the best songs of Yelawolf's career, and it holds a mirror up to the four or five insipid crossover attempts that come later.","On Yelawolf's major label debut-- featuring guest spots from Eminem, Mystikal, Killer Mike, and Kid Rock, among others-- the Alabama rapper's attempts at crossing over make a potentially great album go off the rails.

Starting Over,Dwarr,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b267ea9e61561daa6904/1:1/w_160/f75db97b.jpeg,2011-11-30 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16088-starting-over/,Drag CityYoga,"Privately pressed records can be dodgy propositions; if you've ever tittered at a high school marching band's LP, or wondered about that bearded, bespectacled, finger-picking guy pictured on the back of a hand-drawn sleeve from the early 1970s while thumbing the dollar bin of a record store, you know this to be the case. At their absolute worst, these self-published albums are tin-eared things (and invariably tied to local parishes). A select few-- like the kind of Midwest soul and funk oddities that the mindful reissue Numero label constantly unearths-- are redeemable listens. Yet only a few private-press records ever offer portals into alternate realities. That west coast Yoga Records imprint mostly dabbles in the latter, be it Traveler's Advisory, the beguiling hammer dulcimer-drum machine album from Matthew Young or Ted Lucas' lonesome and stoned folk album. So it's no question that the peculiar strain of heavy metal that Duane Warr recorded to a Tascam eight-track in 1984 while living inside his trailer in Columbia, South Carolina, is a portal to another realm. Dwarr, the one-man band of Warr's, goes to a dark alley in the psyche that few ever feel the need to wander, much less record and overdub-- crafting hand-drawn album art as well as homemade videos for certain songs (not to mention pressing up and distributing, only to be unable to sell them). Warr home-recorded and self-released both 1984's oddly-titled debut Starting Over and 1986's Animals, before a divorce and spiritually harrowing time led to a breakdown and to Warr's becoming a born-again Christian. With a continued fascination with Norwegian black metal, it makes sense that a rarity such as Dwarr should blip back for recent metal converts. Last year, Yoga (in conjunction with Drag City) re-released Animals, which, despite having a cannibal-populated landscape for a cover, sank without much fanfare. Now follows Starting Over, which is, alas, the weaker of the two albums. Dwarr's records are harrowing experiences, both in their tone and listenability, but despite a visual and aural aspect that seems to forecast doom and black metal, Dwarr never feels quite that dark and depraved. Despite what it predicts for the future of metal, it's genealogy still consists of Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Tarkus, and Black Sabbath. From the looks of Starting Over-- whose cover art exists somewhere between Planet of the Apes' Statue of Liberty, The Shining's flood of blood, and whatever that hesher in your high school art class used to always draw on looseleaf-- this should be an evil, teenage suicide-enabling shredder record of the highest echelon. Only, in the greater scheme of things, Dwarr's music isn't like that. While electric guitar shredding is the focus, this isn't satanic, apocalyptic doom heavy metal-- in its weird warped way, it's Christian folk. The greatest example of Dwarr and his particular kind of genius can be found in the video he shot and edited himself for ""Screams of Terror"", the second song on Starting Over. It conveys his gifts more than making the music can. What else can be genuinely campy and haunting, then campy again, but then bone-chilling by video's end? ""You know you're going straight to hell/ And if you don't straighten your life/ You'll have an endless plight,"" Warr intones on the lugubrious, doorbell-chimed tune, delivering his lyrics in that portentous Roger Waters whisper. Its early lines invoke that dread children feel in the dark, but Warr's lyrics ultimately veer towards a pat Christian morality, despite the monsters and skull paint. Even if at this phase of his life he's only into the damnation and sulfur parts of the Bible, returning to his religion seems inevitable in hindsight. He cites the Book of Job directly on the brooding ""Job's Revenge"", though ""brooding"" isn't much of a descriptor when it could describe every aspect of the music. Here he reads from Job 5:2-9 during breaks from a 12-bar blues melody with a rote guitar solo on top. Too often, Warr delivers his lines and plays his parts without much variance. The best moments of the album come when Warr is at his most overt in his worship of Black Sabbath (rather than trying to conjure the ghost of Randy Rhoads via his Eddie Van Halen splatter guitar), as he does on ""Cannabinol: the Elation"". Only on furious closer ""I've Been Thinking"", where Warr's guitar cops the ""Sweet Leaf"" power chords and Ozzy's strangulated voice can one imagine a world where a heavy metal god isn't turned into a reality show punchline.","While electric guitar shredding is the focus of the music Duane Warr recorded inside his trailer in 1984, this isn't satanic, apocalyptic heavy metal-- it's Christian folk.

Sacred & Profane Love EP,Maria Minerva,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2725e6ef959693222d0/1:1/w_160/0bcb7744.jpeg,2011-11-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16079-maria-minerva-sacred-profane-love-ep/,100% Silk,"Bedroom-disco chanteuse Maria Minerva has put out four releases this year, the most recent of which was called Cabaret Cixous, after the French post-structuralist feminist theorist Hélène Cixous. Given the facts that generally circulate about Minerva, aka Maria Juur-- she studied cultural theory, she is interested in deconstructing ideas about female sexuality, she reads books-- it's easy to imagine that the fourth track on her new Sacred & Profane Love EP, ""Another Time and Place"", takes its name from a semi-obscure philosophical tract, à la John Maus' We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves. Actually, it's Britney Spears. Over the track's pulsating, murky beat, Maria lifts a question Spears posed in 2001's ""I'm a Slave 4 U"": ""Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me/ Until another time and place?"" Sacred & Profane Love is Minerva's most immediate release yet, but it picks up on her other records' ideas: Her music is a place where academia and pop culture, tastefulness and excess, dominance and submission, and yes, Hélène Cixous and Britney Spears, all commingle in a hazy, libidinous swirl. The EP's centerpiece is the terrific ""Gloria"", a hypnagogic earworm about corporeal and spiritual bliss: ""Darling, when you touch me/ I feel like I've been touched by the hands of God."" Lest the title deceive you, know that we're a long way from Patti Smith's gravely barroom stomp: This ""Gloria"" swoons and ripples like a reflection in water. Another clear highlight is ""Turn Me On (Working on Full Powwa)"", which features a playful, muffled vocal and a driving beat. The bookends ""A Love So Strong"" and the closing reprise ""Luv So Strong"" aren't quite as compelling but they add a cohesion to the EP's atmosphere, making Sacred & Profane feel like an ecstatic, 30-minute journey to another time and place-- one that makes even familiar pop lyrics distend like musings on power relations and time travel. Minerva's music remains rough around the edges, and some listeners might wish she'd appropriate the clarity of the more mainstream pop that inspires her-- but that's clearly not her aim. ""I'm exploring the idea of the 'female loser,'"" Minerva has said about her conceptual approach. You get the feeling you've heard Taylor Swift or the dude behind LonelyGirl15 say the exact same thing, but what's so refreshing about Minerva's sound-- along with that of artists like Grimes or U.S. Girls, who are also using DIY dance music to make comments about femininity and alienation in the digital age-- is that it bespeaks a sense of isolation and anxiety that feels refreshingly, and even unsettlingly, authentic. Still, even though it's true to her aesthetic, Sacred & Profane Love certainly feels like a progression. It's the first of her releases on which the impulse to think or feel takes a backseat-- more than anything this is a record that wants to see you move.","As heard on her newest EP, Maria Juur's music is a place where academia and pop culture commingle in a hazy, libidinous swirl.

Brumalia EP,Patrick Wolf,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27cea9e61561daa6928/1:1/w_160/548007ed.jpeg,2011-11-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16091-brumalia-ep/,Hideout,"Bait: Following this year's blindingly sunny Lupercalia and the clip for ""The City"" that had Patrick Wolf uncharacteristically gallivanting about on a Santa Monica beach, the Brumalia EP sounds seasonally appropriate for its late-November release. Switch: It sounds more appropriate for the holiday season, as opposed to the winter. Though there's incontrovertible proof that Wolf is long past trying to recreate the shadowy allure of his first two LPs, I gotta admit to hoping he'd bundle up in black again to at least reconcile his pop impulses with the gothic, brooding exaggerations of his youth. For the most part, Brumalia-- which translates to ""festival of the shortest day""-- does let some blustery weather in, but sonically, it's on par with Lupercalia and The Bachelor, so it's not barren trees and howling winds so much as ostentatious Christmas light fixtures in the pure, driven snow. Whereas Lupercalia was inspired by the giddiness of a real-life romantic partnership, Wolf sidesteps straight biography to reacquaint himself with instruments, samples, and memories he literally found lying around: A long-dormant theremin seeps through the stately pulse of ""Bitten"", the percussion underpinning ""Nemoralia"" is cobbled together from news footage of London's summer riots, the words of ""Jerusalem"" were adapted from William Blake, while the confessional lyrics of ""Trust"" are straight from Wolf's diary. Though they're as lavishly produced as his proper records, the little sonic footnotes and specificity give Brumalia a demo-level, real-time immediacy that rarely comes through despite his gregarious persona. Problem is that it begs the question of how exactly to evaluate the positive effects of Wolf's over-sharing: Does prior knowledge of Brumalia's themes and history somehow lessen the value of its contents without it? Perhaps, since rather than using its brevity as a means of cohesion, Brumalia finds Wolf with a batch of songs unsure of what impression it wants to leave-- other than being a sonic appendage to Lupercalia, itself an uneven record. That said, ""Together"" is helped by its new context-- previously, its plainspoken hook (""And I can do this alone/ But we can do this so much better... together"") felt like just another example of Wolf laying it on too thick, but amidst Brumalia's facially darker lyrical content, its contentment at least feels a bit more earned and its opulent disco pulse more striking. Meanwhile, a see-sawing violin riff and an empathetic appraisal of addiction make ""Bitten"" as instantly ingratiating as recent Wolf singles such as ""The City"" or ""Accident & Emergency"" without the unctuous salesmanship. But like Lupercalia, an auspicious and cohesive start gives way to Wolf sitting uneasily between the poles of his nocturnal mood-setting and major-key wooing. ""Pelicans"" is novel enough as Wolf's first iPad composition as well as a song with an overtly American geography, but without the occasional landmark, it's as turgid as the Florida swamps serving as its inspiration. Meanwhile, centerpiece ""This Time of Year"" goes further into Kevin Rowland fixation, but by trying to double as a Christmas card and an anti-war protest, Wolf's pen strains way too hard to purple up lyrics like ""How many crosses more must we stigmata our soil with/ Until we reveal the blood on our hands?"" And yet, Wolf still remains at least theoretically fascinating because he tries too hard, his artistic stumbles more often revealing a misdirection of ambition and talent than limitations. But is it just a matter of Wind in the Wires diehards not getting what they want? It's not that simple: Like Lupercalia, Brumalia uses Wolf's own experience to craft something that's more sonically and thematically universal. And yet, these supposed tensions don't end up feeling particularly tense or rife with possibility like Wolf's best work. As such, Brumalia ends up being as frustrating as his previous albums because Wolf appears capable of giving us anything to the point where comfort is not enough.","Though as lavishly produced as his other material, little sonic footnotes give this holiday-season-appropriate EP a real-time immediacy.

Live in New York,Twilight Singers,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26c13d197565213a780/1:1/w_160/9a800673.jpeg,2011-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16083-the-twilight-singers/,Infernal,"If men are indeed pigs, then Greg Dulli's body of work amounts to a veritable slaughterhouse. And yet, his talent lies not only in his unwavering ability to deconstruct the male ego, but also translating all that psychological tumult and turmoil into rapturous, crowd-pleasing live entertainment. Debuting in 2000 with an album produced by UK downtempo dons Fila Brazillia, the Twilight Singers were initially conceived as a low-key counterpoint to Dulli's more frenetic previous band, the Afghan Whigs. But over the past decade, thanks to an ever-expanding and rotating cast of collaborators, Dulli has effectively built up the Twilight Singers into a more elaborate rendering of the Afghan Whigs' rock-noir vision, enhancing the cinematic quality of the Whigs' mid-1990s catalog and honoring their reputation for breathless, soul-revue style performances that go on for hours. By feeding Dulli's unsavory songbook through all manner of medleys, impromptu covers, and crowd-participation gambits, the Twilight Singers have essentially become the Bad Seeds by way of Prince-- emotional devastation you can dance to. All of which makes the Twilight Singers' first live album less of a stop-gap cash-grab than a long-overdue inevitability. And like the canonical, career-making concert documents of the 1970s, Live in New York-- recorded last May at Webster Hall, on a Friday the 13th-- works both as a super-fan keepsake and a gateway for newcomers into Dulli's dense discography. The carefully plotted presentation and weighty nature of Twilight Singers albums-- not to mention Dulli's unvarnished, raw rasp of a voice-- can make them a foreboding proposition for some, but Live in New York eases the entry process with a representative sampling of high points from the band's five albums (albeit, unsurprisingly, with a particular emphasis on this year's Dynamite Steps) while giving shine to a quality not often heard on the band's recordings-- Dulli's gregarious personality, which sees him eagerly playing the master of ceremonies to his own breakdown. Though Live in New York spreads 21 songs over two CDs (the digital version features only 19), it shows that Dulli essentially works in three modes: swaggering, nocturnal rockers; desolate break-of-dawn ballads; and gradually intensifying epics that bridge the gap between the two. His gift as a performer thus lies in knowing when to deploy each. Unlike most live albums, Live in New York's CD version presents a complete, unedited concert, but one with perfectly paced ebbs and flows, as songs are radically rearranged and/or grouped together into seamless mini-suites. Dulli is especially aware of how his various songs can complement or even bolster one another through association-- early on, the tension established by Dynamite Steps' slow-boiling ""Blackbird and the Fox"" explodes into a ferocious ""I'm Ready"" (off 2006's Powder Burns) as if they were two parts of the same song, while the set hits a fever pitch two-thirds in with raging revamps of ""Love"" and ""Annie Mae"" (from 2000's Twilight as Played by the Twilight Singers) that highlight the crucial role of Rick Nelson's piano-pounding and Greg Wieczorek's crashing drums to the band's widescreen sound. Naturally, this mixtape approach to his own discography extends to Dulli's incorporating quotes from other artists' work. Dulli's no stranger to recontextualizing innocent pop songs for more devious ends-- ""Forty Dollars"" shrewdly swipes lines from the Beatles' ""She Loves You"" and ""All You Need Is Love"" to depict a transaction with a prostitute-- but in concert, this instinct goes into overdrive, whether it's using Carl Carlton's 1970s soul classic ""Everlasting Love"" as the closing refrain on ""Esta Noche"" or dropping ""Hey Ya!""-inspired ""I'm just being honest"" ad libs in ""Forty Dollars"" (not to mention a snippet of the Whigs' ""Rebirth of the Cool"" on ""Never Seen No Devil""). Partway through Live In New York, Dulli even interrupts one cover song (Martina Topley-Bird's ""Too Tough to Die"", which is available only on the CD version) to start another, as he slinks into the audience to lead a mass, off-mic sing-along of Tom Petty's ""Breakdown"". Compared to Dulli's other acts of reappropriation, the Petty theft initially seems less purposeful, and more like frivolous, crowd-baiting shtick. But, in hearing how quickly the audience picks up on Dulli's lead, it ultimately provides a perfect snapshot of how, at a Twilight Singers show, one man's anguish can so easily be elevated into communal, celebratory catharsis.","Like canonical, career-making concert documents of the 1970s, this 2xCD live album recorded last May at Webster Hall works both as a super-fan keepsake and a gateway for newcomers into Greg Dulli's dense post-Afghan Whigs discography.

Nothing EP,Zomby,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b269b1335d7bf169a41c/1:1/w_160/c14d9588.jpeg,2011-11-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16086-nothing/,4AD,"Don't let the title or post-album late-year timing fool you-- there are plenty of good things happening on Nothing.  While it sounds like it was taken from the same creative burst that birthed London producer Zomby's recent LP Dedication, here that album's glum funereality gets an almost dance-friendly makeover. With its classic-sounding jungle breaks and ragga vocal samples, opener ""Labyrinth"" immediately recalls Zomby's vaguely conceptual throwback debut Where Were U in '92?, though drenched in noir melancholy. The breaks stutter and sputter, the perfunctory chord progression is oddly defeatist, and the characteristic airhorns are mockingly empty and peripheral: Breakbeat 'ardkore never sounded this tormented. That's not to say Nothing isn't ever upbeat or danceable-- it's tinged with Dedication's air of quiet, nocturnal introspection but not shackled by its thematic bent or album-oriented sequencing. Thus we get seven shades of Zomby, and even if they're basically different shades of gray, it's exciting to hear him branch out. He tries something new on the unusually dissolute ""Trapdoor"", where grainy synths billow over scattershot percussion that has more to do with footwork than Zomby's usual hardcore continuum. ""Digital Fractal"" and ""Equinox"" take the pseudo-garage bounce of older tracks like ""Tarantula"" and turn it somber in two different ways: ""Fractal"" plays with dulcet, mournful tones and shrouds its cycling arpeggios in reverb so they sound like they're off in the distance, lost in a fog, while the shimmering ""Equinox"" sucks that echo chamber dry, all crisply slicing snares and tactile hand percussion. It's a brilliant realism often missing from an artist whose work is expressed through glassy, artificial textures or borrowed tropes from extinct genres. Those extinct genres make a determined comeback on Nothing, however, and Zomby's take on them is stronger than ever. ""Sens"" toys gently with its breaks, carefully placing them in the white space of a melody caught between jerky and jilted, and ""Ecstasy Versions"" transitions from a hesitant breakbeat crawler into full-on jungle. Even here, again Zomby's morose melodicism takes center stage, a track more about its sadly cooing vocals-- a common sample source sullied and sullen-- and bleepy melody than the flashy, distracting breaks that should be the center of attention. It's like he's proving once and for all that Where Were U in '92? wasn't just a transparent exercise, blending his hardcore copycat tracks with his more personal, idiosyncratic tendencies. The Nothing EP was originally included as an appendage to the Japanese edition of Dedication, so it seems almost certain that these were leftovers from the album. But it says a lot about the strength of these tracks-- and Zomby's preternatural propensity for prolific greatness-- that the seven odds and sods on Nothing make for such a strong whole. It's not quite the sound of Zomby having fun-- this music is still too dark for that-- but it's Zomby being his usual tangential self again, after bearing the constraints of a second cohesive album. He recently tweeted: ""jungle is going to come back hard, mark my words, it might be five years from now but we will witness a new great age of jungle in England."" This sounds like the excitable mouthing-off of a delusional purist, but really, with visionary artists like Zomby behind a potential new wave of the stuff, it's hard not to wonder if he could be right.","While this seven-song EP sounds like it was birthed from the same creative wavelength as the London producer's recent LP Dedication, here the album's glum funereality gets an almost dance-friendly makeover.

Classic,M.E.D.,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b275b1335d7bf169a42c/1:1/w_160/d6ad8107.jpeg,2011-11-29 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16076-med-classic/,Stones Throw,"M.E.D. is the rap equivalent of a middle-relief pitcher asked to go eight innings. He's left his mark in small doses on Madlib-produced tracks-- Lootpack's ""Level Zero"" and ""Wanna Test""; Quasimoto's ""24-7""; Madvillain's ""Raid""-- but his 2005 full-length debut Push Comes to Shove revealed his limitations in short order. He's never been the most distinguishable member of the Stones Throw camp, for good or for bad: The same thing that's kept him from setting himself apart has also generally kept him from the embarrassments that happen when an MC's ambition outstrips his inspiration. He just punches the clock, drops in for 14 tracks, then punches out again, rapping like a man who keeps his head down and just goes through the motions, as though doing otherwise would get him fired. That the title is the most egregious thing about Classic is something of a minor relief, though it's also a good way to bait critics looking for something else to say about an album without much personality to it. (I'll bite: ""more like Adequate."") The usual themes come up in his lyrics-- sex (""JWF""), weed (""Medical Card""), regional pride (""Where I'm From"")-- and the common universality of his experiences and perspectives on these well-worn topics are relatable at the expense of being actually unique. Occasionally he'll hit on something like ""Blaxican"", which conflates the parallel civil rights struggles in his background, and leaves you wondering just what more he might have to say outside the confines of his indistinct lyrical style. But it's M.E.D.'s emphasis on technique over everything else that holds this album back. His voice is largely flat and affectless, letting the words do all the work of selling an attitude that should otherwise come through in inflections. And those words don't carry enough weight on their own; there's so much reliance on internal rhymes and assonance in his style that he's sacrificed being quotable for being listenable. But he's at least got a delivery that fuses well to the beat and doesn't get in the way of the production enough to detract from it-- sometimes, it's the other way around, as when a sampled vocal drop on closer ""Magical Mystical"" actually drowns him out mid-verse. (By that point, it's hard to feel like you've missed something.) In situations like this, it's best to approach an album at this level as a sort of beat tape with added vocal augmentation. A lot of Classic's appeal comes from the heavy Madlib involvement, and his productions here work well as a tidied-up take on the resin-caked density of his latter-day Medicine Show and Beat Konducta entries. The Tesla-coil keyboards of Kurupt/Planet Asia-featuring subwoofer anthem ""Roll Out"" and the stripped-down, dirtied-up drums on Hodgy Beats collab ""Outta Control"" are key highlights. For good measure you can throw in a tension-building violin-tinged Alchemist beat on ""War & Love"", Oh No delivering no-bullshit choppy organ funk on ""Where I'm From"", Karriem Riggins wringing some nice belated summer vibes off the jazz guitar-driven title track, and Georgia Anne Muldrow injecting her eccentric but richly realized neo-soul sensibility into ""INT'L"". It's another solid case study in what makes the Stones Throw aesthetic so appealing to the traditionalist-meets-futurist indie-rap crossover crowd. That sound just has a lot of blanks to fill in: The MC shortened his name from Medaphor to an acronym a long time ago, but it's still not clear whether M.E.D. actually stands for anything.","The journeyman rapper's latest for Stones Throw is best heard as a beat tape with added vocal augmentation, as much of its appeal comes from the heavy Madlib involvement.

Satan Is Real / Handpicked Songs 1955-1962,The Louvin Brothers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d25e6ef959693221b9/1:1/w_160/7541377c.jpeg,2011-11-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15972-satan-is-real-handpicked-songs-1955-1962/,Light in the Attic,"Even if you've never heard a single note from the Louvin Brothers, odds are good that you've at least seen the cover of their 1959 album, Satan Is Real. The discrepancy between that emphatic title and that plywood demon landed it on countless lists of worst or weirdest album covers, usually alongside Paddy Roberts' Songs for Gay Dogs and Orleans' Waking and Dreaming. Charlie and Ira Louvin devised the concept for the artwork themselves and set everything up in an old quarry, cutting Satan from Charlie's son's miniature train table and filling old tires with kerosene to simulate Hell. Then, as if on some Biblical cue, it began to rain, so their poses were hurried and awkward so their white suits wouldn't get drenched. Still, as silly as it may be, there's something curious about that image, especially that folk art figure looming in the background, bucktoothed and cross-eyed. It doesn't look professional or polished, which fits the music: The Louvin Brothers may have been signed to Capitol, but like so many other rural artists who never settled comfortably into either secular or gospel, they still sound both compellingly raw and incredibly sophisticated. Satan Is Real is the duo's best-known record, not only for its cover but for songs like ""The Christian Life"" and ""The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea"", famously covered by the Byrds and Johnny Cash, respectively. Will Ferrell even incorporated the title track into his one-man show, You're Welcome, America: A Final Night with George W. Bush. The album represents a shift from secular to religious music after several years away, and yet the Louvin Brothers weren't necessarily trading one for the other. Like Johnny Cash or even Elvis Presley, they blended popular and church music to amplify the qualities of the other. ""There's a Higher Power"" snaps back and forth in a spirited call and response, but it's the shuffling snare that drive those exultant shouts of ""Amen!"" Similarly, the piano that pushes ""The River of Jordan"" along its freighted path belongs more to the barrelhouse than the revival tent. The Louvin Brothers, despite being brothers and such naturalistic harmonizers, were spiritually and temperamentally mismatched, which may explain the equal emphasis they placed on darkness and light. Charlie adhered strictly to the message of these songs and was likely the guiding force behind Satan Is Real, but Ira was an angry drunk who routinely smashed mandolins on stage and showed up late to concerts. He was shot twice by a wife who claimed he beat her, and he allegedly tried to strangle Presley, whose big beat Ira saw as an affront to country music. Those extremes reflected in their music, at least until Charlie broke up the act and, in a grim irony, Ira was killed by a drunk driver in 1965. Their entire catalog devises a seemingly contradictory mix of the holy and the worldly, the sacred and the profane. How could an act that revels in ""The Christian Life"" turn around and sing a dire murder ballad like ""Knoxville Girl"", whose grisly details still provoke winces even half a century after they sang it? To the Louvins' understanding, man's boundless capacity for sin matched his boundless capacity for salvation, so they weren't simply going to nudge you along the righteous path; they were going to run you off the highway to hell. ""Satan Is Real"" sets the tone and the churchly tableau, as the brothers harmonize on a hymnal chorus before Charlie interrupts with a monologue reminiscent of Hank Williams' Luke the Drifter homilies. ""You can hear him in the songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world,"" he declares of the devil. ""You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart."" It's a scare tactic, yet the brothers' precise vocals and Ira's always agile picking lends the song an urgency and gravity, as though they might be that deeply invested in their listeners' faith. These songs may kill off dear mothers, struggling drunkards, debased sinners, and even innocent little babies, but Satan Is Real somehow conveys jubilation rather than penance, which is likely what inspired 60s country rockers like the Byrds and the Dillards and continues to bear on so many artists today. To that end, Light in the Attic is jointly issuing Handpicked Songs 1955-1962, a compilation of Louvin Brothers songs chosen by musicians representing several generations: Dolly Parton, Chris Hillman, and Kris Kristofferson, as well as Beck, Jim James, and M. Ward, among others. On CD, the sets are packaged together; on vinyl, they're available separately (there's also a vinyl-only reissue of their 1956 LP Tragic Songs of Life). Sonically, vinyl is the better option, but musically, the 2xCD edition provides a better introduction to the Louvin Brothers. Perhaps because it's set so irremovably in the church, Satan Is Real may not be their most accessible album, which means Handpicked Songs makes for a livelier complement than outtakes or live performances and allows for a secular counterpart to the sacred music. It reaches beyond their hits to unearth some deeper catalog cuts like the spry ""Low and Lonely"" (chosen by Jim James) and the loping ""Scared of the Blues"" (chosen by Devendra Banhart), which reveal the scope of their songwriting, the agility of Ira's mandolin playing, and the exuberance of their keening harmonies. Especially for an album produced by committee, Handpicked argues persuasively for the Louvins' relevance long after rock'n'roll supposedly rendered their music obsolete. Even at a time when so many church-bred artists were exploring more worldly markets, the struggle between salvation and damnation has rarely sounded so lively or so gloriously conflicted.","The Louvin Brothers' powerful 1959 album has been reissued, and the CD version comes with a disc of the duo's songs, selected by artists like Devendra Banhart, Beck, and Jim James.

I'm Still in the Night EP,Salem,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b264ea9e61561daa68ff/1:1/w_160/23d60612.jpg,2011-11-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16085-im-still-in-the-night-ep/,IAMSOUND,"Remember these guys? Following Salem's conversation-starting debut album, last year's King Night, they embarked on a headlining U.S. tour; counted Courtney Love and Liv Tyler as celebrity hangers-on/onlookers (respectively); posed for some stylish pictures that revealed band member Heather Marlatt's pregnancy; made a meaningless video for King Night's title track with Jann Wenner's son Theo; offered a horrible Britney Spears remix; and gave a performance at this year's Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona that made their infamous 2010 SXSW appearance sound like Live Rust by comparison. But whatever you think of King Night, the album is still the definitive version of the often imitated sound that Salem brought on the scene. The proper full-length follow-up to King Night is due some time in 2012, and there have been rumors that Salem are pursuing a different direction for the record; the band's latest EP, I'm Still in the Night, carries no indication that they're trying to branch out. True to its title, the four-track EP mostly feels like a collection of songs that didn't make the LP's cut. I'm Still in the Night is more polished in terms of production, from the clipped howls that open the EP to the acid-rain synths of ""Baby Ratta"", and it includes a seven-minute cover of electronic pop collective Alice DeeJay's immortal 1998 trance anthem ""Better Off Alone"". The cover doesn't come close to matching the original (what does?), but there's something perversely appealing about Salem draping a simplistic ""why won't you give your love to me"" anthem in their own dingy, smirking, loner outlook. Mercifully, Salem forgo Jack Donoghue's mush-mouthed rapping until I'm Still in the Night's closing track, ""Krawl"", which finds him rambling about Slurpees, global warming, and how ""your bitch, she could suck a dick for me."" True to form, it's repugnant on any number of levels. So, loud synths, eye-roll-inducing rapping, and more clattering drum machines than you'd find on a footwork compilation-- yes, I'm Still in the Night is more of the same. If you follow along enough to check it out, it offers a predictable mix of what they do well and where they go wrong, but it's also easy to ignore. Which, for a band that thrives on controversy, is a sign of trouble.","This EP companion to last year's King Night finds the witch house OGs offering four new tracks, including a seven-minute cover of Alice Deejay's 1998 trance anthem ""Better Off Alone"".

BasedGod Velli / Silent President,Lil B,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26d13d197565213a783/1:1/w_160/6430e7f6.jpeg,2011-11-29 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16082-lil-b-based-god-vellisilent-president/,self-released,"""I changed the rap game, and a lot of people know that-- a lot of rappers know that,"" says Lil B at the end of BasedGod Velli. The boast comes shortly after he's thrown out a revealing, eyebrow-raising jab: ""I'm the reason you got your deal, bitch, A$AP."" The line, and the fact that it's clearly true, says a lot about Lil B's unique perch in rap: Without ever abandoning the fringe, he's changed the mainstream conversation enough that rappers like A$AP Rocky can score six-figure signings in part by copping B's producers and calling themselves ""pretty"" like he does. But Lil B isn't your standard neglected innovator, grousing in interviews about more successful rappers stealing his style: He's more popular than ever, still constantly retweeting requests from young girls begging him to ""fuck my bitches."" For a cult rapper with no record deal, the extent of his influence is astonishing. BasedGod Velli and The Silent President, both released in the past month, will scan to most onlookers like Just More Lil B Mixtapes. It's an impression he doesn't always exactly work overtime to dismiss: After he ignited an Internet firestorm last summer with his lovely, dazed I'm Gay, he followed it up with I Forgive You, a dare-you-to-get-through-it teeth-gritter that worked like bug spray to anyone who'd just climbed on board. But while they lack the unifying-moment ring of I'm Gay, BasedGod Velli and Silent President are both strong entries into the massive, bewildering Lil B canon. If you sit somewhere in the middle of the Lil B-obsessive spectrum, here's the shorthand: You probably need one or both of these. BasedGod Velli gets the edge over President, for focus and quality of production. The cover, which splits his face with Pac's, Face/Off-style, might get a half-hearted rise out of some rap traditionalists somewhere, but it's difficult by now to imagine many of those types still being undecided about Lil B. He opens the tape up addressing this crowd: ""Niggas talk about 'Lil B done killed rap'/ Stupid bitch, man, I brought the rap game back."" After that, he doesn't waste time defending himself against anyone. The rest of the tape is high-quality #based music, nothing more, nothing less. Lil B is in open-hearted truth-teller mode on Velli: there are no gangsta-rap or pimp-rap exercises. At his best, Lil B uses his positivity like a blunt-force object, clearing out his lane in front of him with the heat of his convictions. Witness this remarkable tirade, also from the title track: ""It ain't hard to smoke weed and go tote gats/ It ain't hard to pimp hos, man you lame for that/ It ain't hard to rob a nigga at close range/ Much harder to go outside and use your brain/ Much harder to go to college and go get grades/ Much harder to get a job to go feed your seed/ Real easy to give up and go complain."" This passage bears all the scuff marks of Lil B's without-a-net style-- it's artless, it's fumbling, the lines barely connect with a rhyming syllable at the end-- but it's a remarkable outpouring nonetheless. ""King Cotton"", which borrows the instrumental from Raekwon and Ghostface's ""Heaven & Hell"", is another highlight, a touching lament framed in the simplest and most direct possible of terms: ""How the fuck can I forget about the people hangin' off a tree/ For the simple fact they look like me?"" Those who write off B's style as mindless rambling could spend a chastening few hours watching other rappers' attempts at ""based"" freestyle: B's gift for turning up startling language inside himself with little to no preparation is uncanny. Silent President is less rewarding and more scattershot than BasedGod Velli. The beat selection and production are lower in quality, and B's real-time fumbling for words occasionally grows outright distracting. But there are some welcome moments: ""Great China Sea"" repurposes the only bit of Watch the Throne's ""Lift Off"" beat worth keeping-- the smooth coda-- and turns it into a parade of softly glowing Christmas lights for B to rap over. On ""The Based One"", he warbles over DJ Khaled/Drake/Rick Ross/Lil Wayne's ""I'm on One"". ""Cap Pillah"" and ""BasedGod 50"" are highly entertaining examples of ignorant Lil B, with gun threats and non-sequiturs thrown out over linoleum-curling beats. As usual, both tapes have moments of sheer irredeemable silliness: On President's ""Beat the Cancer"", he raps over a sped-up loop of Metallica's ""Fade to Black"" and dedicates it to a terminally ill YouTube follower who requested it of him. It's a nice personal gesture but a profoundly ridiculous song (the chorus is ""beat the cancer, cancer."") Ditto for BasedGod Velli's ""I Got AIDS"", which doubles down on Lil B's personal spit-take title sweepstakes and offers a message song so bluntly literal it inspires mostly disbelieving laughs (""on top of that, she gave me herpes when she gave me AIDS!""). What makes them work, though, is their place within the larger Lil B world: His pratfalls are offered up with the same fearless generosity as his triumphs. Without them, we wouldn't feel the audacity of his creative high-wire act. They're the price of entry into Based World, which is still a pretty transformative place to spend some time.","I'm Gay was Lil B's highest profile release to date, and he's kept up his free mixtape pace since. I Forgive You was dire, but this recent pair-- especially BasedGod Velli-- have plenty of inspired moments.

Only by the terms of your original premise, mind you, which promised to be the sort of multimedia, multi-platform, multi-everything project that seemed like a real good idea circa Y2K. The novelty of the core Gorillaz gimmick-- an edgy, anime Banana Splits that gave interviews in character and played high-tech projection live shows in place of their creators, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett-- wore off sometime around the group's third video. But in a surprise upset, Gorillaz have evolved into something more than a cartoon prank or a circus-of-stars side-project, instead becoming the most effective achievement of Albarn's post-Blur career. Though a singles collection in 2011 is as anachronistic as the DVD-ROMs in the early Gorillaz back catalog, this one makes an excellent case for the substance behind the expired high concept of the  ""virtual band."" The decade covered here marked a mercurial time for Albarn, who celebrated the hiatus of Blur by eagerly shooting off in a dozen different directions. It was almost as though he set out to tick off every clichéd solo career path simultaneously: jamming melodica with musicians in Mali and the Congo, creating a remixer persona, putting together his fantasy-dub supergroup the Good, the Bad & the Queen, and exploring opera and film scoring. Gorillaz is far and away the most successful of these projects at the cash register, selling millions of records worldwide, headlining Glastonbury and Coachella, and holographically sharing a Grammys stage with Madonna. The group's artistic success has also kept pace with its commercial success, giving Albarn a way to combine most of his musical distractions into an oddly cohesive whole. In retrospect, the key to the project may have been enabling Albarn to abandon the frontman role and become the man behind the curtain, both figuratively and (up until recent live shows) literally. If you don't think that hiding place isn't therapeutic for Albarn, consider that Think Tank, the 2003 Blur album that essentially became an Albarn solo joint, also attempted to blend all of these interests, to less satisfying results. Taking the greatest-hits route through Gorillaz's career, it's impressive how few of the tracks sound dated. Genre-free zones were all the rage in 2001, with many groups aiming for futuristic blends of hip-hop, electronic, pop, and rock that sounded past their sell-by within a year. But apart from the Deltron 3030 sequel of ""Rock the House"" and the tacky remixes filling out this collection's runtime, even the earliest Gorillaz singles have avoided the erosion to retro. Credit an inspirational assist to Hewlett: His music-cliché characters may not have been able to sustain a satire or a storyline, but his trademark post-apocalyptic techno-dread was a suitable environmental muse for the urban Morricone that became the Gorillaz formula. And a surprisingly flexible formula it turned out to be, able to assimilate guest appearances as varied as the artisan-rap of De La Soul, the garble of Shaun Ryder, and the elder croon of Bobby Womack. Off the mic, Albarn found fruitful collaborations with producers-du-jour Dan the Automator and Danger Mouse, borrowing ideas without contaminating the project's core aesthetic. Behind the protective screen of his invited guests, Albarn used Gorillaz to find a new voice both as a songwriter and a vocalist. There's an unbroken evolutionary line connecting ""Tomorrow Comes Today"" to ""On Melancholy Hill"", and it's got an upward slope-- the latter is a moody-pop masterpiece that would sound completely foreign on any Blur LP.  The strictly singles format makes this collection an unbalanced summary, with arguably the weakest LP (2005's Demon Days) given the largest representation. But in its synthesis of Albarn's post-Blur interests, it's a fairly accurate snapshot of a busy decade for the singer, where he ironically found mid-life maturity inside a cartoon world.","This collection of singles spanning the project's entire run shows how Gorillaz evolved into something more than a cartoon prank, instead becoming the most effective achievement of Damon Albarn's post-Blur career.

Keep Your Dreams,Canyons,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b256ea9e61561daa68e3/1:1/w_160/edcbdc7a.jpeg,2011-11-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16065-keep-your-dreams/,Modular,"Bad timing that Canyons released Keep Your Dreams in the same year M83 and Cut Copy finally put out new albums. I've already read several naysayers make comparisons to both of those acts, in order to dismiss Canyons out of hand, but the connection strikes me as both obvious and inexact. True, Canyons have got a taste for the brittle and buzzing tones of early synthesizer music, just like Anthony Gonzalez and crew. And Canyons are interested in creating heart-stirring epics out bits of 1980s pop culture previously deemed off-limits because they were just too damn kitschy, same as M83 and the Cut Copy boys. But while Hurry Up, We're Dreaming and Zonoscope can sometimes bludgeon you with their need to be monumental, Keep Your Dreams follows a far more idiosyncratic path into much stranger and less immediately arena-pleasing places. For one thing, there's far more weirdo disco boogie, and early ambient house ala the Orb, and Toto-style sensitive dude rock in Canyons' sound. All those wobbly saxophone solos, for one thing. And the stoned hand percussion and jungle bird sound effects. The best tracks here aren't so much sweeping shoegaze/new wave classics-in-the-making as bedroom producer dance jams that keep sprouting all sorts of weird-pop moments as the beats roll on. When they're really on, Canyons are maximalists who seem pained to follow one idea to its conclusion when they can keep things mutating, unrepentant oddballs who still love a good earworm but would prefer to have three. Plus they thankfully have little truck with revisionist notions of good taste when it comes 80s dance music, which was often pretty great because it was so gauche. ""Under a Blue Sky"" is so unashamedly campy and overloaded with winning ""bad"" ideas retrieved from the dustbin of dance music history that it makes the DFA's rehabilitative aims sound downright acetic. Slap bass that's so clean and stiff it feels more robotic than fluidly funky? Check. A campy ""menacing"" vocalist, pitched-down Adonis-style, spouting suggestive French gibberish? Got it. Gritless ""funk"" guitar that makes Power Station sound like Muddy Waters? Yup. An elephant's trumpet call for the hell of it? Sure, why not. Canyons remix and get remixed by ""acceptably"" serious dance dons like DJ Harvey, but the high points of Keep Your Dreams revel in the unacceptable baubles of what was once mainstream pop. They remember that so much of 80s dance-pop blurred the line between novelty music and alien-sounding futurism. Even when they try to play things straight, toying with more hipster-approved genres, Canyons can't seem to help stretching out the weirdness in the forms they're playing with. ""See Blind Through"" is classic late-80s Chicago house, right down to the purposefully crude vocal cut-ups and the Mr. Fingers bassline. Except the whole thing's been DJ Screwed, a tempo changes that amplifies the darkness of the original sound. It becomes a woozy black hole of faux soul, not too far off from the similarly molasses-ized grooves you'd find on Rub N Tug mixtapes a few years back. And then the vocals evoke not only a drag show diva but a zonked-out Michael McDonald wandering through a warehouse party. It shouldn't work but does. It's just warped enough from its source materials to avoid bland pastiche, but not crassly out-there, weird for the sake of it. Canyons clearly love the stuff they draw from, enough to not merely want to ape it, and they know genre shouldn't be fucked with just to be ""interesting."" ""My Rescue"" could have been a pleasant enough indie rock song, stirring in a generic sort of way, but the deep house piano and percussion give it just enough of an edge, the two distinct genres harmonizing into sound more indie bands should make use of. What keeps the prize moments of Keep Your Dreams from feeling obnoxiously ""eclectic"" is the smoothness of the production and the arrangements. The tracks may be over-stuffed with ideas, but Canyons have also studied the way 80s producers could make ""big"" tracks where every idea rang out clear, where all the little touches felt integrated into something bigger than the sum of a lot of cute parts. But unfortunately that the zigzagging dance-collage stuff only accounts for little more than half of Keep Your Dreams' running time, and on the rest of the album, Canyons' interest in smoothness drags them down. The least convincing side of Canyons is the soft-rock stuff, and there's a lot of it here, especially in the record's back-end. Maybe it feels flat and less creative than Canyons' dance tunes simply because there's been so much laid-back yacht gunk over the last half-decade. Or maybe it's because Canyons don't seem to devote half as much creative energy to this side of their output. The deckside reveries on Keep Your Dreams really are played too straight, and hardly convincing, even as homage, when A/B'd with the stuff you can still hear for free every day on classic rock radio. A whole album of disorienting patchwork grooves like ""Under a Blue Sky"" might have eventually worn the casual listener down. But Canyons also want to be songwriters, and though they draw on different inspirations, it's here that they fall short compared to M83 and Cut Copy. Forget Lindsey Buckingham, or hell, even Mark Knopfler. But when they go for manic instead of mellow, Canyons do bring something new, even if it's just intensity, to the 80s retro party.","The Australian duo Canyons get compared to M83 and Cut Copy, but their debut LP follows a far more idiosyncratic path into much stranger and less immediately arena-pleasing places.

No Kings,Doomtree,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b236b1335d7bf169a3d6/1:1/w_160/4ded0ba4.jpeg,2011-11-28 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16043-doomtree-no-kings/,Doomtree,"Minneapolis' Doomtree let a bunch of their hydra heads have a turn in the spotlight over the last year or so, and the ensuing solo releases were a solid indicator of just how multifaceted a crew they could be. But of all the records that had the potential to raise the collective's profile-- including rapper/singer Dessa's coolly strong Castor, the Twin, Sims' feral, heavy-hitting Bad Time Zoo, Lazerbeak's indie pop-friendly Legend Recognize Legend, and Paper Tiger's intricately soulful beat record Made Like Us-- it was, of all things, a mash-up record that blew up. Funny thing is, the concept behind the Cecil Otter co-created ""Wugazi"" project wasn't just some blog-baiting crossover stunt-- it's a way to look at where Doomtree got their early inspiration as an entity, somewhere between the form-like-Voltron Wu-Tang enclave's early underground mythbuilding and Fugazi's community-building independence. But the easy-sell concept of Shaolin punk doesn't even really come into obvious play with No Kings. The hardcore continuum isn't as readily acknowledged as it was on P.O.S.'s solo work, while Lazerbeak's Plastic Constellations background doesn't figure in his productions much, either. (The most traditionally and superficially ""punk rock"" sound on the album is the surfer-hoodlum riff that opener ""No Way"" builds around, and that's sourced from an early 1970s soundtrack-library album.) And not even Ghostface in full-blown manic stream-of-imagery Supreme Clientele mode was as relentlessly evasive and tricky to parse as some of the verses on here. Loosely alluded-to themes about camaraderie and identity get buried under waves of abstract allusions that leave behind little narrative impact on first listen, other than the vague sense of some victorious resilience. Fortunately, that vague sense has some intrigue beneath it. Sims, Cecil Otter, Mike Mictlan, P.O.S., and Dessa all share a beat-poet sense of tightly-packed extended abstract metaphors, which they vary to subtle enough degrees that differentiating their voices seems beside the point. That's not to their detriment, and the aforementioned solo releases are proof enough that they can each go in their own distinct directions. But as a unit, they complement each others' talents naturally, each providing their own variations on allegorical stress-rap. ""Team the Best Team"" might be the best example of how all five MCs switch up their approaches-- P.O.S. as sincerely intense slow-burner, Sims's slick-flowing, machete-sharp delivery, Cecil Otter throwing pinpoint darts with deadpan calm, Dessa's deceptively cool-headed, subtly melodic shadowboxing, and Mike Mictlan's agitated yet precise internal-rhyming intensity. Those qualities are easier to pick up on when they shake you away from the duty of parsing their lyrics, which, unbound by typical battle-rap punchlines or persona-building, at least manage to sell their cryptic insights as rallying calls. The dense weight of verbiage on No Kings actually welcomes uninitiated listeners, rather than siphoning them out for not being advanced enough on some impenetrable ultra-battler shit. And for the scattered talk of 10-year tenures and the occasional fuck-these-other-rappers declaration, the album's tone of flag-planting resistance builds off something deeper and more universal than political beef, star status or personal style. The trespassing-as-liberation undercurrents of ""Bolt Cutter"", the solidarity anthem ""Bangarang"" and the self-realized, apocalypse-flip-off ""Own Yours"" are all introspective in their own ways, but they're too busy staring you dead in the eye to gaze at their own navels. And it's easy enough to give the lyrics plenty of time and space to sink in-- or even just roll off your back for the time being-- when the beats are this up-front and anthemic. With a production that largely draws off the strengths of their two primary beatmakers, the individuals' highlights-- Lazerbeak's grimy, garage-psych-infused ""String Theory"" and ""Punch-Out""; the Super NES prog of Cecil Otter's beats for ""Beacon"" and ""The Grand Experiment""-- are as much a collective triumph as the group efforts, like the co-produced bookends of motorcycle chain-swinging mini-suite ""No Way"" and the digital brass blowout of ""Fresh New Trash"". Doomtree have been comfortable inside their own space for so long that their individualistic pride in it has grown from defiant to triumphant. That one-off bootleg drew all the attention-- No Kings damn well better keep it.","This year's ""Wugazi"" mashup album raised Doomtree's profile. On the Minneapolis hip-hop collective's first proper LP since 2008, the five MCs each provide their own subtle variations on allegorical stress-rap.

Dive,Tycho,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25f13d197565213a76e/1:1/w_160/5d4d2528.jpeg,2011-11-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16071-dive/,Ghostly,"Scott Hansen, aka Tycho, is a fairly well-known graphic artist, and you can hear his design skills at play in his music. Like a particularly crisp logo or font, his songs have a good sense of scale and proportion, and it's clear that a lot of work goes into them. Take a look at his artwork and you'll have a good idea of what his electronic compositions sound like, too. Nostalgic, 1970s-inspired imagery, a heavy sense of tranquility and faraway longing, all tied together with a pretty sleek modernity. Several of these elements have been sort of beaten into the ground in indie music over the past few years, but with Dive, Hansen manages to pull them together in a way that still feels compelling. Tycho's tracks are built primarily with synths and sampled live instrumentation, and his electro-organic approach brings to mind leaders in this field like Boards of Canada and Bibio. Sonically, too, he explores terrain similar to those guys': ""A Walk"" and ""Coastal Break"" nail a pastoral peacefulness with warm, sepia-toned beats and flourishes of acoustic guitar. What separates Tycho, at least from a lot of the bedroom-oriented artists currently exploring similar sounds, is simple craft. These tracks are OCD-level meticulous. Hear it in the percussion: In place of the tinny, synthetic beats favored by lots of indie-ambient startups, Hansen takes extra care to capture real live drum sounds with a crack and thump that makes you feel like you're in the room with them. His attention to detail goes beyond highlighting individual instruments. It's there in the way Hansen simply builds a song, merging all the synth wooshes and percussive ripples to find a natural arc. ""Daydream"", for example, starts out fairly simple with twinkly guitars and a sturdy, knocking beat, but the song's pulse quickens as it progresses, and by the end you've got something heady enough to live up to its title. Because Hansen clearly wants this to be a deep headphone experience, those subtle shifts go a long way in holding your interest. And in terms of the imagery he builds-- fields, pastures, calming oceanic scenes-- it's all there, and it's pretty easy to set your brain on ""relax"" and conjure up those natural landscapes. If that nicely detailed tranquility is Dive's biggest selling point, it also exposes a nagging flaw, which is a lack of tension. Hansen is so committed to keeping things serene that he doesn't incorporate much danger or risk, and at times the album can feel a bit one-note. An out-of-nowhere tonal change or an occasional tinge of darkness would give the record more balance, make it more interesting. That missing element of surprise keeps Tycho from reaching the same heights as BoC or Bibio (the former more otherworldly, the latter more adventurously poppy), but ultimately Hansen succeeds at what he sets out to do. Dive might not be the most ambitious instrumental record you hear all year, but it almost always sounds good.","Electronic producer Scott Hansen builds a subtle album heavy on warm synths and serene beauty that at its best evokes the work of Boards of Canada and Bibio.

Dreama EP,Kingdom,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b262ea9e61561daa68f9/1:1/w_160/e2d971ac.jpeg,2011-11-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16073-kingdom-dreama-ep/,Night Slugs,"Last year's EP That Mystic was a good introduction to Kingdom, the Brooklyn producer and Night Slugs/Fool's Gold stablemate who operates in a distinct idiom you could call ""BK funky."" At its core, the EP fused the intricacy of post-dubstep with the production sensibility and anything-goes nature of contemporary pop. And his everything-is-percussion approach built up a sense of bustling hugeness that, speaker-rattling immediacy notwithstanding, never overwhelmed its Swiss-watch rhythmic engineering. That it did so in an intense, almost panicky sort of way was part of the appeal-- the tweaky gallop of the title track's kick-heavy rhythm was one of bass music's best last year-- but it also left a lot of options for new directions to go in the still relatively early stages of an ambitious and wide-ranging style. Dreama plays with a few of those options, maintaining the balance between keeping his big ideas both upfront and subtly beneath the surface. The songs on this EP are largely less concerned with jostling listeners into its rhythmic space and more prone to luring them in instead, though once they get inside they can still get thrown around a bit. The organized clamor and high tension still jumps out here and there, most notably in ""Stalker Ha"": Its snares are crisp to the point of brittle, it teases out a water-drip piano note just long enough to make it a neat shock when the melody turns into a Halloween homage, and it builds a sharp sense of anxiety out of the way it layers half-ecstatic/half-haunted wordless soul vocals over an insistently ringing old telephone bell. It's brisk stuff, an easy highlight of a repertoire still on the upswing. But defining Kingdom by the standards of all that taut chaos his earlier work laid down doesn't fit quite as easily with the rest of the EP. Take the title track, a cut that opens with a loping stride of a beat-- a heavy skulk ready to break out into a Rickey Henderson sprint. If you dork out for drum patterns, it's a headspinning juxtaposition of kicks, snares, claps, and snaps that's striking enough on its own. But it's not put in service of deep-pressure dynamics and a mood steeped in turmoil-- it's more like straight-up funk, with an alternately pitched-up-and-down vocal ""ayyy"" careening off fat synths that simultaneously evoke classic boogie and current Dirty South-indebted R&B. It's wide open and airy to the point of almost being calming, but it still thumps. ""Hood by Air Theme"" is a bit more tense, with foreboding atmospherics, teased-out vocal snippets, swelling bass, and floodgate-bursting percussion buildups rolled out as a blatant prelude to a big drop. But the drop itself is what makes it, and it's so audaciously deployed and timed-- and recognizably iconic in just how joyous it is-- that it'd almost feel like a spoiler just mentioning where it comes from. (It also proves that in the right hands, there's no such thing as a too-obvious sample.) Maybe the best summary of what Kingdom's capable of can be found in the opening track. ""Let You No"" incorporates a comparatively lesser-known R&B track, Sadie Ama's ""Fallin"", to similar dramatic effect as ""Hood by Air Theme"". But it's a more slippery build, capitalizing on sneaking early hints of her voice under cover of the track's whistle-squeak synth and some characteristically skittery beats. We hear her first as faint echoes, then chopped up percussively, then finally breaking through as a full-fledged hook that almost reads, in this new context, like a statement on breaking tension: ""I should've held back/ But I just thought I'd let you know."" For all his polyrhythmic complexity and string-pulling, emotional mood-setting, Kingdom knows his way around a voice-- and that's where he's got his future down on lock. Maybe pop's future, too.","The Brooklyn producer and Night Slugs/Fool's Gold stablemate's appealing new EP is less concerned with jostling listeners into its rhythmic space than last year's That Mystic.

Gish [Deluxe Edition] / Siamese Dream [Deluxe Edition],The Smashing Pumpkins,by: Ned Raggett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b249b1335d7bf169a3ec/1:1/w_160/ce32334f.jpg,2011-11-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/,EMI,"I remember reading a desert-island-albums list by Billy Corgan in 1993 that was so scarily like my own musical arc-- pop/prog/metal nerd discovers goth, Jane's Addiction, and My Bloody Valentine-- that I couldn't have been more designed for Smashing Pumpkins hyperfandom if I tried. Like no one before him, Corgan made those influences work. As Canadian writer Jennifer Nine once put it in Melody Maker, you got a sense that he was the kind of guy who worked out every last transcription from Guitar Player in the 1980s and then actually did something with it. It helped that the rest of the band had their own skills, especially in the case of Jimmy Chamberlin, a jazz/hard-rock drum freak let loose on alt-rock radio. Alt-rock radio, at its height of commercial trendsetting, enabled the Pumpkins to not merely survive but thrive. There, Corgan could have his cake and eat it too, daring people to get annoyed at his starlust and reacting in kind while further building up his ambitions. He got his band signed to a major label and used the fig leaf of a corporate indie release for Gish, scored a prime spot on the Seattle-focused Singles soundtrack with ""Drown"", essentially went ""Haters gonna hate"" with Siamese Dream's first single ""Cherub Rock"", and got petulant when any other acts or writers accused him of protesting too much. And not just Pavement, either: ""You hurt me deeply in my heart,"" he once infamously pouted to Kim Thayil before a 1994 Australian concert, following which the Pumpkins went on ""to play the best set anybody has ever heard them play."" All of which goes some distance toward explaining why both reissues of Gish and Siamese Dream-- appropriately loaded with rarities, DVD bonuses, fancy packaging, and often-impressionistic song-for-song liner notes by Corgan-- remain remarkable though unequal listens. Even in 1991, Gish felt like something that started off well with songs like ""Siva"" and ""Rhinoceros"" but meandered a bit toward the end. Corgan's voice never sounded as lost in his music as it does here, and most of the emphasis is on the band's collective performance: Chamberlin's powerful, fluid drumming, Darcy Wretzky's strong basslines, and that thick, chunky glaze of guitars. The rarities disc contains a few never-before-heard numbers, a few that have long circulated among fanatics (the Corgan-sung version of ""Daydream"" is a keeper), and a handful of remixed selections (including their best full-on rock epic, ""Starla"") that first surfaced on a full-length release via the odds-and-ends release Pisces Iscariot. These tracks do a better job of showcasing the band's various sonic sides than Gish itself. The DVD, a multi-camera cut from a live show at the Metro in Chicago almost a year prior to Gish's release, shows that the band already had their exact arrangements pretty well down, as well as a worshipping fanbase. The highlights include Corgan and James Iha's heavily long hair, curious fashion choices all around, and set-closing covers of Steppenwolf and Blue Öyster Cult; the video quality is pretty good and the sound mix, if heavily favoring the vocals, beats out most bootlegs of the time. In contrast to Gish's steady flow, Siamese Dream crashes out of the gate. ""Cherub Rock"" remains an absolutely stellar opener with a sense of pure sonic melodrama, thanks to Chamberlin's circus-act drum introduction, a tight clip of guitars quickly matched by equally nimble bass, a volcanic blast of a guitar lead, and then a shift to a woozy, still-building sprawl. And all this before the first verse even starts. Throw in everything that followed-- the overt MBV worship of ""Hummer"", the country-rock-tinged wanderlust of ""Mayonaise"", ""Soma""'s update of Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones"" for a new decade, and inevitably the MTV/radio hits ""Today"", ""Disarm"", and ""Rocket""-- and no matter your take on its mastermind or his divisive whining/sighing vocals, it's an embarrassment of musical riches. There's also the fact that the album's studio personnel was as essentially stripped down as the White Stripes; Corgan, frantically taking charge in the midst of band dysfunction, recorded nearly everything himself aside from the drums, and he'd probably have handled those too if he could. Siamese Dream's songs don't blend into each other, but some transitions exist; each stands out in a brilliant sequence, forming perhaps the best concept album they ever made. One of the main things people complained about was exactly what made the band click even further. If Corgan's early lyrics were classic self-centered/self-righteous/self-pitying teenagerdom run amock, he always had an ear for hooks, metaphors, and deft summaries (thus, on ""Mayonaise"": ""Fool enough to almost be it/ Cool enough to not quite see it""). It's catnip for when you have it bad, no matter how minuscule your problems might really be, and any number of later bands (My Chemical Romance most obviously, and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart most recently) took plenty of notice. As for the many rarities, more Pisces Iscariot remixes and other demos and alternate versions take a bow, including a six-minute version of ""Siamese Dream"" itself (the original B-side version was a shorter and murkier take that ran under three minutes) and twin instrumentals ""U.S.A."" and ""U.S.S.R."". The DVD is the most worthwhile addition of either reissue; taken from another Metro show a couple of weeks after Siamese Dream's release, it vividly illustrates how far the band had come in the three years since Gish: It showcases their more varied sound, Corgan's keener sense for playing to the crowd (there are flashes of his and Iha's underrated sense of humor), a killer setlist drawing on both albums (plus ""Starla"" and ""Drown""), and brilliant sound and performances throughout. If Corgan's voice shows strain at many points, the crowd shots are especially entertaining, with endless moshpits and crowdsurfers during most of the loud points and plenty of the slow ones. The full story of the band's existence has plenty of ups and downs to go through, and there are more reissues to come to spell this out, even as the current version of the band moves along according to Corgan's own cryptic impulses. Yet these two releases still resonate, as both a nostalgia fix underscoring how it was so easy to fall for Smashing Pumpkins in the first place, and as the best introductions to their music any newcomer could want.","It's sometimes easy to forget why Billy Corgan is famous, but these reissues of Smashing Pumpkins' first two albums underscore what made them so vital at the dawn of the 90s and why their influence is still felt today.

Welcome to Condale,Summer Camp,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25b5e6ef959693222a0/1:1/w_160/e079d93a.jpeg,2011-11-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16069-welcome-to-condale/,Moshi MoshiApricot Records,"Condale, the California town that's the focal point of UK indie pop duo Summer Camp's debut LP, Welcome to Condale, doesn't actually exist. It was invented by SC members Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley; to drive the whole conceptual thing home, the band's created a zine pressed in limited physical quantities and available to view on their website (hint: click on ""Condale""); along with narrative-extending diary entries and fake interviews with faker bands, there's the cover to a 1977 issue of Penthouse, a poster for the obscure 1974 skin flick Teenage Milkmaid, and the cover of the February 27, 1984 issue of Jet, which features an image of Brooke Shields and Michael Jackson together. On the upper right corner of the band's website, there's a by-the-minute update on the current date and time-- with two small alterations: the year is listed as 1984, and it's specified that no matter where you are, you're living under ""Condale Time"" for the moment. Obviously, Warmsley and Sankey went to great lengths to create this world, and in a way it's impressive, but the non-musical aspects of Welcome to Condale (especially the ""zine"" portion, which eschews the personal-cultural DIY nature of the form in favor of signifier-collecting scrapbook nostalgia) highlights the pair's predilection for time-distanced cultural references. Anyone who listened to last year's Young EP could have seen this coming, as Sankey sang about ""A boy dressed like Teen Wolf"" and friends taking photos ""with Polaroid cameras"" on a song titled after Winona Ryder's character in Heathers. Still, their (sometimes ironic, sometimes not) devotion to the past is persistent, especially in the face of the growing realization that such devotion in indie culture is exhausting itself: in the video for Welcome to Condale single ""Better Off Without You"", Sankey sings her punchy part under an Instagram'd filter, juxtaposed by vintage-looking footage of teen-focused films. Warmsley is seen playing some guitar, wearing a ""wolf shirt"" (something he's known to wear, it seems). As some people tend to forget, indie pop's relationship with the past is part of the genre's lifeblood, with bands using out-of-time images and cultural figures to create their own little universes, away from the pain of modern life. Summer Camp, on the other hand, collect such influences like Pogs (a bit of cultural ephemera untouched by these two, thus far at least) and merely throw 'em out here and there, without context or relation to the music. Witness the ill-juxtaposed vocal samples that open the lost-youth lament ""Summer Camp"", a far cry from the Tough Alliance's personal-is-political use of a key line from John Cassavetes' Shadows on ""A New Chance"", or the fact that the album's swaggering bedroom-arena highlight, ""Brian Krakow"", takes its name from the nerdy character on ""My So-Called Life"". The song's a bit of a brilliant kiss-off-but-not-really anthem, featuring a rare lead vocal turn from Warmsley that, truth be told, carries more bold confidence than the actual (fictional) Krakow could have ever possessed. An entire album of ""Brian Krakow""s, or the winding, ecstatic pop of ""Better Off Without You"", would make all of Summer Camp's nostalgic wrongs somewhat right. Unfortunately, Welcome to Condale is stylistically all over the place and, despite its generally upbeat tone, kind of a drag to listen to (the fact that those two aforementioned tracks kick off the album highlights how front-loaded the thing is). Instead, we get some more sparkly pop (""1988""), chugging indie rock (""Down""), sluggish electro murk (""I Want You"", ""Nobody Knows You""), and a re-recorded version of Young's ""Ghost Train"" that, while improving on the original, shows how little they've grown as a band between then and now. As producer, Pulp's Steve Mackey does a decent job of figuring out what kind of retro-tastic sheen this type of music warrants (hint: kind of like this, or this), but its application seems tacky and forced, especially since the source material isn't very engaging to begin with. ""Everything changes when you grow old."" That's the first thing you see when you visit Summer Camp's website, as a line is slowly drawn through the phrase, negating its inevitable truth. The truth, obviously, is things do change as you get older, as they should and as Warmsley should know quite well; prior to starting Summer Camp with Sankey, he released two solo albums of cut-and-paste electro-acoustic pop (2006's The Art of Fiction and 2008's How We Became) that bear little resemblance to the music he's making now. Of course, plenty of musicians change the sounds they're working in all the time, even if Warmsley's recent move toward this particular brand of in-vogue, backward navel-gazing is suspicious in its possible calculation. The fact, however, that he was easily able to make the transfer from a front-and-center singer/songwriter to a competent sideman to Sankey's vocal talents highlights how little actual personality and originality Summer Camp possess as a project. Settling in and safely blending into the background: I guess this is growing up.","Summer Camp's debut LP, produced by Pulp's Steve Mackey, highlights the UK indie pop duo's predilection for time-distanced cultural references as well as its lack of personality.

Wild One,North Highlands,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b250c0084474cd0c1f5b/1:1/w_160/081f2e1e.jpeg,2011-11-23 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16061-wild-one/,self-released,"Some people travel far from their hometown in order to get away from it, others end up needing a few reminders of where they're from. Singer Brenda Malvini appears to fall into the latter category; after growing up in North Highlands in Sacramento, California, she moved to New York to attend NYU, ultimately naming her band after the place where she was raised. If North Highlands find fame, at least she can never be accused of forgetting where she came from. Wild One is the band's debut full-length, constructed by Malvini and her band, which demonstrates a proficiency seldom heard on the Brooklyn indie rock circuit. Fortunately, this is a group that knows how to juggle the technical gifts at its disposal and the emotional application needed to make this something more than an exercise in indie navel-gazing. Wild One might seem like an inappropriate banner to hoist over such quotidian surface structures, but dig a little deeper and it clearly represents this band's desire to shake things up every once in a while. Like any new group still etching out an identity, it's not hard to pluck out precedents to the North Highlands sound as this record progresses. In particular, the recently revived Electrelane circa No Shouts, No Calls are a strong reference point, with Malvini's singing mirroring Verity Susman's vocal lines on occasion (""Steady Steady,"" ""Roundhouse""). The band members are fond of taking her work and interlacing it with jerky rhythms that are clamped to the kind of ultra-bright guitar playing Vampire Weekend practice, ultimately settling into a style that's one part ice-cold detachment and one part fizzy pop encompassment. The juxtaposition is good for creating a space for North Highlands to operate within, where the aloof vocal on a song like ""Chicago"" keeps their audience at arm's length, only for some Tindersticks-y string arrangements to pull them back in with their warmth and vitality. Those strings add a touch of drama to Wild One whenever they surface. ""Lion Heart"" is a moving piece or orchestral pop that errs close to the kind of drunken flamboyance that Marc Almond or Patrick Wolf are fond of staggering around in, conjuring up a feeling North Highlands would be wise to return to more often than they do here. Much of this record remains solidly grounded in indie rock, with the band members occasionally scattering trails of potential paths they could follow behind them. When they keep it simple, with a guitar jangle and a driving beat (""Bruce"") or by taking the pace down a little (""Best Part"") it works simply as a showcase for Malvini's striking voice. She tends to shy away from revealing too much about herself, falling into a group of similarly minded female singers that includes Broadcast's Trish Keenan and Laetitia Sadier from Stereolab, where the not-knowing leaves a series of questions simply hanging in the air. That sense of mystery is North Highlands' biggest asset, especially as they can always anchor it in a sound that's flexible enough to allow them to experiment and work up characteristics that are identifiably their own. The next step should be to shore up that sound, in a similar manner to Broadcast's leap from The Noise Made by People to Haha Sound. Sometimes Wild One wears its influences a little too hard on its sleeve, or strives too hard to create something anthemic with across-the-board appeal-- the closing ""Here's"" fulfills both of those criteria. That song has a tension that feels ill-fitting, because when North Highlands relax into their looser material, this stuff just seems to pour out of them, delivering an elegance that suggests they could shake off their tendency to emulate artists to whom they're so obviously in thrall.","Brenda Malvini named her band after her hometown of North Highlands, California. On this debut LP, the mystery in her striking voice is the Brooklyn-based group's biggest asset.

"Boddie Recording Company: Cleveland, Ohio",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24013d197565213a73a/1:1/w_160/3a153f57.jpeg,2011-11-23 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16050-boddie-recording-company-cleveland-ohio/,Numero Group,"Do a quick Google search for 12202 Union Avenue, Cleveland, OH. The top result is a Google map that still shows a Boddie Recording label at the address. Switch to Street View, and there's an attractive red two-story house with yellow trim and a sign out front that says ""Boddie,"" with eighth notes standing in for the Ds. Down the driveway, a garage is visible, but it's not an ordinary garage. It's the remains of Boddie Recording Company, the long-lived but never well-known recording concern of Thomas and Louise Boddie. The outbuildings behind the house still contain the ephemera of record labels that long ago faded to silence, a studio that hosted its last session decades ago, and a pressing plant that has sat idle since the mid-1980s, some of the components of the pressing line long since sold off. In this space, a few hundred 45s and LPs were prepared for a world that never bothered to hear them. Though this release doesn't strictly fall under the banner of Numero Group's long-running soul archeology project Eccentric Soul, it fits with the spirit of the project, unearthing not just the music made at Boddie but also the history and personalities surrounding it-- the old, grainy photographs and detailed histories contained in the two liner-note booklets place the music on these three CDs in the context of the people that made it and the place where it was made. Boddie Recording Company was born out of Thomas Boddie's passion for electronics, a passion he acquired when very young. He built his own radios and speaker systems in junior high, went to tech school (the only black student in his class), served in the Army Air Force during World War II. He got himself a job repairing organs after his discharge and apprenticed at a local Cleveland studio while amassing a collection of studio gear in the basement of the house he shared with his brother. Boddie's fledgling company cut its first sides in 1959, the same year Berry Gordy founded Motown on the other side of Lake Erie, but the two companies' arcs could not have been more different. Where Gordy assembled a brilliant core of creative people who built long-lasting working relationships and devised processes of production and quality control that turned his company into a powerhouse, Boddie and his wife worked day and night with very limited resources to build a studio behind their new house that wasn't ready for business until 1964. Even then, there was no team. Boddie recorded local acts but had no house band. The company established several imprints on which to release recordings but had no real avenues through which to promote them. The first disc of this set focuses on the Soul Kitchen and related Cookin' labels, which were active primarily in the early 1970s. The music on these releases falls mostly in the psychedelic soul realm-- during the same period, one of Cleveland's most admired bands was the Purple Image, a funky psychedelic outfit that recorded a classic self-titled LP in 1970. The Creations Unlimited and the Inter-Circle each cut strong fuzz funk singles, Ricky Hodges' ""I Feel It (The Love You Have For Me)"" features fantastically ragged guitar taking bites out of an elastic beat while flute flutters around his soul shouting, and ""Soul Feeling"" finds Frankie Pighee & the Soulettes making their own outstanding contribution to the long lineage of soul roll-call tunes. None of it is especially polished, and it's hard to pinpoint the potential hits that never were, because there were so many records like this being made at the time; but there is a certain optimism and spirit of hard work in these recordings that makes them an exciting body of work to listen to all at once. The same can be said of the earlier recordings on disc two, which were mostly released on the Luau label. There are some great band names-- the Atomic Aces and the Modern Detergents definitely top the list-- and a lot of rollicking R&B on the disc, which works with disc one to paint a picture of the evolving soul scene in Cleveland during the era. There was a lot of talent toiling down there in the dead-end clubs, and Boddie captured a good cross-section of it. While these recordings are fun and sometimes even great, they didn't exactly provide the seeds for any money trees, and Thomas Boddie continued to repair organs and radios on the side. He slowly pieced together his own pressing plant, he recorded a lot of out-of-town bluegrass and folk groups touring through Cleveland, he built his own mobile recording unit, he ran a side company called Boddie Audio Advertising (it was a car with a PA on top-- they used it to support Carl Stokes' campaign for mayor), and he also tapped in to one of the safer-- if not more profitable-- markets in music: gospel. The final disc of the set is filled with gospel recordings from Boddie's Bounty imprint, spanning from 1967 all the way to 1983, the very twilight of Boddie as a recording concern. Bits of gospel do crop up on the other discs (the King James Version's two tracks on disc one are especially entertaining), but disc three is a clinic in the numerous ways that singers and bands found to put their faith into music. Some of it is ham-handed and overwrought-- Rev. R.L. Hubbard's operatics on ""Child of the King"" do not complement the spooky soul backing, and the screechy kid vocals of the Wings of Faith Juniors of Grand Rapids, Michigan, are rough sledding-- but a lot of it is clever and enjoyable on its own musical terms. Brother Bill wasn't the only one to wrap religion in a faux-countercultural rap, but he does it with a lot of panache, and Silver King's ""Trouble in the Water"" psychedelicizes a variation on the old ""Wade in the Water"" themes. A couple of songs engage in some rather un-Christian theft. Sound of Soul's ""Gospel Train"" is actually the Impressions' ""People Get Ready"" lazily retitled, and the Gospel Ensemble's ""What You Need"" liberally borrows from the Isley Brothers' ""It's Your Thing"", to name two examples that give soul fans an opportunity to play detective. Some of the later gospel sides were recorded not at Boddie's studio but in the actual churches, using his mobile unit. As his vinyl pressing operation, never big enough to be a hugely profitable concern, struggled in the early 1980s in the face of collapsing demand, Thomas Boddie got into cassette duplication. He'd often make a recording at a service that would then be duplicated and sold to congregants. Boddie never shuttered his company. He died in 2006, but he hadn't ever considered putting Boddie Recording Company to bed permanently. Instead, it faded quietly away, years of incredibly hard work and long hours settling silently under layers of dust in the buildings behind his house. Boddie is a footnote to Cleveland's musical history, more or less, but as the city's premier low-cost studio, he provided a huge service to the city's music scene for over 20 years. This set pulls some of that service into the light and tells a story with the records he left behind.","While running Cleveland's premier low-cost studio for over 20 years, Thomas Boddie provided a huge service to the city's music scene.

Singles: 2007-2010,Ty Segall,by: Sean Fennessy,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25e9d034d5c69bf4b6a/1:1/w_160/167bee80.jpeg,2011-11-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16070-singles-2007-2010/,Goner,"""When you play music and you're a person on a stage, sometimes people can put you on a pedestal, and that can do a lot of things to your head. And... what if it actually exploded all over the walls during a show?"" That's Ty Segall speaking to SF Weekly earlier this year about his 2011 song, ""My Head Explodes"". It's a fairly straightforward description of a song that isn't terribly complicated. Guy sings. People watch. Guy's head explodes. It's not hard to picture Segall's head exploding. He sings hard and loud and with the shrill fury of a castrated animal. And he does this a lot. Since quitting his band, Epsilons, less than four years ago, Segall has become arguably the most exciting and probably the most prolific member of San Francisco's evolving garage rock scene, which also includes Thee Oh Sees, the Fresh & Onlys, and Sic Alps (with whom Segall formerly played). Since going solo, he's released five albums of original material; two split LPs; a live album; a cassette-only compilation; eight 7""s; four split EPs; a collaborative album with Mikal Cronin; and appeared on four compilation albums. The man is prolific. Trying to keep up will, if not enough make your head explode, at least incite heavy migraines. This year's Goodbye Bread, his first release for Drag City, is easily his best, the accumulation of learned songwriting tricks and a developing melodic sense, with an emphasis on sonic clarity and the influence of some august icons, notably John Lennon and Marc Bolan. (Oh yeah, Segall recorded a tribute EP to Bolan's T. Rex this year, too.) In the afterglow of Goodbye's success, Memphis label Goner Records, Segall's former home, has compiled Singles 2007-2010, a sort of refresher course and unheard odds-and-ends set that serves as a tenacious, temporary portrait of Segall. There are hints everywhere at the songwriter Segall would become, but Singles is much more about the flail of youth than honoring tradition. In a few years, he's garnered comparisons to a wide swath of artists, from Nuggets-friendly English bands like the Troggs and the Pretty Things, to working-class American menace-peddlers like the Stooges and Ramones, to early recordings by the White Stripes (especially prevalent on this comp), down to the late Jay Reatard, a significant guidepost for Segall. Singles is a stew mixing all of those ingredients and more. There are hints of Devo in the mechanized synth and drum tracks on early versions of ""So Alone"" and ""The Drag"". (Before forming his band, Segall often played all the instruments on his records, including drum machine.) Listen for ? and the Mysterians-like organ at the outset of ""Skin"", maybe the best song here. And in that voice, which vacillates from desperate howl to wallowing drone, a little Kurt Cobain, too. It's hard to know what's a relic and what's an advance here. Segall appears in love with surface imitation at times, while peeling the skin back at others. On the faux-British B-side ""Fuzzy Cat"", you can hear John Entwistle of the Who's gothic goof-off ""Boris the Spider"". The appearance of a cover of Chain Gang's coiled, minor punk masterpiece, ""Son of Sam"", feels like a cred grab, but an accomplished one. On ""Caesar"", which would later appear on 2010's Melted in more polished form, there's a little of the stomping acoustic rock that would become the underbelly of Goodbye Bread. Segall, like so many developing artists, seemed to be constantly toggling between ideas of himself. Singles, while comprising 25 songs, is still less than one hour's worth of music-- this iteration of Segall was economical. Only now, as his ambition grows, so do the lengths of his songs. Just one here exceeds three minutes-- it's the demo version of ""So Alone"", which was eventually whittled down to less than two and a half minutes for Horn the Unicorn. After acclaim for the elliptical and sometimes very pretty Goodbye Bread, one might assume Segall's left the crash-and-bash of Singles 2007-2010 behind. But then, his new single, ""Spiders"", is all doom and drone-- a violent, glorious devolution-- clocking in just under three minutes. So much for obvious trajectories.","After the success of Ty Segall's best album, this year's Goodbye Bread, his former home, the Memphis label Goner Records, has compiled the 25-track Singles 2007-2010. It's a sort of refresher course that serves as a temporary portrait of the restless garage rocker.

Talk That Talk,Rihanna,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b260ea9e61561daa68f7/1:1/w_160/7f771f3f.jpeg,2011-11-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16072-rihanna-talk-that-talk/,Def Jam,"""We found love in a hopeless place."" Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, Guetta-meets-""Sandstorm"" beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats these words almost 20 times. ""We Found Love"" ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's not much more that needs to be said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to something suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret. Need I remind you of some of her most powerful hooks: Ella-ella-ella-ay. Oh-na-na. Ay-ayy-ay-ayy-ay-ayy. But as anyone with a Twitter handle will tell you, these are chatty times, and in 2011, the pop landscape's fittingly caught between two maximalist extremes: the winking theatricality of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry, and the dribbling confessional-pop of Drake, Kanye West, and (yes, they're more alike than they'd like to believe) Taylor Swift. Barbados-born, millions-selling, armfuls-of-awards-winning Rihanna has found staggering success (23 years old; eleven #1 singles and rising) borrowing a little bit from each of these tendencies. Her recent music videos have dabbled in trendy pop artifice (check out her neon-hued, irresistibly smiley turn in Guetta’s ""Who’s That Chick?"" or the David LaChapelle-aping-- literally-- ""S&M""), while her brooding and personal 2009 album Rated R commented-- however obliquely-- on her public struggles. Rihanna seems more comfortable flitting between these two extremes than settling on either, but her past two albums have at least had some thematic cohesion. The same can't be said of Talk That Talk: Heavy on filler though it's only 11 tracks long, it feels not only slight but muddled, an assortment of half-baked ideas that never bloom. A stitched-together collection of club bangers, sleaze-pop missteps, and mid-tempo inspirational ballads, Talk That Talk feels at times like three different records, only one of which might have been any good. Of course, what we're supposed to be talking is about how this is Rihanna's ""dirtiest"" album yet. Early blog chatter reported to lots of critics blushing in preview listening sessions and making questionably bold declarations (""The dirtiest pop album since Madonna's Erotica!"") that suggested that they listen to very little pop radio, or that they have never been to an R. Kelly concert. Talk That Talk's raunchier moments should surprise no one: Rihanna's always been singing about sex-- she's just never shown such an unfortunate proclivity for cheesy lyrics and dessert metaphors. ""Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion,"" Ri commands on the embarrassingly literal ""Cockiness (I Love It)"", hoping the boldness of the delivery will distract you from thinking about what a clunky line it is (it won't, though Bangladesh's beats might). The Esther Dean-penned ""Drunk on Love"" features a weak chorus lyric and vocal whose bombast feels out of place in the track's laid back, xx-sampling atmosphere. Clocking in at a puzzling-yet-merciful one minute and 18 seconds, The-Dream co-produced ""Birthday Cake"" is even more heavy-handed (lots of icing puns). There are flickers of empowerment here, but mostly it proves little more than the fact that a female artist can be responsible for Jeremih-grade cheese, too. A Rihanna album has never been without the occasional lyrical misfire (""Sex in the air/ I don't care/ I love the smell of it"" comes to mind), but at least on a track like ""S&M"" she sounds like she's having fun. For a record so preoccupied with passion and pleasure, most of Talk That Talk feels unsuitably robotic. At least things start out strong. Talk That Talk's saving grace is its first stretch of tracks: the blithe and tropical ""You Da One"", ""We Found Love"", and the album's other Harris track ""Where Have You Been"", which doesn't stray much from the single's winning formula, a simple lyric of romantic longing that explodes into a club-ready beat. And though it's no ""Umbrella"", the Jay-Z reunion ""Talk That Talk"" is one of the more playful moments here, though I'll say that the patented H.O.V.-giggle doesn't feel entirely earned following a line like: ""Had it by a bladder/ She like 'oh I gotta pee'."" I've read some comment-section conspiracy theorists who believe Rihanna is in single-minded pursuit of Hot 100 domination, and the rate at which she's pumping out albums (roughly one a year since 2005) is an attempt to populate the singles chart until the end of time. There might be some truth to this (her singles collection is going to be killer), and with ""Death of the Album"" prophecies ever looming it's worth wondering whether or not that's such a crime. But 2011 found plenty of pop artists still breathing new life into the format: Beyonce's 4 and Lady Gaga's Born This Way were probably the most solid examples-- two bombastic records that also explore the nuance of their respective artists' personas. Talk That Talk tries too hard to send a more one-dimensional message and ends up falling flat: Rihanna's obviously going for sexy here, but her music's at its most alluring when she's blissed out in her own reverie, not taking the time to spell it all out for us.","Heavy on filler even though it's only 11 tracks long, Rihanna's sixth album feels not only slight but muddled, an assortment of half-baked ideas that never bloom.

Selections From Road Atlas 1998-2011,Calexico,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24e9d034d5c69bf4b5a/1:1/w_160/d902390d.jpg,2011-11-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16060-calexico-selections-from-road-atlas-1998-2011/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"The first time I saw Calexico live was in 1998, when they were opening for the Dirty Three at a tiny venue in Memphis. It was just Joey Burns and John Convertino up on stage, filling out their austere songs with resonant guitar fills and intricate drum patter. More than a decade later, I caught another show, this time at a large club in Washington, D.C., and it couldn't have been more different: The duo was joined by a small orchestra of musicians, who added horns, pedal steel, bass, and various other instruments. The sound was larger and louder, but equally cinematic. That contrast between early Calexico and later is telling. While their lineup has shifted almost constantly over the last few years, absorbing so many musicians in the Tucson scene, Burns and Convertino still approach Southwestern musical and oral traditions through the lens of indie rock records and film scores. And that approach has proved much more durable and rewarding than it might have seemed when they were openers instead of headliners. So it's fitting that this major retrospective release from the band isn't a greatest hits, but a collection of tour-only LPs, available on vinyl for the first time and summarized on a 16-track CD. Calexico have been releasing these limited-edition LPs on their own Our Soil Our Strength label since 1999, using them as clearinghouses for outtakes, one-offs, live cuts, and mostly studio experiments with various techniques, instruments, and musical genres. Packed together as Road Atlas 1998-2011, they form a compelling history of Burns and Convertino's partnership as they broke free of Giant Sand and Friends of Dean Martinez and gradually discovered what all they could do on their own. The vinyl set is almost a real-time account of a band feeling its way forward, and the fact that they never intended for these LPs to be ""real"" Calexico releases means they didn't have to worry about adhering to any particular approach or dynamic. Calexico could be a slippery entity, reassessing the possibilities with every note. In that regard, these LPs are essential to the band's identity. Even so, Road Atlas is by its very nature and limited availability (only 1,100 were released) aimed at diehard fans. Selections from Road Atlas proves more accessible, albeit not quite as revelatory or as immersive. Instead of adhering to strict chronology, the CD is sequenced to play like a Calexico album, which means, like Feast of Wire or Carried to Dust, it alternates between vocal-heavy songs and instrumental interstitials. It's not too difficult to distinguish early songs like ""El Morro"" from later tracks like ""Man Made Lake"", but the juxtapositions can be illuminating. With its full sound and Burns' desperate vocals, ""Griptape"", from 2005's The Book and the Canal, sets up the rough terrain of ""Glowing Heart of the World,"" from 98-99 Road Map, creating a dynamic that flows from Burns' vocal melody on the former to the lonely guitar strum and crashing finale of the latter. Selections is full of such passages, which blur the timeline and allow the songs to comment on one another. Even as the band has grown in lineup and in sound, Burns and Convertino remain the defining elements of Calexico's aesthetic. The drummer's complex rhythms allow a song like the live version of ""Lost in Space"" to essentially turn itself inside out, and he adds a jazzy spontaneity even to the rigid beats of ""Boletos"" and ""Entrenando a Los Tigres"". Burns may have started out as a slightly distant frontman with a limited vocal range, which actually reinforced certain themes of in-between-ness in their songs, but somewhere in the early 2000s, he developed a much more expressive delivery and became a much more engaged interpreter. On the dark cover of the 19th-century lullaby ""All the Pretty Horses"", he doesn't shrink from the sing-song melody or from the unsettling lyrics about flies feasting on a dead child. It's a fine showcase for both musicians, actually, as Convertino's drums comment on the verses with muted menace. Selections lacks the impact and narrative thrust of Calexico's best albums, but it doesn't sound like a hastily assembled odds-and-ends collection either. Instead, it showcases one of the band's defining and most distinguishing traits-- its ability to jumble and blur so many different styles and sounds together. Burns and Convertino ambitiously and unself-consciously assert that mariachi, meringue, folk, jazz, rock, soundtrack scores, and studio tinkering all exist on the same plane and all lead ultimately to the same dark desert heart. Road Atlas makes that point with more power and nuance, but Selections is persuasive in its own right.","This selection from a limited vinyl box set collecting tour-only LPs finds Joey Burns and John Convertino asserting that mariachi, meringue, folk, jazz, rock, soundtrack scores, and studio tinkering all exist on the same plane.

U.S. Girls on KRAAK,U.S. Girls,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b255c0084474cd0c1f65/1:1/w_160/8970c60f.jpeg,2011-11-22 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16064-us-girls-on-kraak/,K-RAA-K,"""It's pretty much all I listen to,"" Meghan Remy told me when I asked her about pop music last year. ""It's the only thing I am really influenced by."" That might come as a surprise when you hear the music of her solo project U.S. Girls, which buries simple melodies and vocal hooks under layers of noise and echo. She's even turned pop classics like Bruce Springsteen's ""Prove it All Night"" and B.J. Thomas' ""I Don't Have a Mind of My Own"" into basement dirges. But according to Remy, her lo-fi approach is more financial necessity than aesthetic choice. ""I would love to make a really clear recording,"" she said in the same interview. ""It's my dream!"" That dream is realized on U.S. Girls on KRAAK, which is significantly cleaner and less cacophonous than her previous two full-lengths. The increased clarity reveals some true pop gems, especially the stunning ""Island Song"", in which Remy's expressive singing sounds both stirring and exultant, inspiring chills and smiles in equal measure. Nearly as good are tracks bearing the influence of doo-wop, Motown, country, and R&B. Remy's love of the latter is especially clear in a Residents-like reworking of Brandy and Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine"". An album made solely of tunes like that would be strong enough, but what makes U.S. Girls on KRAAK great is how Remy mixes in sounds that are just as odd and idiosyncratic as her previous work. For every melodic nugget, there's a hallucinatory loop, a cloudy drone, or what sounds like the remnants of an exploded pop song-- half of a chorus, shards of a hook-- echoing in the distance. In lesser hands, alternating experiments and tunes could come off forced or gratuitous, but Remy connects them in a way that sounds natural and almost effortless. So when the creepy, voice-in-head ""Wells Dubs"" flows into the Patsy Cline-styled ""Peotone"", it's far from jarring. Instead, you can hear how Remy approaches minimalist loops and pop hooks as if they were the same thing and capable of the same infectious effect. Remy recently signed U.S. Girls to FatCat, so even glossier, higher-fidelity work might be in her future (and will perhaps come in a longer format, as U.S. Girls on KRAAK lasts only 26 minutes). If so, this album is a perfect launching point in that direction. But it's also a triumph on its own. Remy has widened and universalized her music without losing a drop of what previously made it so special and personal.","As U.S. Girls, Meghan Remy buries simple melodies and vocal hooks under layers of noise and echo.

New Album,Boris,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25a13d197565213a764/1:1/w_160/d41d504e.jpeg,2011-11-22 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16068-new-album/,Sargent House,"In recent years, Boris' self-mythologizing has been the most interesting part of their project. They've thrown plenty of curve balls since forming in 1992, but after 2005's Pink, they sped up the shifts and got weirder. The trio is also more willing to revisit its past and recontextualize its output with new styles and approaches. (It can often feel like an archival project, or like you're spying on someone else's déjà vu.) Atsuo (drums/vocals), Wata (guitar/vocals), and Takeshi (bass/vocals) were quiet after 2008's forgettable grab-bag Smile, but they've made up for the silence with three 2011 releases, Attention Please, Heavy Rocks (which echoes the 2002 release of the same name), and New Album, a generically titled collection that reinterprets tracks from those other records: ""Party Boy"", ""Hope"", ""Spoon"", and ""Les Paul Custom '86"" from AP; ""Jackson Head"" and ""Tu, La La"" from HR II. The 10-song collection, first released in Japan this past March before this rearranged/remastered version, is their most unabashed pop experiment; offering a dollop of sugary atmospherics and dewy hooks. The band insists on labeling this new angle ""extreme,"" though only because it's an extreme shift by a group best known for its doom metal and fuzzed-out rock. (It makes more sense than you might want to assume that they recently toured with New York City dream-pop group Asobi Seksu.) Conceptually, they were inspired by the use of Vocaloid software in Japanese pop music: the program takes typed lyrics and turns them into a song sung by ""an imaginary anime character vocalist."" New Album does have the feel of sumptuous, otherworldly animation. The band usually self-produces its records but brought on mainstream dance/pop arranger and producer Shinobu Narita, and the guy has a way with Candy Land gloss. All of the Attention Please and Heavy Rocks tracks sound better here-- chewier, more refined nuggets. But in most cases, it's more a comment on the quality of the other records than a heap of praise for this one. When the formula does succeed, the results do dazzle. ""Spoon"" offers a swirl of shoegaze detailed with chimes, synthesizers, atmospheric female vocals, and various bright, shiny things. In this case, as with NA's other best moments, Boris leave remnants of their usual sound within the gentler field: Bigger-than-twee drums, flanged feedback, and a heavy bass hold the elements together. You also get this in the shredding, cascading guitars of the amped ""Tu, La La"" and the mellower closer, ""Looprider"", a new track that comes off like Boris doing Yo La Tengo (via Sonic Youth). The best song, though, is ""Luna"", a rush of gurgling, humming dynamics that continues to hectically spiral upward for its eight minutes and change, creating soaring, stringed, crunchy goodness. (The original appeared on Adult Swim's Metal Swim compilation.) The other real standout-- kinetic, sunburst opener ""Flare""-- didn't appear elsewhere before New Album. But not everything works so well. Drummer/vocalist Atsuo told Rolling Stone the two albums that provided much of the source material were put together from ""one abandoned record."" You don't often see Boris short on ideas, largely because they can't seem to let them go-- even if they're running them into the ground. Here, the experiments too often come off as empty or forced: Decadent on the surface, hollow at the core. The slow, stoned bedroom-psych of the new song ""Pardon?"" bores. The sketchy, dorky techno pop of Attention Please's ""Les Paul Custom '86"" and Heavy Rocks' Jackson Head"" annoy (Boris as 8-Bit Muse?). During these stretches, you can hear the band struggling to write songs from outside their area of expertise. A pop song can look like a pop song, but that doesn't mean it is one. And as pretty as it can be, New Album is another minor Boris album in a string of minor Boris albums.","Boris' third album of 2011 finds the band, originally known for doom metal and fuzzed-out rock, swinging toward pop structures with decidedly mixed results.

Carrion Crawler/The Dream,Thee Oh Sees,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b206b1335d7bf169a390/1:1/w_160/9f508e95.jpeg,2011-11-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/,In the Red,"Propulsive, careening, and at times, openly dangerous, Thee Oh Sees are like the house band for a runaway train. Much of their appeal comes from the fact that they're a machine with four equal parts: the wide-eyed, cult-leader charisma of frontman John Dwyer, the effortless cool of keyboardist/singer Brigid Dawson, the pulsating low end of Petey Dammit, and the steel-solid rhythmic anchor of Mike Shoun. With unspeakable chemistry and an instinctual bond that borders on telepathic, the band has taken its wildly cacophonous and setlist-free live show to must-see status, turning music venues populated by arm-folding spectators into anarchic riot scenes. An Oh Sees show is a place where combing the floor for your shoes when the house lights come on becomes ritualistic, where getting kicked in the face by a renegade crowd-surfer provokes a shit-eating grin instead of a scowl. Most of the band's best albums serve as recorded documents of their live sets; you can practically hear Dwyer swallowing microphones and spitting upwards to the rafters. Castlemania-- Thee Oh Sees' first record of 2011-- made it easier to remember that the band started out as Dwyer's solo project, a vehicle forged as a left turn from the eardrum terrorism of his garage-punk cult heroes Coachwhips. Rife with kaleidoscopic woodwind arrangements and vocals akin to the green cartoon monsters that grace the cover art of many Oh Sees full-lengths, the record was a refreshingly weird slab of hallucinogenic psych-pop, a headphones record for the arty garage-rock über-faithful. (You know, the kind of people who own more than two volumes of Back From the Grave or take a road trip to Gonerfest every single year.) The opening seconds of Carrion Crawler/The Dream feature the squawking of a saxophone-- the last remnants of Castlemania's woodwind-centered psychedelia sputtering out like smoke from a 1920s automobile that ran out of gas. Just as Castlemania was the apotheosis of Dwyer's cracked vision as a singer/songwriter, Carrion Crawler/The Dream showcases the full-band version of Thee Oh Sees at the height of their powers. Many of the album's songs have been road-tested for over a year, and Intelligence brain-trust Lars Finberg was drafted as the band's second drummer. Instead of disrupting the dynamic, Finberg fits in perfectly, occasionally adding some polyrhythmic flair, bolstering the already tight and rock-solid rhythm section. Dammit, Shoun, and now Finberg serve as the grounded basis that allow the songs to veer off on wild tangents without completely falling apart. Having the bassist and two drummers holding everything in place gives the high end room to explore, a task in part handled by the extraordinary vocal interplay of Dwyer and Dawson. In spite of the former being the creative nucleus of the band, there is no ""lead singer"" designation in Thee Oh Sees-- Dwyer and Dawson singing nearly every lyric in unison. As Dawson's straight-laced vocal presence stays in line on most of the songs, Dwyer naturally plays the madman, his voice coasting below, zigzagging between, and occasionally even scaling above hers-- the latter reminiscent of the way Black Francis would often take the higher octave over Kim Deal on several Pixies tracks. Dawson provides poppy ""ba-bas,"" while Dwyer shouts his head off on ""Contraption/Soul Desert"", and she's there to eerily coo while he's practically speaking in tongues on ""Crack in Your Eye"". But more often than not, it sounds like Dwyer is singing backup for Dawson, a testament to how equal the parts in Thee Oh Sees really are. Scratching away at his strings with bloodthirsty ferociousness, Dwyer's guitar playing is best described in terms usually reserved for feral cats. His solos are not as much foot-on-the-monitor, spotlight-capturing moments as they are products of primal instinct. This is particularly evident on the album's two longform tracks, the two songs that combine to make up the album's title. Much like last year’s ""Warm Slime""-- the audio equivalent of a pro-wrestling iron man match-- ""Carrion Crawler"" and ""The Dream"" experiment with what happens when you tighten things to a breaking point and then let go. Short blasts of distortion leave their mark throughout the album, guitar tones evoking the image of exploding paint cans in a mid-size room, adding to the unruly spirit of the band's albums and live sets. See, Thee Oh Sees understand the intrinsic value of making a huge mess.","Where Castlemania was the apotheosis of frontman John Dwyer's vision as a singer/songwriter, Thee Oh Sees' second collection of 2011 showcases the full-band version of the SF gargage rockers at the height of their powers.

Sepalcure,Sepalcure,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b252c0084474cd0c1f5e/1:1/w_160/bbdb3f29.jpeg,2011-11-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/,Hotflush,"Bass producers tend to treat innovation like daily prayer: If not duly performed at regular intervals, some ill-defined Very Bad Thing will happen. The thirst for innovation is such that some scene-watchers have likened current bass music to post-punk, stratifying its sounds in search of growth. Previous British dance movements-- drum'n'bass and garage-- found such terrifying end-games that the bass scene has made a constant effort to never stop swimming. To brand an artist as someone who simply executes, however masterfully, is to damn him with faint praise. Increasingly, bass producers have looked backward (thumping, linear 4/4 bangers) or forward (mutated footwork fever-dreams), largely ignoring (as Pitchfork writer Philip Sherburne put it in discussion), the fertile terrain between Burial and Joy Orbison. On their debut full-length for Scuba's Hotflush label, New York duo Sepalcure nimbly incorporate current trends but arrive at a sound-- politely mysterious rhythms put to life by haunted vocal samples-- that's familiar and rich. Sepalcure is a collaboration between two dance veterans, Praveen Sharma and Travis Stewart. That their album scans as a bit of a melting pot should not surprise. Sharma runs dance media hub Percussion Lab and records misty, retro-futuristic house as Braille. Stewart hops genres as Machinedrum, whose footwork-fusion album Room(s) is widely regarded as one of the year's best dance releases (I regret underrating its idiosyncrasies). Admittedly influenced by the scores of talent massing on forward-thinking bass labels like Hotflush and Hessle Audio, their collaboration was the result of boredom and opportunity (Sharma's girlfriend, visual artist Sougwen Chung, was studying abroad; she handles all of the group's visuals). Some combination of serendipity and skill saw the duo's first tracks fall into the hands of Mary Anne Hobbs and Paul Rose (Scuba); two well-received EPs later, a short two-week recording session birthed Sepalcure. That Sepalcure is so balanced and organized can be attributed to the experience and seeming calm of its principals; that it sounds so lively and inviting is the greater achievement. While syncopated rhythms-- pattering cymbals and kicks with now-familiar handclaps-- and probing bass sponge up dubstep's urban paranoia, Sharma and Stewart add plenty of more explicitly emotional touches to their work. How else to explain the Who's ""See Me, Feel Me"" stretched transparent over, um, ""See Me Feel Me""? (And how the hell did that sample get cleared?) Or the hammy Italo-disco pianos that build up under the fingernails of ""Hold On"" and ""Yuh Nuh See""? Sepalcure's moody haze and mid-song shifts prevent it from being dance-floor fodder (""The One"" is a welcome exception), but neither is it music by which to lonesomely stare at rainstorms. Vocals play a prominent role throughout. During their best moments, Sharma and Stewart subject rave-y house divas to dubstep's pinched nausea, turning the gospel-like fervor of their sources into grimy hymns. (Those new to the group should acquaint themselves with early single ""Love Pressure"".) ""Breezin"" is especially devoted, its tremulous refrain-- ""Mountains high and low!""-- ascending above its buzzy synths. The duo recorded many of the instruments live, and there is a punch especially to the pianos (electric and acoustic) that their contemporaries frequently lack. They layer these instruments expertly, and tracks such as lead single ""Pencil Pimp"" and ""Eternally Yrs"" function as bass-y, house-y suspensions: discrete parts bound by weightless float. Tufts of melody chunk off ""Yuh Nuh See"", as its meticulous, six-note sequence snakes around a vocal hum and sprinkled, choral beauty. Straightforward descriptions of Sepalcure-- a finely manicured mix of dubstep, house, UK funky, and footwork-- make it sound pedestrian, even contrived. The reality is anything but; Sharma and Stewart have found an alleyway that few other producers have traversed in 2011. Bass producers can treasure-hunt all they want, but increasingly it feels like someone should stay behind to stack the doubloons. Stewart is moving to Berlin, casting doubt on Sepalcure's future. If they never record again, their collaboration may mirror their achievement here: an evolutionary moment, familiar and brief enough to gloss over, rich enough to return to.","On their full-length debut, the New York duo of Praveen Sharma (Percussion Lab, Braille) and Travis Stewart (Machinedrum) nimbly incorporate current bass music trends and arrive at a sound that's familiar and rich.

Youth II EP,Deptford Goth,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2325e6ef95969322253/1:1/w_160/e4f5b79d.png,2011-11-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16040-youth-ii-ep/,Merok,"Deptford Goth is the solo electronic project of Daniel Woolhouse, a 27-year-old, British art school graduate who made his debut last year after uploading a single track, ""Real Love Fastasy"", to his MySpace. Up until a few months ago, when he began work on his debut LP for Merok, Woolhouse was working as a teacher's assistant in a primary school in South London-- widely recognized as the birthplace of dubstep, and home to a few, better-known singer-producers like James Blake and Jamie Woon, who offer a similar hybrid of sluggish club beats, expressive sample-cutting, manual key work, and processed vocals. The project's name is deceptive. Woolhouse doesn't live in the Deptford district of London but in nearby Peckham, and he's no more of a ""goth"" than fellow bedroom producers like Holy Other, oOoOO, and Balam Acab-- although they do share an affinity for melancholy glamour and chintzy romance. At a time when cultivating an air of mystery has become one of the most transparent PR moves in the business, we can read Deptford Goth's self-branding attempts in one of two ways. Either he is being half-hearted about it, offering up a few easy signifiers for ""dark"" and ""dubsteppy"" in an effort to bait fans of the Tri Angle/Merok contingent, or he is being overly self-conscious and trying to make a statement about how easy it is to get a certain group of people to pay attention these days. The good news is that Woolhouse seems to have put a lot more thought into the four, quietly action-packed synth-pop numbers on Youth II, his first EP. For someone whose stated roots are in acoustic music, his use of crooked drum programming, buttery synths, and soulful background crooning shows economy and restraint. These qualities are especially evident on downtempo opener ""No Man"", which is full of pregnant pauses. This is music that builds through the addition and subtraction of small details, such as a melismatic glitch in Deptford's de facto Auto-Tune voice, or the zippy, melody that kicks in midway through album single ""Real Love Fantasy""-- a chirpy trance homage to Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"". ""Time"", by far the EP's standout, contrasts rocky beats and bass wobble with a very large-sounding synth melody. Vague existential musings about a dead-end relationship (""I don't know where I'm going/ Guess I'm leaving/ Time keeps pushing me"") trade off with an almost celebratory refrain: ""I'm a believer."" As with the similarly worded mantra at the close of John Maus' recent We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves, the song's poignance hinges on the impossibility of taking it completely seriously, as the words come from a processed voice that is midway between human and machine. EP closer ""Youth II"" offers another tragi-comic slice of technologically mediated emotion, contrasting his clipped vocalizations with oceanic synth chords that ultimately say so much more. Like electronic soul stylists to whom he is compared (writing for the The Guardian, for example, Paul Lester invokes the ""spectral R&B"" of How to Dress Well and Holy Other and ""the dubstep pop"" of Messrs. Blake and Woon""), Deptford Goth's music is partly about making music-- and self-expression in general-- in the digital age, yet another soundtrack for lonely BitTorrent downloading and emoticon-flecked sentimentality. If you're unfamiliar with this sphere, it's a stirring listen; if you know it well, it's less so.","Deptford Goth is the solo electronic project of Daniel Woolhouse and this four-song EP shares an affinity for melancholy glamour with artists like Holy Other, oOoOO, and Balam Acab.

FRKWYS Vol. 8,Blues ControlLaraaji,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2469d034d5c69bf4b49/1:1/w_160/8aef7ef3.jpeg,2011-11-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16056-frkwys-vol-8/,Rvng Intl.,"In Father James Martin's recent book, Between Heaven and Mirth: Why Joy, Humor, and Laughter Are at the Heart of the Spiritual Life, he notes that some of Jesus' parables had a wry sense of humor underlying them, albeit the context (crucial for any comic) has been lost over centuries of translations. But if you think of it, a camel squeezing through a needle's eye is Monty Python-level absurd. The New Age artist Laraaji (born Edward Larry Gordon) understands such a spiritual dichotomy, offering workshops not just in deep listening but also in deep laughter. His blog even summarizes his skill-set as so: ""Celestial Music Performances and Seriously Playful Laughter Workshops."" For most music fans, Laraaji remains best known for recording an ambient album with Brian Eno after the latter happened upon the artist improvising on zither in Washington Square Park. The resultant record, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, catapulted Laraaji into the upper echelons of that then-nascent genre, even if albums like 1978's Celestial Vibration (reissued by Soul Jazz) and 1987's Essence/ Universe transcend all musical nametags, vitamin stores, lucid dreaming practices, and crystal healing sessions to send its listeners up into the ether. And like other similarly inclined noisemakers (including but not limited to Emeralds, Oneohtrix Point Never, White Rainbow, and Hatchback), when New York's Blues Control began to explore psychedelic music from the chakra-relaxing end of the musical spectrum, it led them directly to Laraaji's back catalog. Similarly inclined to melodic improvisation, percussive playing, hazy instrument treatments, and sprawling soundscapes-- as evidenced on previous albums like Local Flavor and*""Puff""*-- it makes a strange sort of sense that Blues Control would reach out to Laraaji for a collaborative album released as part of the RVNG label's ongoing FRKWYS series. Sonically, it makes for an exquisite follow-up to the previous entry. Recorded in an upstate studio over the course of a single winter's day, the four tracks that constitute the LP (not to mention the sprawling bonus tracks available via digital download and-- in a nod to the New Age genre-- cassette) feel of a piece. Blues Control's telltale murk is evident from the start of ""Awakening Day"", somehow discombobulating and evocative, full of echoing percussion and effervescent melodies from Russ Waterhouse's six-string and Lea Cho's electric keyboard. It actually takes a while before Laraaji's strummed zither rises to the surface, only to have the elegant track slowly dissolve into sounds of running water and trickling percussion. Laraaji's effects-laden strings kick off the 11-minute exploration ""Light Ships"", as do his bellowing vocal improvisations. Piano and zither ebb and rise like oceanic tides, but soon that deep voice of Laraaji's turns into echoing laughter. Another belly laugh emanates from Laraaji on the half-hour bonus track ""Somebody Scream"", and there's also a chuckle as the droning closer ""Freeflow"" fades from view. From where does such mirth arise? There are no definite answers, but surely the body-moving drum shuffle that leads into ""City of Love"" will startle more than a few listeners as the collaboration somehow moves from Earl Young-worthy Philly disco into cascading kalimba and weightless ambiance into the sort of noise gurgle that Blues Control are expert at. Across the four tracks though, it soon becomes hard to distinguish the two separate entities at play, which by this point is to be expected. As the FRKWYS series continues to make evident, the perceived generation gap between bustling avant-garde noise musicians and their more steadfast New Age elder statesmen is-- funnily enough-- narrow indeed.","For Vol. 8 of RVNG's FRKWYS series, New York's Blues Control teamed with Brian Eno-associated zither player Laraaji for a collaborative LP that moves from disco to cascading kalimba, weightless ambiance, and gurgling noise.

(together) EP,The Antlers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24bb1335d7bf169a3ef/1:1/w_160/50a64192.jpeg,2011-11-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16057-together/,Frenchkiss,"Prior to the release of Burst Apart, the Antlers' Peter Silberman delivered a track-by-track breakdown of his band's gorgeous, subtly gripping record to Drowned in Sound-- the explanation of ""Rolled Together"" was particularly revelatory on three levels. First off, this is a pretty strange exercise for a lyricist as blunt as Silberman-- rarely does an Antlers song leave much to the imagination in regards to ""what it's about."" Secondly, he went on to call it the result of an obsession with Boards of Canada, which also struck me as odd since it sounds almost exactly like Sigur Rós' ""Svefn-G-Englar"". Lastly, he described the track as ""best heard stoned with friends."" If so, while ""Rolled Together"" is Burst Apart's musical centerpiece, it's the thematic outlier on a record that speaks about sex and alcohol in an unusually austere and often negative manner, endorsing solitude and emotional sobriety as a corrective to the inevitable turmoil each brings. ""Rolled Together"" is better understood as the jumping off point for the odds and sods collection of the (together) EP, since it proves that, despite what *Hospice *and Burst Apart may have led you to believe, Silberman isn't holed up in a Brooklyn apartment waiting for his heart to be atomized between albums. That's not to say drugs were clearly a major influence here-- but the indie rock remix album is pretty much on the level of a bowl-passing session or drum circle in terms of pastimes that can be enjoyed only by the people directly participating in them. Hospice and Burst Apart were closed narrative circuits, so any sort of mixed bag from Antlers was bound to be jarring, and indeed, each entry into this hodgepodge of refurbishments, live performances, and outtakes exhibits its own unique set of errant artistic impulses. Take their cover of the xx's ""VCR"", for instance. Look beyond the fact that sampling, remixing, or covering the xx is quickly becoming a tiresome rite of passage and remember why the impact of xx continues to manifest: While the songwriting was surely exquisite, its striking minimalism, romantic candor, and sonic intimacy still cuts through the indistinct clutter many of the bands reinterpreting their music don't even realize they're responsible for. Problem isn't that the version here stays true to none of the original's artistic ideals, but it doesn't even sound like ""VCR"" reconfigured to the Antlers specs of passionate, electronic pop-- everything gets soused in a whorl of reverb, to the point where a Doppler effect on Silberman's vocals is the only thing breaking through. For whatever reason, the same tactics are applied to ""I Don’t Want Love (Peter's Version)"".  Where the sleek and silvery contours of the original added a layer of resolute determination to the narrator's conflicted take on physical attachment, the solo version just turns maudlin and ponderous under its blown-out echo, something akin to hearing the guy down the hall work through cover versions of Grace. While those two are at odds with their expressive underpinning, the reduxes of ""Parentheses"" and ""French Exit"" unwisely ignore any sort of emotional context altogether, and Silberman simply becomes a trebly sound effect amidst tumbling, metallic loops. But those all serve as prelude to the physical bulk of (together), tied up in three consecutive in-studio collaborations whose combined length nearly equals that of Burst Apart. Take your pick as to what's the more glaring sign of a total quality-control void-- the motley collage serving as the cover art or the nearly two minutes of studio chatter and dead air that precedes each live cut. And yet, they still sound like they could've used more time to plan things out: previously, ""Hounds"" was an impossibly delicate meditation on fresh wounds and codependent fragility, but Nicole Atkins' interjections of husky blues notes triggers the same sort of nose-wrinkling gag reflex of taking a shot of straight vodka. And there's a time and place for Alan Palomo to test out the wild oscillations of his homemade synths-- namely, Neon Indian songs. Here, they simply break the beatific spell of ""Rolled Together"" before the Antlers lock into its mixed-meter sway (which features some pretty nifty falsetto swoops), at which point you forget he's even there. And yet, it's the most blatantly self-indulgent song here that makes (together) ultimately impossible to truly dislike, because it's ultimately impossible to truly take seriously. And that would be a version of ""Parentheses"" with Bear in Heaven that would've been the second-longest track on Lulu, and to its credit, one of the least grueling*.* Even in the post-CD age, we've become accustomed to marathon song lengths housing a bit of false advertising, but there's no hidden track, no gaping vacuum of silence, just literally 18 minutes of the Antlers and Bear in Heaven jamming on ""Parentheses"", at its core a three-and-a-half-minute song based on a single drum loop. Frankly, I'm surprised they made it all the way to the end-- halfway through listening, I could get a snack or check my email. They didn't have that option. Look*, (together)* is borderline unlistenable taken as a whole, but it actually makes me like Burst Apart even more, since I can add ""tremendously edited"" to its long list of redeeming qualities. And really, it's less of an indictment of the Antlers as it is of (together)'s format. After all, the Antlers have produced a total of two great records since 2009, approximately two more than the entire cottage industry of indie remix albums has in its history. You know, drug abuse, divorce, war, and death all get a bad rap, but somehow they've succeeded in inspiring great art for 40 or so minutes, where letting a couple of friends fuck with your songs has failed about 100% of the time.","On this EP of odds and ends-- featuring guest spots from Neon Indian, Bear in Heaven, Nicole Atkins, and an xx cover-- each entry offers its own set of errant artistic impulses.

iSLAND,G-Side,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b242ea9e61561daa68ce/1:1/w_160/a652614b.jpeg,2011-11-21 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16053-g-side-the-island/,Slow Motion Soundz,"In less than two years, G-Side have gone from being one of the most slept-on rap groups around, to well, kind of taken for granted. That will happen when hip-hop's having its RSS-obsessed, gimmick-happy, bloggy moment, and ST and Clova's concerns are consistency and ever so slightly widening the lane they've carved out for themselves. So, on iSLAND-- the equally estimable follow-up to January's THE ONE... COHESIVE-- they're still indefatigably grinding, and just as geeked-up on the fact that people write about them in magazines and on blogs. But there's something darker creeping into their music here, confounding the occasional misreading of COHESIVE's glowing, cathartic hip-hop as ""escapist"" or head-in-the-clouds. Forever right there in the background is their keen awareness that, when it comes down to it, they ain't all that important to this rap shit. That's why every interview is a huge deal to them. There's also their past, rife with tragedy and loss-- bouncing around in foster homes, family members lost to cancer and addiction-- which they tastefully reveal only in snippets. These guys have something to legitimately want to escape, but they also have enough experience to know that things don't always get better-- so they remain sneering, smart products of their environment, always prepared for the worst. On ""Gettin' It"", a team-up with Stalley-- a similarly minded member of rap's scrappy, new sincerity-- ST admits, ""I've been havin' nightmares of being broke at 30."" A baggy Tame Impala sample suggests a world bigger than regional hip-hop, but the rigid, glitching drums slap those dreams back down to the earth. G-Side are not cynics, though. They can't help but exude positivity, and the production here, from in-house crew the Block Beataz, as well as Parallel Thought (best known for work with undergrounders like Tame One and C-Rayz Walz), remains typically vibrant. Supported by background singers PH and Joi Tiffany throughout, there's quiet storm R&B on the title track, Ernie Isley-like guitar on ""Atmosphere"", and a Bacharach-gone-rap sound on ""Stay-cation"". It sounds like hip-hop for the over-30 crowd, which fits G-Side's hard-working, Bill Cosby-meets-From Niggas to Gods, ""boot-straps""-tinged individuality. Wisely, the Huntsville up-and-comers also graft their concerns onto something much larger than their hometown and internet fanbase. They're about to pop off, but they're not quite there, which is a fitting analogue for the United States, which seems to be slowly crawling out from under a recession but shit, man, not soon enough. On ""Rising Sun"" from 2009's Huntsville International, they boasted that they were ""W2 boys""-- regular guys with legal hustles-- but now, they refer to taxes as ""that Uncle Sam scam."" G-Side are part of the wizened, frustrated working class that can't help but feel like the government's nothing but a money-laundering system for the super rich and therefore, not to be trusted. ""Rabbits"", iSLAND's finest track, thanks to a Goodie Mob-esque hook and a beyond dusted moan of synths and rattling percussion, is a cruel vision of the world as a place where you hunt or become the hunted. ""16 Shots"" features a song-stealing verse from Bentley that doesn't see the difference between the U.S.-sanctioned murder of Gaddafi and the assassinations of Malcolm and Martin. Appropriately, this the album where Clova, usually considered the more tormented, lesser of the two MCs, finally gets to shine. Here his voice, which communicates seething disgust with the world, is also so distinct-- a lisping whisper of a rasp-- that it feels painfully sincere, and commands iSLAND. He begins ""Our Thing"" by confessing, ""I hate relationships, never put my heart up in it,"" and ends the song with a uncomfortably calm monologue that invokes the recession while acknowledging the double bind that dedicated hard work is alienating: ""Niggas ain't seeing their kids, niggas ain't with they wives…/ This shit ain't all sweet man, I don't know what the fuck these niggas done told y'all./ We're just out here surviving."" No matter that, just a few songs before, G-Side wrapped up a mid-album, warm-hearted suite of R&B raps with a love song dedicated to hard work called ""Luv 2 Hustle"". It's not that grinding is what they want to be doing, it's just that, right now, there doesn't seem to be another option.","On this darker follow-up to January's THE ONE... COHESIVE, the Huntsville, Alabama, rappers are still grinding, and just as geeked-up on the fact that people write about them in magazines and on blogs.

Hexagons EP,Esben and the Witch,by: Carrie Battan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2385e6ef9596932225f/1:1/w_160/9e0186e5.jpeg,2011-11-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16045-hexagons-ep/,Matador,"From their onset, the Brighton-based Esben and the Witch have excelled at the aesthetic component of recent goth-leaning music. Of the many emerging dark, female-fronted acts, they've got some of the slickest packaging, complete with a name derived from a grisly Danish fairy tale and a list of ""Band Interests"" on Facebook that concludes with, ""Victoriana, Romance, Ghosts."" The follow-up to their debut full-length, Violet Cries-- a new EP called Hexagons-- takes their curative framework a step further-- it's a concept piece made up of six Roman-numerically ordered ""Hexagons"" with dramatic parentheticals: ""Hexagons I (The Fall)"", ""Hexagons II (The Flight)"", et cetera. Its release also coincided with a week-long webcast event called ""Hexagons Cinema"", in which the band streamed a series of footage shot in the UK's oldest functioning cinema. At the very least, Esben have shown themselves fine scholars of textbook aspects of spook. But much like on Violet Cries, all of Hexagons' thoughtful ornamentation only emphasizes how frustratingly plotless the songs are. These songs are sparer than much of the material from Violet Cries, often centered around dramatic piano lines and bare acoustic guitar sheathed in haunting echoes. The bookending tracks, ""Hexagons I (The Fall)"" and ""Hexagons VI (The Thaw)"", aren't even so much songs as they are brief, ambient reminders of the grim mood the trio wants you to experience but seems incapable of fleshing out. By comparison, ""Hexagons II (The Flight)"" and ""Hexagons III (The Surge)"" sound tightly structured and concussive. But they still fall flat: The latter, for instance, hints at the band's promising post-rock tendencies by building a thick, apocalyptic guitar line, but before it's allowed to peak and crash, it peters out and devolves into more thin, aimless piano. None of these cuts reach the guttural fullness of Violet Cries cuts ""Marching Song"" or ""Warpath"", two strong tracks that probably should have been used as templates for Esben's future recordings. Instead, they instilled listeners with what now feels like false hope. In the absence of compelling cores, these songs are carried, sometimes solely, by frontwoman Rachel Davies' strong and brooding British-accented vocals. Hexagons also emphasizes the extent to which the indiesphere wants to embrace a goth revival in the wake of the success of artists like Zola Jesus, and it highlights an experimental phase that can easily misfire. There's a sense here that these dark waters are being tested unsuccessfully, explored using well-crafted embellishments without the raw songwriting materials needed to deliver on their promise.","The goth-leaning Brighton band's follow-up to their debut LP is a concept piece made of six Roman-numerically ordered ""Hexagons"" with dramatic parentheticals.

An Album by Korallreven,Korallreven,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2355e6ef95969322259/1:1/w_160/be3e9bd3.jpeg,2011-11-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16042-an-album-by-korallreven/,HybrisAcéphale,"More than two years passed between Swedish duo Korallreven's first single, the glittering, acoustically-tinged ""Loved-Up"", and their full-fledged debut LP, An Album by Korallreven. In internet years, that's practically a decade, but then, Korallreven and their fellow countrymen work at a pace that exists outside normal measurements of time (the exception being jj, who seemingly churn out slices of heavy-lidded pop at will). It took Korallreven close to a year to follow ""Loved-Up"" with last year's ""The Truest Faith""; the arrival of An Album by Korallreven itself was promised for later in 2010. Considering bedroom dreamers have been waiting four years (and counting) for a follow-up to Gothenburg duo the Tough Alliance's A New Chance, though, maybe we're lucky An Album by Korallreven exists at all. They do have things in common with the Tough Alliance beyond citizenship and a leisurely working pace: Both acts are duos, both embrace a color palette of popular music so widespread it's difficult to describe what they make with a catch-all descriptor, and both ultimately draw deep from indie pop's dewy-eyed tradition (Korallreven especially-- one half of the band's Daniel Tjäder, who spends time leafing through the Sarah and Labrador catalogues as a member of the Radio Dept.) For all their sentiments, the Tough Alliance are also arch and fairly political; Korallreven, on the other hand, are more concerned with surface beauty, applying layers of gauze that add immense, weightless density to their own pop delicacies. In a sense, it's music that you don't necessarily have to think about, which is fine, of course-- even the most bookish of Sincerely Yours/Service/Acéphale completists need something to lose themselves in now and again. The album's shortest cut, ""A Surf on Endorphins"", is a redux of ""The Truest Faith""'s rolling theme, awash in coyote howls and static distance. As its title suggests, the song's meant to provoke emotion, albeit far from the energized sort. During the bleeping, hypnotic centerpiece ""Keep Your Eyes Shut"", the phrase, ""A dream within a dream,"" is repeated like a mantra. Indie pop's history dictates that many of its practitioners are, first and foremost, ardent fans of the music that's influenced the music they make; accordingly, Tjäder and cohort Marcus Joons come across less as artists as they do expert curators. They move from the 808s of ""As Young as Yesterday"" (a signifier reminiscent of once-label mates Salem, whom Korallreven have featured in mixes frequently) to the space-disco-via-pastoral-ambient beauty of nine-minute album closer ""Comin' Down"" with the ease of a single brushstroke. The pair's series of mixes (the most recent being A Dream Within a Dream) flow with expert sequencing that betrays the amateur nature of mix culture circa 2011. It's no surprise, then, that An Album by Korallreven works best as an album-length experience, its structure suggesting a sort of trip-- spiritual or chemical or otherwise. It's an album of quiet excellence, one that aims to soundtrack your most idle thoughts while romantically demanding your attention. That said, it doesn't really matter how An Album by Korallreven resonates within our world, when Tjäder and Joons are so intent in creating their own.","More than two years passed between the gauzy Swedish electro-pop duo's first single and their debut LP. An Album by Korallreven, an expertly curated collection featuring guest spots from Victoria Bergsman and Julianna Barwick, was worth the wait.

Hello Sadness,Los Campesinos!,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22db1335d7bf169a3c7/1:1/w_160/25953bca.jpeg,2011-11-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16036-hello-sadness/,Arts & CraftsWichita,"The music of Los Campesinos! has always been about straddling the line between sincerity and irony. It's a tough game to play, but thanks to songwriter Gareth Campesinos' wry humor and self-deprecation, the band has been able to make a career out of writing songs where breakups literally equal death. The music is intensely personal, but it's equally as inclusive-- Gareth paints himself as having it worse than anyone, but the unspoken acknowledgment that makes the band churn is that he really just has it as bad as everyone else. Hello Sadness is the band's fourth album, and though not much has changed with the band itself, the ground underneath which LC! stand has shifted. Gareth's style of writing-- naked oversharing that goes far past the margins of his pad-- used to feel like a natural outgrowth of the type of discourse found at places like LiveJournal and Blogger, but those mediums are dinosaurs now, replaced by the opacity of Tumblr and the short, controlled blasts of Twitter. Likewise, the band's serrated twee is not exactly in fashion in the world of indie rock right now, a truth that's an undercurrent of their announcement late last year that they would be distributing a quarterly fanzine. But, if LC! are the last men and women left holding the flag for an antiquated era of indie rock, it has only intensified their vitality to those looking for more than chillwave's call to tune in, turn on, and drop out. Though the album is arguably the band's darkest yet, it starts off with both the album's peppiest song and one of LC!'s best singles to date. ""By Your Hand"" finds Gareth at the very infancy of a budding romance, and it casts him as a sort of lovable hero, a role that he inhabits when he's not, say, fantasizing about burning the skin off his hands before going to a palmist. Gareth narrates himself initiating another round of dirty texting before breaking into one of the more memorable passages he's penned: his fooling around with ""fate""-- ""a cruel mistress, girl""-- who suggests that the two go back to her place, where ""fate"" then, naturally, vomits on him. He does this with gusto, which is accentuated by the chorus, wherein the entire band shouts, ""By your hand is the only end that I foresee."" The exuberance, not just for the romance itself but for his eventual end at the hand of his lover, is crucial to Gareth's ability to write songs about what happens when the relationship is at the other end of the spectrum. We know that he's always coming back for more, even when the rest of us can't stomach it. Otherwise Hello Sadness is an album largely obsessed with themes of despair and images of death, but Gareth is an able gallows humorist. On the album's final track he enters a slaughterhouse where he sees his guts strung up, only for him to be turned away because ""his sad eyes are too much to bear."" On ""Baby, I Got the Death Rattle"" he gets frostbite from scribbling dicks in the snow for every girl that wouldn't sleep with him before watching a halo slip from the top of his lover's head and, presumably, decapitate her. And then there is ""Every Defeat a Divorce (Three Lions)"", Gareth's long-coming ode to the English soccer team, wherein crosses on the pitch become crucifixes and the team's crest nearly claws him to death. It is the album's centerpiece, if only because for Gareth, and for a lot of us, the one thing more wrenching than romance is sports. These songs are genuinely affecting, though, both because they explore the darkest depths of a romantic's psyche and because LC! have transitioned rather seamlessly into maturity. The fizzy, excitable songwriting of their early output is far in the past, and they've learned to write songs that build and swell to moments that can knock you off your feet (""To Tundra"" is the killer here). Gareth also explores his range as a vocalist to great success, stretching himself to sing melodically and in a strikingly deeper voice. His vocals have long been a breaking point for many non-converts, and while Gareth hasn't morphed into King Krule, his impressive singing here bodes well for the future of a band whose music largely revolves around him. The buzz has long worn off of Los Campesinos!, but Hello Sadness is their fourth straight great album, and each of them is close enough in quality that you'd likely get split numbers if you conducted a straw poll at one of the band's shows. Even if there is no breakthrough moment for them, there is something to be said for a band that is this young, this consistent, and this committed to both carrying the torch for and freshening up a style of indie rock that has, for the moment at least, been left behind.","Los Campesinos! haven't changed much on their fourth album, their darkest yet.

Inni,Sigur Rós,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2335e6ef95969322256/1:1/w_160/54b037aa.jpeg,2011-11-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16041-inni/,XL,"Inni arrived in stores with plenty to keep Sigur Rós fans occupied-- over two hours of music spread across two discs, as well as a handsomely shot DVD-- but last week, there was a piece of unintentional bonus material capable of changing its context completely after the fact: news that the band was back in the studio. Save for one track that ended up on the cutting room floor, Inni was taken from the band's final show in London before their indefinite hiatus and the launch of Jonsi's solo career, the success of which was a foregone conclusion. So it was easy to see Inni as an attempt at a totemic, final word on the Icelandic group or at least a 4Q sweep at completist dollars. As of now, it still does maintain something of a sense of finality, but only as a smartly arranged retrospective of a rewarding decade that began with an unprecedented sound and ended up with the sense that complete ownership of that sound had people taking them for granted. Though basically any concert performance from Sigur Rós has been considered transcendent due to its underlying material, both of their live documents have had some sort of distinguishing characteristic. 2007's Heima stripped them down to acoustic essentials and Windham Hill vibes, the novelty manifesting in how closely they were willing to lean into their accusations of being New Age For Radiohead Fans. Here, you bear witness to the closest incarnation of Sigur Rós as a rock band comprised of human beings who play stringed instruments you could buy at Target as opposed to some sort of mythic conjurers-- they didn't bring closely associated string quartet Amiina, a horn section, or a choir, or anything that lumped them into the ""prog"" category outside of song lengths that regularly top eight minutes. But the lack of literal bells and whistles could've been more out of convenience than a desire to make any sort of artistic point. Thanks to Jónsi's impeccable vocals, a rare falsetto that loses none of its power in a live setting, everything remains indubitably the work of Sigur Rós. Peeling off a few brassy layers isn't going to reveal any sort of true pop songcraft that you might've missed. Likewise, Inni will only be disappointing if you consider a live version as the de facto ""real version"" due to some strict concept of authenticity-- turns out that knowing when and how to employ a horn section is a skill and one the band excels at, so it's understandable that ""Ný Batterí"" and ""Hoppípola"" don't max out quite as volcanically as they do on record.  And if we're being honest, do we really want their back catalog to be humanized? I've always enjoyed ""Med Blódnasir"" as the three rapturous minutes where Sigur Rós thought they were a shoegaze band, but does hearing it sped up to a near punk-rock velocity, flubbed bass notes and all, add any real value? And while a gorgeous, dew-drop piano ballad on its own accord, ""All Alright"" doesn't definitively answer whether Ágætis Byrjun would be every bit as cherished had it been in English, or any identifiable language for that matter. But this format does establish commonality between the five studio albums Inni draws from and makes the sequencing and pacing spot-on. This isn't easy to do since none of them really do a good job in terms of substituting for each other. Still, they heavily favor the material that came after 2005's Takk, a crucial pivot where Sigur Rós started to be slotted into what might be considered ""conventional"" songwriting, or at least transcendence doled out more succinctly and frequently. Even when removed from its amniotic cocoon, ""Svefn-G-Englar"" moves tectonically, its cathartic, minor key rupture lasting about 20 seconds on a track that's got 10 more minutes. Fast forward five years, and ""Hoppípola"" sounds like the most anthemic part of Snow Patrol's ""Run"" isolated for reproduction in a Petri dish, while ""Vid Spilum Endalaust"" could pass for one of the most instantly catchy songs from either Mew or Muse. Still, even if Sigur Rós do plan on picking back up, Inni rewards those ruthlessly evaluating it based on whether it's a legit substitute for the real thing. Its purchase price is within the range of a face-value concert ticket, but the truth is, I find no reason to begrudge anyone who'd prefer Inni, much like I don't hold it against people who'd rather watch an NFL game in the comfort of their own home, considering the ratio of awe-inspiring catharsis to buildup. After all, the 15 minutes of ""Popplagid"" (aka ""Untitled 8"") are an investment when you've elected to consume *( ) *in its entirety, but here you have to evaluate whether it's worth taking up space that more viscerally satisfying songs like ""Gobbledigook"" or ""Gong"" could've filled.  Practically anyone can admit that two consecutive hours of Sigur Rós is a lot to take in, and if you need to take a bathroom break or check your Fantasy Football lineup after ""E-Bow"" closes out the first disc, there's no shame in that. After all, if the point of Inni is to prove that Sigur Rós are human, why can't we be given the same luxury in their presence?","Taken from the Icelandic band's final show in London before their recently revoked indefinite hiatus, Inni contains two-plus hours of music spread across a 2xCD/DVD.

Carbon-Based Anatomy EP,Cynic,by: Hank Shteamer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22b9d034d5c69bf4b1e/1:1/w_160/97db34eb.jpeg,2011-11-15 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/,Season of Mist,"Think of Cynic as an expatriate from the land of extreme metal. As with other restless-spirit heavy outfits from Nachtmystium to Mastodon, you can still detect an original accent in the work of this L.A.-via-Miami band; but at this stage, they're speaking a whole other language-- call it pop-savvy prog. And on Carbon-Based Anatomy, Cynic's second EP since an outstanding 2008 reunion full-length, Traced in Air, they're communicating with remarkable fluency. Cynic's roots stretch back to the fertile early-1990s Florida death-metal scene. Before issuing their own proper debut, the band's co-leaders, guitarist-vocalist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert, scored a high-profile freelance gig, backing Death leader Chuck Schuldiner on Human. The concise title of that 1991 classic belies its groundbreaking blend of ferocity and technicality-- not to mention its inescapable influence on the next two decades of chops-happy extreme metal. (A great-sounding reissue is out on Relapse if you're curious.) The pair quickly jumped ship, though, and got to work on its own definitive statement, 1993's rich, puzzling Focus. Even on this first LP, Cynic seemed to regard metal like a vestigial tail. Guest vocalist Tony Teegarden contributed anguished, growling vocals that recalled Schuldiner's, but Masvidal augmented his lines with a pre-Auto-Tune robot speak. And while the band indulged in outbursts of hard-hitting shred, they avoided death metal's signature blastbeats outright, favoring supple rhythms drawn straight from the jazz-fusion playbook. If Focus had an ugly-duckling appeal, Cynic's hybrid experiment didn't pay off fully until Traced in Air, which followed a 15-year hiatus. The comeback effort pushed metal even further into the background in favor of an increased melodicism; suddenly Cynic seemed like a new standard bearer for 21st-century art rock, flooring you with their technicality while mashing on all your bliss buttons. The record took what it needed from extreme metal (growled backing vocals), fusion (tricky turnarounds and ornate solos), and pop (open-hearted hooks). This was a band unmoored from genre but not adrift: The songs were pointing the way, rather than any regard for a clearly definable style. Underscoring that point, the band followed Traced in Air with 2010's Re-Traced, an EP that adapted four of the full-length's tunes in a calmer style, with the metal-- and, for the most part, rock-- siphoned out in favor of folky pop and electronica. It was a startling move, but the material held up. Carbon-Based Anatomy, consisting of all-new material, is more substantial than Re-Traced, the next best thing to a new LP. A 23-minute suite of six continuous tracks, the EP restores the band's aggressive side but only in measured doses. The three proper songs here-- presented along with a trio of soundscapey mood setters-- are easily Cynic's most accessible to date, favoring straightforward verse-chorus anthems and ditching the death-metal-styled vocals outright. Yet they're also some of the band's strongest, further proof that Masvidal and Reinert's core ideas are sturdy enough to withstand drastic shifts in style. The title track is a perfectly paced stunner. A sensuous, tribal-y verse (which finds Reinert locking in with Focus-era Cynic bassist Sean Malone, who guests on the EP) alternates with a placid guitar-and-voice passage, mapping out the piece's sing-songy motifs. After a dreamy fusion interlude, the aggression ramps up: Masvidal solos triumphantly, and the band kicks into a stomping, crunchy climax, over which Masvidal recasts the earlier guitar-voice melody as a yearning anthem. Usually not one to present his vocals undisguised, he sings sans effects here and achieves a new emotional directness. The track lasts more than six minutes, but it feels trim, even radio-ready. It's fitting that Masvidal sings about transcending the body (""Drop the knife/ Leave your arms behind/ Just for a moment""); on a piece like this, Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song. Carbon-Based Anatomy might be relatively conventional, but thanks to Masvidal and Reinert's idiosyncratic virtuosity, it doesn't come off as bland. Masvidal shines on the EP's two other core tracks, ""Box Up My Bones"" and ""Elves Beam Out"". On the former-- like the title track, a catchy, profoundly dynamic mini opus-- the guitarist whooshes in during a mid-song breather, playing a gorgeous series of notey trills and demonstrating how he's re-purposed his metal-honed chops in the service of pure textural beauty. In ""Elves Beam Out"", a strange, dazzling little song, he connects the dots between John Lennon and Yes' Steve Howe, moving from gloomy, ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)""-style riffage to feverishly grandiose filigree. Throughout the release, Reinert deftly balances ornament with groove. On the ""Carbon-Based Anatomy"" verse, he peppers his beat with a flurry of tasty tom and snare accents, while on the ""Elves Beam Out"" chorus, he blends brisk bass-drum stutters and half-time cymbal accents into an infectious stop-start pattern. Carbon-Based Anatomy's three remaining tracks-- bookends ""Amidst the Goals"" and ""Hieroglyph"", which feature chanting and narration from singer-songwriter Amy Correia, and mid-EP breather ""Bija!""-- set aside chops in favor of atmosphere. (James Cameron's sci-fi-meets-New Age mysticism is an apt reference point for the moods these pieces conjure.) Unlike the songs that sit next to them, this material depends entirely on context. Listen to the release front-to-back, and they function as respectable palate cleansers and thematic signposts; but consider them individually, especially the tablas-and-chanting-heavy ""Bija!,"" and they scan as too mundane, paling next to the ecstatically inventive material that surrounds them. To be fair, Cynic has skirted this line since Focus, which wasn't without its over-the-top moments; there, as with Carbon-Based Anatomy, though, the quality of the surrounding songs is too high for it to matter much. Lofty as it is, the text Correia speaks in ""Hieroglyph"" resonates strongly with Cynic's creative ambitions. She tells of a soul who's been ""blown to all corners of the universe… his whole being an explosion into infinity."" When she observes, ""No walls/ No specific personality,"" it's hard not to think of Masvidal and Reinert's fearless two-decade-plus quest to evolve, their willingness to cast off metal-oriented trappings that no longer suited their compositional needs. For a band that's come this far, maybe a metaphor involving the transgalactic dispersion of the soul really is appropriate. When you're functioning at as high a level as 2011-model Cynic, you're entitled to a bit of grandiosity.","With roots stretching to the early-1990s Florida death-metal scene, Cynic have since pushed metal into the background. Favoring straightforward verse-chorus structures, anthemic motifs, and textural beauty, this 23-minute suite, ditches death-metal-styled vocals outright.

Black Square,BNJMN,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ddb1335d7bf169a354/1:1/w_160/12ff45f2.jpeg,2011-11-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15986-black-square/,Rush Hour,"When Bournemouth, UK-based producer BNJMN burst onto the scene with ""Blocks"" last year, its beauty was as tantalizing as the lack of details surrounding its release. It came out on an Amsterdam-only 12"" with little clue as to ""BNJMN""'s identity. What we did have to go on was the gorgeous music carved into those grooves: All woozy arpeggios and fuzzy chiming chords, the track felt both majestically modern yet mournfully nostalgic, a lost artifact worn as much by time as by digital filters. It was an odd fit for a label known best for its comprehensive house reissue series, but Benjamin Thomas' debut album, Plastic World, revealed how deep ""Blocks""'s nostalgia went. Plastic World, an album mixing soft-focus IDM introspection with the ongoing house and hip-hop flirtations of so much contemporary ""bass music,"" more than lived up to the promise of ""Blocks"". Thomas' formula felt more natural than most. What was also striking about BNJMN was not just that he nailed his reference points (ambient and bleep techno, early Warp Records), but that he had little disregard for what was going on around him aside from what he could and lift and mould to his own specifications. Even when he was playing with familiar structures-- sometimes he sounded like Teebs, other times he sounded like early Autechre-- there was something wonderfully private about it all, as if he were coming at these ideas from behind some impenetrable screen of idiosyncrasy. It was a 40-minute album that easily swelled beyond its own meager confines, a spontaneous overflow of engaging musical ideas that managed to carve a palpable pocket into an overcrowded scene even as it stared in from the borderlands. Released bewilderingly quickly-- only eight months after its predecessor-- Black Square finds its own success in the reduction of nearly everything that made Plastic World so appealing. Much like the bare cover art, the music methodically removes the extraneous elements from Thomas' deliberately blurry sound and leaves every cog in the machine starkly visible. Even in a realm where repetition is the rule, there's something about Thomas' work that can feel especially rigid: On Plastic World it was a smearing effect that created a dreamy swirl; on Black Square we feel all the ugly edges and jagged rims. The mechanic has a lot in common with producers currently experimenting with footwork forms and other uptempo musics: Take ""Keep the Power Out"", where a harshly chopped vocal phrase and persistently ticking rimshot fashion a symphony of frantic monotony. The effect is still as hypnotic and engrossing as ever, but this time it feels more tactile and real, easier to grasp in its dressed-down guise. It's this new naked physicality that makes Black Square an even more exciting prospect than past work. Thomas wields the kick drum like a mighty weapon, and the way the record moves from the wooden clack of ""Primal Pathways"" to its midpoint climax of ""Open the Floodgates"" is spectacular. We're given hints with the pulse underneath tracks like the whimsical ""Wisdom of Uncertainty"" and the Velvet Underground-sampling title track, but when that simple kick drops a minute into ""Floodgates"", it's the weight of the real world, the weight of true dance music crashing into BNJMN's cultivated electronica fantasies. It's a formidable strike that highlights texture as Black Square's most important element: The tracks thereafter feel like a hangover from the relative abandon of ""Floodgates"", but they're rich and sensual. The dulcet tones, flinty synths, and buoyant guitars of ""Lava"" are an aural feast, and closer ""Hallowed Road"" is a teasingly sparse disintegration that unwinds the album through resonance and hum-and-buzz, the undoing of the bubbly melodies that were the erstwhile dominant force in Thomas' compositions. Black Square is definitely not a retread of Plastic World, but it's not the predictable expand-and-improve sophomore effort either. It's a brave sort of refinement that brings what was special about Plastic World into even finer relief: Brimming with opposing currents, from nostalgia to fantasy to decadence and dread, Black Square is not the simple world it appears to be at first, yet it's simple enough to digest. At 32 minutes, it makes a heavier indent than its lengthier sibling and is a more assured statement than most dance albums. It doesn't matter that it comes on one of house music's most lauded archival labels, because BNJMN's music is timeless, and it belongs on an imprint known for securing dance music history rather than one focused on its trendy and fickle future.","Removing all extraneous elements from his deliberately blurry sound, UK dance producer Benjamin Thomas showcases a naked physicality on his second album, a collection that comes only eight months after its predecessor.

He routinely stresses love, understanding, and the violent overthrow of government-- a peace-seeking yogi who will slap the shit out of you for talking reckless. Some things are not supposed to be logical. Based in ""the Mojave,"" the desert-dwelling prophet dropped The 9th Inning EP last month. We owe the free, four-song collection's existence to an arrangement between Sufi and viral video/mixtape portal, Hydroshare. He gets paid for old tracks that had been infecting his hard drives since being first recorded several years ago. We get new music to hold us over until his mini-album MU.ZZ.LE drops in January. From the first words of The 9th Inning, we're sucked into apocalypse. Industrial noises clank like robots led to the guillotine. John Carpenter synths ooze and ""Demonchild"" starts with Sufi croaking, ""My mama says son/ Look what the world's coming to/ My mama was right/ The sun is colored blue."" What makes Gonjasufi's music so singular is that voice, suspended somewhere between George Clinton, Tom Waits, and something that crawled out of the La Brea Tar Pits-- prehistoric and warped from thousands of pounds of pressure. ""Eat Fish"" finds Ecks hanging ectoplasmic hooks on boom-bap drums and raps from L.A. left-fielder Blu. The chorus' moral: ""be rich, eat fish, and die."" It's sage advice partially cribbed from the Wu-Tang Clan's Ghostface Killah, and indeed, the spirit of Wu-Tang hangs heavy over this project. With its stripped down organ loops and dusted drums, ""The Lows"", sounds like a distant cousin to Gravediggaz and Tricky's The Hell EP. Opting to spit his tiger style raps, Sufi channels the unhinged delirium of Ol' Dirty Bastard. There are cold-blooded threats of ""wandering eyes getting poked"" and the difficulties of keeping oaths not to kill when there are ""vampires walking around with smiles on their grill."" Lest you think there is a clear father to his style, he calls on ""savasana"" for calm-- the corpse pose in yoga. Nor can you define the title track. It's not quite rap, and even though it's partially sung, it's light years from R&B. Disembodied vocals coo in the background, and Sufi sounds like someone who attempted to conjure Nate Dogg at a séance and received a demented ghost from a nearby dimension. It's unclear whether he's singing or rapping, and that's the point. It's otherworldly and unclassifiable. Or as he chants about a former partner, ""similarities in our style, but I took it from here. I took it from here."" Enter the demon.","The 32-year old ex-underground MC Sumach Ecks splits the difference between Western aggression, Eastern mysticism, and extraterrestrial idiosyncrasy. This free four-song EP is as unclassifiable as the rest of his material.

Cold Day in Hell,Freddie Gibbs,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2145e6ef95969322229/1:1/w_160/dc614464.jpeg,2011-11-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16024-freddie-gibbs-cold-day-in-hell/,LRG,"Freddie Gibbs' latest mixtape, Cold Day in Hell, leaked during a 48-hour-period in which new hip-hop tapes were dropping every five minutes. More than a few of these artists were capitalizing off the hype that surrounded A$AP Rocky's debut record LiveLoveA$AP, a release the internet noise machine took up as its latest cause. Freddie Gibbs may remember that honeymoon period well; a couple of years back, he was the focus of this ruthless media blitz, an artist who rocketed suddenly from major-label reject to being mentioned in The New Yorker. It was an odd position for a rapper whose persona often felt like a simple amalgamation of 1990s Rap-A-Lot records. One of the unfortunate things about this hype cycle is its obsession with novelty at the expense of quality; Gibbs isn't a new artist any more, but Cold Day in Hell is arguably his most well-rounded, accomplished offering. It isn't that he's improved as a rapper, but as an artist. He has recognized his weaknesses and produced a lush, versatile record that works around them. Gibbs, as a performer, has always been a skilled technician, but in the backlash that followed his early acclaim, some pointed out that his rapping could be dry and impersonal. In impressing folks caught up in the theatrical onslaught of his driving delivery, it was easy for fans to miss the big picture. At his weakest, he is a technician first and a conversationalist second. For his core fanbase, this is the appeal: gangster rap with brutality and self-control the primary goal. These shortcomings become evident, though, when you compare Gibbs to a rapper like Young Jeezy, whose economy, directness, and charisma burst through the speakers on a track like ""Twos and Fews"". But what Gibbs has accomplished on Cold Day in Hell is a challenge to the reliable audience that would prefer him in autopilot mode, and it actually gives his music a lot more replay value. As on his strongest releases, he uses a variety of strategies that value musicality above all. A major contributor to Gibbs' success here is producer Cardo. His beats have an ethereal, Clams Casino-lite quality, although Cardo works in a more mercenary, less brand-conscious context. There are also more than enough R&B hooks here to scare away the one-note Gibbs fan. These tracks actually introduce a tension and excitement into Gibbs' work that is often missed when he's worked with typical boom-bap production. The perfect example is album highlight ""B.A.N.ned"". Cardo's chopped-up vocal loop infuses the tracks with a haunting melancholy, framing Gibbs' vocals-- always taut with aggression-- with a strong emotional undercurrent. But it's not a one-way transaction; Gibbs' dark story rap on ""My Homeboy's Girlfriend"" is a disquieting factor that charges Cardo's evocative Sade sample. Gibbs' voice is monotone, but it gains a stark power when the music that surrounds it lunges for an emotional jugular. The record's diverse sound shows a wider range of influences than previous releases. SMKA's beat for the Juicy J-featuring ""Str8 Slammin'"" is a sparkling imitation of the kind of moody arpeggios the Hypnotized Minds camp pioneered a decade ago. Cardo's ""Menace II Society"" is such a pitch-perfect spiritual son of California's gangster rap peak that you'll be pulling out your Celly Cel tapes (or running to RapidShare). One of the album's best moments is ""Anything to Survive"", which samples Bobbi Humphrey's ""Harlem River Drive"" and includes verses from Freeway and underrated Chicago rapper Sly Polaroid. What unites these disparate archetypes is Gibbs himself. What once seemed like a limitation-- the straightforward affect of his rapping-- now serves to balance some riskier, prettier experiments. His dimension and focus here should give pause to those who've discounted him.","The Indiana rapper's newest mixtape is arguably his most well-rounded, accomplished offering. He's recognized his weaknesses and produced a lush, versatile record that works around them.

"Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage: 1982-2011",R.E.M.,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b228c0084474cd0c1f15/1:1/w_160/245d4e5c.jpeg,2011-11-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16032-part-lies-part-heart-part-truth-part-garbage-1982-2011/,Warner Bros.IRS,"R.E.M. spent the majority of their 31-year career putting out top-quality albums, while a chunk of their audience wished they would just break up already. Though some of this was a bit reactionary and a by-product of their roots in the nascent indie rock scene of the 1980s, it was mainly a consequence of one of the band's most admirable qualities-- a restless desire to reinvent themselves with each record and create a discography in which each new entry had a distinct character. This much was clear by 1984: R.E.M. could have mined indefinitely the fascinating blend of murky atmosphere and crystal clear chiming guitar parts on their debut, Murmur-- lord knows many other bands of the era tried-- but they took a left turn into the sunnier, more lyrically direct Reckoning and kept throwing curveballs at their audience from that point onward. This tendency yielded a rich body of work spanning 15 studio albums, but the creative shifts-- however organic they may seem in context-- gave listeners valid reasons to jump ship along the way. It makes just as much sense to enjoy all their records as it does for someone who favors Peter Buck's early jangle-centric guitar style to recoil at his flamboyantly distorted tone on Monster, or for fans of their immensely popular chamber pop records Out of Time and Automatic for the People to shrug off the skewed, highly politicized arena rock of their late 80s records. This isn't even factoring in the uneven albums they made following the departure of original drummer and songwriter Bill Berry, which spanned from the tentative lounge pop of Up to the often dreary melodrama of Around the Sun and the ""back to basics"" rock of Accelerate. With this in mind, Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage: 1982-2011-- the band's first career-spanning anthology-- does an exceptional job of presenting this body of work as a chronological survey that neatly summarizes their major themes and artistic tangents while being highly listenable. The song selection is exceptional-- a few relatively minor singles didn't make the cut, but every major hit is here, presented alongside crucial album tracks such as ""Country Feedback"", ""Begin the Begin"", and ""Life and How to Live It"". The quality of the material up through at least the middle of the second disc is unimpeachable; the sheer concentration of classic tunes makes a strong case for the band ranking among the 20th century's greatest songwriting partnerships. The set handles the band's leaner years with grace and minimal revisionism, though the electronic and ambient textures of Up are sidelined in favor of that album's delicate Beach Boys homage ""At My Most Beautiful"". A few wild card selections from their more recent records, such as Accelerate's ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"" and ""Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter"" from Collapse Into Now, shine in this context. Nearly every hits set must include previously unreleased material, and this one is no different. The three new tracks featured here are the final completed songs of the band's career and serve as a coda of sorts for their recorded output. The single ""We All Go Back to Where We Belong"" is the keeper; a wistful ballad with a delightfully schmaltzy Burt Bacharach-like arrangement that barely conceals its subtext of basically being about the end of R.E.M. The other two cuts sound like a band crossing a few ideas off their bucket list before calling it a day: ""Hallelujah"" comes off like them giving one last attempt at nailing the hazy sophisti-pop they explored on Reveal, while the dreadful ""A Month of Saturdays"" meets the title's ""garbage"" requirement by sounding as though they realized at the last moment that they never wrote a song about loving the weekend and scrambled to remedy that with only a few minutes of studio time. Though R.E.M.'s dissolution is not necessarily a cause for celebration, having a clearly defined end point makes it much easier to grasp the scope of their achievements. Part of a collective anxiety about R.E.M.'s ongoing existence up until this year was based in a desire on the part of the audience to impose a manageable narrative on their career. Now that they have disbanded, it's much easier to understand the trajectory of their post-Berry output in particular: Basically, they spent some time in the 2000s trying out new sounds and ways of working, but they eventually reconnected with their rock'n'roll roots before wrapping up their career with Collapse Into Now, a set of songs that revisited their creative strengths. Those records are never going to as beloved as their first 10 brilliant and remarkably consistent albums with Berry, but Part Lies makes a good case that their later period has value too, and that the group had raised the bar so high for themselves that merely being very good could be interpreted as a failure.","This highly listenable, career-spanning anthology-- featuring three previously unreleased tracks-- does an exceptional job of presenting R.E.M.'s 31 years as a chronological survey that neatly summarizes their major themes and artistic tangents.

"True Traitor, True Whore",Leviathan,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22cea9e61561daa68b1/1:1/w_160/81e26ae0.jpeg,2011-11-14 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16035-true-traitor-true-whore/,Profound Lore,"On the morning of Sunday, January 9, the tattoo artist Jef Whitehead was arrested in Chicago on charges of sexual assault and domestic violence. According to the Chicago Tribune, Whitehead-- a specialist in colorful and morbid depictions of demons and reapers-- was working as a guest at Taylor Street Tattoo following an international inking tour. After midnight, he got in a fight with his girlfriend and, as a Tribune reporter wrote, allegedly ""used the tools of his trade to sexually assault his girlfriend after he slammed her head against a floor and choked her."" Whitehead posted bail and, 10 months later, has yet to go to trial. For more than a decade, Whitehead, under the name Wrest, has been pressing the bounds of black metal, adding psychedelic textures and hints of mid-tempo punk to fairly brutal marathons. By himself as Leviathan and the great Lurker of Chalice, and with the misfiring supergroup Twilight, Whitehead made weird, unexpected moves within United States Black Metal long before the form broke into indie rock circles or The New Yorker's pages. He's long been heavy on horror and violence, too, with song titles like ""A Bouquet of Blood for Skull"", ""I Miss Watching You Die"" and, notably, ""The History of Rape"". He often wrote and spoke of suicide and, in 2004, told an interviewer that being alive at least allowed him ""to voice anti-human disgust."" Still, his arrest was surprising and a big deal; for the last 10 months, questions about him have become boilerplate in extreme metal interviews. The inevitable summary of Whitehead's January arrest isn't meant to romanticize the actions of the occasionally violent black metal scene, or to give him the Burzum-sized brand of black metal authenticity. It's not meant to scorn Whitehead, either, as he has yet to be convicted of anything. Rather, as Whitehead admitted in a rare interview with Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy in September, the incident and subsequent fallout served as the inspiration for his most recent album, the unashamedly titled True Traitor, True Whore. ""The true harlot has been revealed,” Whitehead wrote in the email interview. ""[True Traitor, True Whore] is most definitely an expression of what I've been thru in the past year... Everyone's met one by now, I'd imagine-- not too cryptic."" At the risk of sounding dismissive, True Traitor, True Whore sounds like the work of a one-time innovator who's since been preoccupied. Sure, as on with almost all Whitehead releases, the multi-instrumentalist starts from a rigorous base of black metal and floods that sound with extrinsic influences. ""True Whorror"" sprints with a near-grindcore jolt, while ""Shed This Skin"" intersperses black-metal blurs with moments of funeral doom and glimpses of thrash heroics. On ""Harlot Rises"", an acoustic-guitar breakdown clashes with sound effects that mimic industrial 1980s drums. There are drones and noise, post-rock climbs, and smoldering comedowns, too. But True Traitor often circles back or collapses on itself, with many of these eight songs eventually devolving at various points into messy psychedelic maelstroms that, compositionally, Whitehead doesn't seem good enough to redirect. On ""Contrary Pulse"", he builds tension by slowing the song's tempo, allowing its more aggressive elements to claw against its dirge-like undercarriage. It's an intriguing setup, but he never capitalizes on that unease, eventually letting the song escape into a web of meandering guitar. What starts with a roar ends, then, with an unsatisfying whimper. Leviathan's best work has been about pushing momentum from one extreme to another; on True Traitor, that sense of movement is generally squandered, as Whitehead struggles and frequently fails to make his many strains of interest cohere. What's more, for a sub-genre that's not only itself full of interesting ideas but that's also recently spawned compelling sounds in other niches, True Traitor feels redundant. Leviathan has done brutal black metal better than this (see 2006's too-brief The Blind Wound), and he's previously been much more convincing when tying that ferocity to outside sounds (see 2008's great Massive Conspiracy Against All Life). At various points here, Whitehead sounds like a less developed Locrian, a smaller Wolves in the Throne Room or a less intricate Absu. Thematically, True Traitor, True Whore is a work of pure juvenilia, comprised of songs with puns for titles that would be more understandable coming from the pen of a pimply 13-year-old boy aggravated by the rage of puberty. There's opener ""True Whorror"", the chaser ""Her Circle Is the Noose"", and the mid-album ""Every Orifice Yawning Her Price"". Not only are those titles ripe for parody (and prosecutors), but they're also repetitive, another symptom of the unimaginative core at work throughout Traitor. Leviathan's 2004 album, Tentacles of Whorror, already cashed in on a lot of these jokes; it was a much better album, too. Since January, some critics and listeners have advocated for a yimakh shemo approach to Whitehead, meaning that-- if the charges against him are true-- his work should be ignored, his musical legacy ruined by the deplorable thing he might have done. Without Wrest, though, it's impossible to imagine black metal's current stateside currency or creativity. He's made some remarkable records that have rightfully had a widespread effect on many of the bands that followed him. True Traitor, True Whore isn't ultimately dismissible because of what Whitehead allegedly did in January; rather, it is dismissible because it does not improve what he certainly did for the decade-plus prior, which was to help map new territory in a field that has since raced forward independently-- and ahead, it seems-- of him.","For more than a decade, Jef Whitehead has been pressing the bounds of black metal. His new album-- inspired by his arrest on sexual assault and domestic violence charges earlier this year-- doesn't stand up to his more innovative earlier work.

Pan Am Stories,Rangers,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2269d034d5c69bf4b17/1:1/w_160/24367aa9.jpeg,2011-11-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16028-pan-am-stories/,Not Not Fun,"Rangers' 2010 album Suburban Tours brought to mind alienated youthful evenings spent in identikit housing, so cut adrift from the world that the only place to escape was deep into your own head. Skip forward a year, and we have Pan Am Stories, an album title that's superficially linked to the process of escape, tied into a company that went bankrupt after misjudging the flux in demand to get away from it all. Rangers is a solo project conducted by the San Francisco-based Texas transplant Joe Knight, who put out a flurry of cassette-only releases on As Above So Below and his current label Not Not Fun toward the end of the last decade. Suburban Tours was a surprisingly concise effort after the freeform sprawl of those releases, but the central Rangers sound-- dense layers of fudgy guitar melancholia engulfed by acres of tape dust-- remained intact. On Pan Am Stories, Knight attempts to build a better link between his past and present selves, retaining some of the expansiveness of earlier Rangers releases and stacking them up against exercises in cropped lo-fi pop. It's a double album, with many tracks stretching well over the four-minute mark, and a focal point in ""Zeke's Dream"" that runs to 13-and-a-half minutes. That song, like most of the others here, is marked by a strangulated guitar tone reminiscent of the heavily processed work Jonathan Donahue and Grasshopper were dabbling in on Mercury Rev's Yerself Is Steam. Like that band, Knight appears obsessively occupied with severing open altered states of consciousness through his music. ""Zeke's Dream"" feels like several different songs all pushing one another out of the picture, with the feverish playing cascading through basic riffing, rippling solos, and even some Tangerine Dream-like keyboard drones. It's no surprise, then, that a search for Rangers throws up a story of people tripping balls to the ever-unfolding Low Cut Fades cassette while driving through the desert. That tale seems particularly appropriate when you consider Knight's fascination with travel, where the mode of getting somewhere appears more attractive than the final destination. In a sense, that's how Rangers' most expansive music plays out too. ""The Mule"", at the back end of this album, is a loosely woven ballad that ebbs and flows as keyboard noise and fat guitar excess is worked in. Despite those elements, it never deviates from its central riff, which coils over and over, locked down in a journey with no particular goal in mind. Even at its most tuneful, on tracks like the poppy and more tightly structured ""Luncheon Ghana"", there's a sense that these songs are fragments of works that could easily be pushed out into ""Zeke's Dream""-sized spaces. What makes Pan Am Stories worth returning to is the scope Knight works within, where elements of prog, folk, and psychedelia blur in and out of focus, often mirroring the superior work Bristol explorers Flying Saucer Attack were practicing in the 1990s. At times it does lag, especially when the buried-in-the-sand vocal exercises on tracks like ""Khyber Pass"" and ""Sacred Cows"" don't add much to the overall picture. But it feels like Knight is finding his confidence as a singer here, perhaps prepping to step out of the dimly lit corner he was sporadically crooning into during the making of this record. In particular, the twinned ""Zombies (Day)"" and ""Zombies (Night)"" are among his most fully formed pop efforts yet, indicating that his music can be as much about design and execution as it is about voyage and discovery.","The solo project led by the San Francisco-based Texas transplant Joe Knight returns with a sprawling double album that blurs together elements of prog, folk, and psychedelia.

Fuck Death,Blackout Beach,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b225ea9e61561daa68ab/1:1/w_160/8dc51a71.jpeg,2011-11-14 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16029-blackout-beach-fuck-death/,Dead Oceans,"There's a common misconception that you need CliffsNotes, or perhaps a Ph.D. in Carey Mercer, to enjoy a Frog Eyes record. This is because a Frog Eyes record often sounds like a Shaksepearean play on amphetamines, pummeling you at a frenzied pace with wordplay, allusions, and vaguely familiar proper nouns. You might also need a stomach for the macabre: Frontman Mercer often shrieks like someone being burnt at the stake, the soundscapes around him melting into a hallucinatory drip. It's true that Mercer's music is demanding and dense (along with his Swan Lake cohorts Spencer Krug and Dan Bejar, he seems perennially intent on treating the album like an epic poem), but there are also plenty of thrills on the surface. Somewhere in the last Frog Eyes album, Paul's Tomb: A Triumph, there was a knotty narrative of violence, guilt, and redemption, but-- check the soaring, firecracker riffs on ""Styled By Dr. Roberts"" and ""Lear in Love""-- it was also a hell of a guitar record. (There's even something morbid about his choice of gear: Mercer got the guitar tone on that record by using old, dying amps.) Similarly, Skin of Evil, the second proper record from his solo project, Blackout Beach, was full of luxuriant texture. Even the lyrics themselves possessed a phonetic beauty. Who is Donna, the elusive muse who haunted Skin of Evil? An obscure goddess from a test you failed in high school English? No, Mercer's said he just likes the way the name sounds-- it reminds him of ""dawn."" So it is with Fuck Death: a record like any other, best listened to with the search engine browser closed and the encyclopedia left on the shelf. The story's there should you wish to untangle it, but don't let it distract you from the luminous atmosphere and synth experiments whose rewards lie much closer to the surface. ""Did you ever think of yourself as a runaway?"" Mercer murmured on an unusually hushed moment of Frog Eyes' clanging, 2007 opus Tears of the Valedictorian. Throughout his career, he's been preoccupied with themes of masculinity, cowardice, and destiny. How fast must a man run to outpace his own fate? Or, perhaps a better question, one he probably should have asked before he started running: Where can he go? Set during wartime, Fuck Death takes inspiration from soldiers' desertion to probe these dark themes. The pulse of hypnotic opener ""Beautiful Burning Desire"" beats, ""We got to run away/ Run run away/ Going to run away,"" while the corroding, industrial tones of ""Torchlights Banned"", featuring backing vocals from Frog Eyes keyboardist Megan Boddy, underscore the tenderness and urgency of a letter home: ""I'm going to be a while/ I'm in a fortress of flame/…And your love is all I shall stand for/ And I'm standing in the rain."" Unlike the more recent, guitar-heavy Frog Eyes records, the sound of Fuck Death mostly comes from intricately layered monophonic synths. In the middle of ""Beautiful Burning Desire"", they take on the ominous quality of air-raid sirens; on ""Torchlights Banned"" they are the commanding chop of helicopter blades; and perhaps most effectively, during the narrator's flight from his camp on ""Be Forewarned, the Night Has Come"", they give the impression of searchlights. On paper it probably seems too literal-- like avant-garde Foley art-- but the tones Mercer employs effectively create an atmosphere of chilly foreboding, and their luminous tones also provide a sonic link to the record's thematic preoccupation with light and darkness. Mercer generally throws so many ideas at you that you're left huffing and puffing with barely a moment to process it all, but Fuck Death is the first record of his that feels like a genuine meditation on the themes it explores. Instead of pummeling, it actually awards the listener with moments of pause, making its atmosphere that much more immersive. Throughout Fuck Death there's also Mercer's requisite musings about art and the artist (""You should be ashamed, Philistine,"" goes one ironic, spittle-filled taunt) on which you can faintly detect him grappling with his own persona-- obstinately refusing to go easy on us, to crack a smile, or to let in some light. It's this monochromatic darkness that ultimately makes it a less compelling record than his pal Bejar's 2011 offering Kaputt, and in particular its closing number, the irresistible, cagily autobiographical, 11-minute-roller-skate-jam-on-quaaludes ""Bay of Pigs"". ""Bay of Pigs"" is indulgent and artful, but it's also breezy and inviting, the kind of song you'd play for those who have previously dismissed Destroyer as being pretentious or an acquired taste in the hope that it might convert them. There are no such songs on Fuck Death, and so the Mercer camps will remain divided. His admirers will find this record beautiful in the strangest places, while his detractors might choose to see its occasional impenetrable gloom as a kind of desertion in itself: In the end, he's still running from us.","Taking inspiration from wartime and desertion, the Frog Eyes frontman's third solo album uses intricately layered synths to create an atmosphere of chilly foreboding. It's the first Carey Mercer record that feels like a genuine meditation on the themes it explores.

Bangs & Works Vol. 2,Various Artists,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b229b1335d7bf169a3be/1:1/w_160/ea884dd7.jpeg,2011-11-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16033-bangs-and-works-vol-2/,Planet Mu,"When the first Bangs & Works compilation was released by Planet Mu last year, it emerged in a climate of controversy and accusations surrounding its authenticity and propriety, with some seeing it as a document of a Chicago scene as viewed by certain UK electronic tastemakers. This time, however, the circumstances feel simpler: Footwork influences and references are the norm for a whole international world of ""bass music,"" and the questions of exploitation and gimmickry seem to have been put to rest, or at least pushed aside. Good timing, too-- the second Bangs & Works is a marked improvement over its predecessor; as if unconcerned with being comprehensively representative to outsiders, its curator, Mike Paradinas, can delve into the very depths of the sound's weirdness. Part of the reason that footwork proved so fascinating to so many different sectors of dance music simultaneously was its unforgiving extremity: Sonically rough and rhythmically brutal, it laced together latent impulses from jungle, breakcore, and house into something that sounded like mutant hip-hop-- booty house gone berserk. Compatible with so many universes yet still alien enough to be ineffably hip, it was the outsider of music of 2010 that stubbornly fought its way into the conversation. Hip-hop and R&B samples were the theme of the first Bangs & Works, emphasizing the Chicago scene's connection to and identification with hip-hop culture, but the focus on the second has changed. Instead of the staccato vocal clipping and syllabic repetition, you're more likely to hear swerving synths or pounding drums on Bangs & Works 2, a document of the scene that emphasizes its house roots. The first track sets the mood appropriately: RP Boo's ""Heavy Heat"" is a stormer of sub-bass and grim horn stabs, nary a vocal to be found outside of Boo's own producer tag drops (a common sound on Bangs & Works 2). There are still tracks with vocals-- rapping on DJ Earl's ""Hit Da Bootz"", chipmunk crooning on DJ Solo's ""What Have You Done"", hype-man hypnosis on DJ Roc's ""Get Buck Juice""-- but they're the exceptions. Instead we get the lush synth-funk of DJ Rashad & Gant-Man's ""Heaven Sent"" or the pendulous insanity of DJ T-Why's ear-piercing ""Finished"". That same producer's ""Juice"" and tracks from DJ Metro like ""Smak My Bitch Up"" show how dissociative and trippy footwork can be without sacrificing its crucial danceability-- not that it was ever easy to dance to in the first place. It's two new-- to Mu, anyway-- producers who run with that weirdness, standing out on the compilation's most progressive moments. Young Smoke provides vivid psychodrama with his string of lush tracks at the compilation's end, like the sparse funk of ""Space Muzik Pt. 3"", not too far from a Pearson Sound production. But it's Jlin who steals the show early on with ""Erotic Heat"", all tremulous low-frequency throbs, cracking snares, and drum patterns that snake and writhe with unusual precision. So many footwork producers are content to let their tom-toms skate across a slippery surface of undulating sub-bass, but Jlin's are unusually tactile and exact, little miniature cascades unfolding separately at will. Sharing the same Mortal Kombat sample as DJ MC's ""Y Fall"" but utilizing it so much more effectively, Jlin proves what makes her particularly special with the swampy psychedelia of ""Asylum"", harboring some of the hardest and heaviest-hitting percussion of any footwork track released on Planet Mu to date. Jlin's tracks are captivating because she relocates footwork's focus, rendering those bass rumbles even more isolated as she scatters the percussion to far-flung corners of the stereo spectrum. Her tracks show not only footwork's room for experimentation but the raw power that shines through even its weirdest moments. Just like its older brother, Bangs & Works 2 is an exhausting listen, 80 minutes of intense syncopation spread over 26 dense nuggets. But whether it's the generally higher production values this time around or simply a more agreeable palette, the whole thing feels a little easier to swallow. It's hard not to jump from track to track getting excited with each producer that steps up to the plate, almost enough to override the sometimes slipshod feeling of compilations like these-- and with the newfound thematic coherence, hodgepodge isn't an issue. Paradinas' library of footwork tracks numbers well over 1,500, and he's done an admirable curatorial job of finding some common threads in a sea of cobbled-together mania.

Take Care,Drake,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22f13d197565213a719/1:1/w_160/67ce3bba.jpg,2011-11-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16039-take-care/,Cash MoneyYoung Money EntertainmentUniversal Republic,"In 1976, Marvin Gaye holed up in his Hollywood studio and began recording Here, My Dear, a brutally candid album-length dissection of his divorce from wife Anna Gordy. The soul great found beauty within the wreckage, and the album doubled as an emotional exorcism that pushed out pain, anger, regret, spite, vengeance. ""Memories haunt you all the time/ I will never leave your mind,"" he threatens on a song called ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"". Reviewing the album upon its release in 1978, critic Robert Christgau wrote, ""Because Gaye's self-involvement is so open and unmediated... it retains unusual documentary charm."" The same could be said of Drake, whose unrepentant navel-gazing and obsession with lost love reach new levels on his second proper LP, Take Care. Running with Gaye's ghost, Drake offers a profane update of his forebear's twisted heart: ""Fuck that nigga that you love so bad/ I know you still think about the times we had,"" he sings on the insidious hook of ""Marvins Room"", a song recorded in the same studio where Gaye originally exposed his own unedited thoughts more than three decades ago. In this age of reality television, 24-hour celebrity news, and second-to-second documentation-- where behind-the-scenes sagas mix with what's on screen and on record, creating an ever-morphing, ever-more-self-aware new normal-- Drake is an apt avatar. Naturally, he knows this, too. ""They take the greats from the past and compare us/ I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era,"" he contemplates on the album, ""In a time where it's recreation/ To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations."" We can thank Kanye West for legitimately kicking off this open-book hip-hop era, and it's increasingly apparent that Drake is the most engaging new rap star since Ye. While fame causes some to withdraw and cling to what little privacy they have left, this 25-year-old Canadian's penchant for poetic oversharing has only been emboldened by his success. When he's not making the most epic drunk-dial song in pop history with ""Marvins Room"", he's openly pleading with former flame Rihanna on the record's title track, or duetting with Twitter wife Nicki Minaj on ""Make Me Proud"" only to call out such publicity-baiting ""relationships"" two tracks later, where he raps, ""It look like we in love, but only on camera."" With its startlingly frank talk and endless heartbreak, Take Care often reads like a string of especially vulnerable-- and sometimes embarrassing-- Missed Connections. This time around, Drake has a better grasp on his own notoriety and the mind-fucks that come with it. While he expressed wonderfully wounded trepidations about his sudden rise on Thank Me Later, he's learning to embrace it more here. ""They say more money more problems, my nigga, don't believe it,"" he raps on closer ""The Ride"". ""I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading/ But I blew six million on myself, and I feel amazing."" And on ""HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)"", he all but gives away his hand, turning his sadness into strategy: ""What have I learned since getting richer?/ I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures."" And while he claims ""I think I like who I'm becoming"" on ""Crew Love""-- about as ringing an endorsement you'll get from a guy so bent on exposing his own disappointments-- he's still more interested in contradiction than triumph. Even when staring at a pair of unnatural breasts, he highlights the incision rather than the size: ""Brand new girl and she still growing/ Brand new titties, stitches still showing/ Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good/ I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good."" Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up. Thank Me Later banked on a sonic tableau that was slow and sensual and dark-- equal parts Aaliyah and the xx-- and Take Care takes that aesthetic to an even more rewarding place, spearheaded by Drake's go-to producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, who gets a writing and production credit on almost every song. While the bombastic style of producer Lex Luger's work with Rick Ross and Waka Flocka Flame threatened to turn the tide on Drake and 40's moody atmospherics last summer, the pair stick to their gut here and delve further into smooth piano and muffled drums, fully committed to the idea of doing more with less. This is sensuous music that breathes heavy somewhere between UGK's deep funk, quiet-storm 90s R&B, and James Blake-inspired minimalism. (Drake reportedly had a vinyl copy of Blake's debut LP on display in the studio while recording Take Care.) Its subtlety is a direct rebuke to the rash of in-the-red Eurotrance waveforms clogging up radio dials. Even the more upbeat tracks take pains not to rely on a simple thump. ""Take Care"" features Rihanna and a four-four beat, but the singer shows off her little-heard whispering delivery and the instrumental comes courtesy of the xx's Jamie xx, who nimbly tailors his remix of Gil Scott-Heron's ""I'll Take Care of You"" for the occasion. Drake's worked on his own technical abilities, too, and both his rapping and singing are better than ever here. Notably, he only brandishes the hashtag flow he quickly became famous (or infamous) for over the last few years, turning it into a knowing knock on copycats: ""Man, all of your flows bore me/ Paint drying."" And he breathlessly runs through the opening verse on the vicious ""HYFR"" at a speed that would likely garner respect from Busta Rhymes. And then there's ""Doing It Wrong"", a brilliant, barely there slow jam that borrows some lyrics from an unlikely source (Don ""American Pie"" McLean's twangy 1977 track ""The Wrong Thing to Do"") and features an unlikely guest in Stevie Wonder. Fitting the album's classy, unshowy demeanor, Wonder is tapped not to sing but play harmonica-- and uncharacteristically downcast harmonica at that-- for the track's crushing denouement. The song has Drake chronicling the conflicting emotions of a difficult breakup and giving us his finest singing to date. His words are simple, universal, true: ""We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together/ But we sure make it feel like we're together/ 'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else."" Elsewhere, André 3000 references Adele's unimpeachable ""Someone Like You"" in one of the album's many well-placed guest verses; ""Doing It Wrong"" deserves to follow that song as pop's next Great Heartbroken Ballad. The cover of Take Care shows its star sitting at a table, dejected and surrounded by gold, like a hip-hop Midas. Considering some of the money-doesn't-buy-you-happiness sentiments inside, the picture is apropos enough. But it's much too obvious to truly represent what Drake and his crew have done here. A better image would be the grainy, amateur photo he released with ""Marvins Room"" when he originally leaked it in June, which shows the rapper walking away from a group of private jets, his face obscured by a puff of smoke making its way up to an overcast sky. It lets his reality do the heavy lifting while Drake stands by, taking it all in.","With his penchant for poetic over-sharing, Drake is an apt avatar for the era of reality television and 24-hour self-documentation. Backed by lush and moody beats, Take Care finds him putting his talents to use on his strongest set of songs so far.

Collections 01,Teebs,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20913d197565213a6e4/1:1/w_160/922fc5fe.jpeg,2011-11-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16016-collections-01/,Brainfeeder,"L.A.-based artist Mtendere Mandowa has always stood out from the Brainfeeder pack of weirdo hip-hop producers: his beats are shrouded in dewy mist and subtropical condensation rather than the crunchy boom-bap of producers like Flying Lotus or Samiyam. The way he uses filters and closely clipped loops has the effect of a pleasantly smudged watercolor painting (much like those he designs himself), vague hints of otherwise implacable sounds rotating and repeating in a whimsical way. It's eminently accessible music, full of tiny ""eureka"" moments of subtle bliss, deft touches, and minuscule finishes so that even a two-minute sketch could feel like a whole world waiting to be dissected. Alas, it's probably that part of his sound that most works against Teebs: His debut album, Ardour, was probably one of the most pleasant things released from this particular sector last year, but it was easy for track after track of dense nature-scapes to blur together and to lose sight of Teebs' own fascinating personality in the grand scheme of faceless beauty. Part of the reason for that was Ardour's length-- at 18 tracks long, it was a hard album to digest without fatigue or boredom setting in, a record that could easily start to feel like style over substance. Whether it's a wise lesson learned or merely serendipity, Mandowa's quick successor is a 10-track, 30-minute affair and all the stronger for it. Collections 01, if you want to be nerdy about it, sits somewhere between an EP and a ""mini-album,"" but a surprisingly cohesive statement like this exists outside the need for nit-picky classification. Teebs himself describes Collections 01 as ""a side project or group of mine that just so happened to make the same exact music as I'm making now,"" and as bizarre a description as that is, given that the record features Rebekah Raff's harp and Brainfeeder-associated composer Austin Peralta, maybe it's justified. While the music on Collections is very identifiably Teebs, it's not merely 10 more tracks of Ardour. Whether it's the presence of collaborators with discrete roles, maturity, or merely a different headspace, the tracks here feel grounded and focused, with more to hold onto even at their most weightless.  The colorful, soft-focus smear is partly replaced with discrete space and  Take ""LSP"", with Peralta, a track that incorporates the same kind of meandering chimes and aquatic nature sounds as so many tracks on Ardour, but now it feels like every element has newfound purpose. On this record, dulcet keyboards paint silky melodies like brushstrokes, the drearily rustling beats are sewn into the fabric rather than tacked on, and tracks have real beginnings and endings rather than just floating by. Texturally, it's some of Mandowa's most gripping material yet, like the simultaneously slamming yet impossibly airy ""Pretty Polly"" or the queasily determined sub-basslines on closing duo ""Red Curbs Loop"" and ""Yellow More New"". It says something for the fleeting nature of Teebs' music that what, for most artists, would be a stop-gap release turns out to be an arresting career highlight. It might be a slight little package, but somehow it makes even more of an impact than its considerably larger sibling. Attractively structured, confident, and executed without the stoned daydreaming that defined Ardour, Collections marks a new high-water mark for a producer that was already eminently accessible. Even for those who aren't fans of the kind of rambling and tangential ADD music usually proffered by Brainfeeder, the little readjustment on Collections might be just enough to rope in former skeptics. Either way, his new record is another collection of effortlessly gorgeous ruminations on hip-hop expressed through thermal updrafts, babbling brooks, and cracking twigs: This time it just sounds like he knows his way around the forest a little better.","L.A.-based artist Mtendere Mandowa always stood out from the Brainfeeder pack of weirdo producers. Following his over-long 2010 debut, this ""mini album"" of effortlessly gorgeous hip-hop ruminations offers a surprisingly cohesive statement.

Empros,Russian Circles,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ffea9e61561daa686f/1:1/w_160/60f3205e.jpg,2011-11-11 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16009-empros/,Sargent House,"A balancing act on a cosmic scale, Empros-- the fourth LP from mostly instrumental Chicago trio Russian Circles-- marries light to dark, order to chaos. Empros swings from the exceedingly beautiful to the punishingly physical in seconds flat. Every note on Empros is its right place, every surface scraped-up just so; a recent Decibel writeup found bassist Brian Cook claiming he'd never make another record ""from the ground up"" like the meticulously constructed Empros. Shame, that; as on 2009's swarmed-with-strings Geneva, the expanse charted by the grandiose Empros is very vast indeed. Building on the strides they made on Geneva's adventurous first half, Russian Circles complicate the drift-and-build of most post-rock, injecting craggy climaxes, letting the low end take the lead. Highlight ""Mlàdek"" finds a rousing, almost Broken Social Scene-style guitar chug careening headlong into a patch of black metal-inspired ballast; the shift in tone's a bit jarring, but considering the disparity of styles at play, the transition's pretty flawless. Empros' best moments-- the snowdrift strings that blow across the end of ""Schiphol"" and into ""Atackla"", the patch cord static and drums that open ""Batu,"" the aforementioned ""Mlàdek"" assault-- find some little sliver of gorgeousness overwhelmed by some orbit-upsetting rumble from Cook or some out-from-nowhere turnaround from drummer Dave Turncrantz. Complexity for its own sake muddled the Circles' first few LPs a bit; Empros, like Geneva before it, is less prone to wriggle, more likely to lunge, each move bigger than its last. That increased compositional confidence gives each move they make that much more heft, songs charging eagerly towards their second acts, then dizzyingly doubling back. Still, with most of these tunes hinging around some staggeringly huge mid-song wallop, once you've traveled Empros' strangeways a few times, you'll start to see the landmarks coming from a few miles off. Bigger, stranger, and just plain heavier than any Circles disc before it, the first 35 minutes of Empros' empyrean, oblong alien-prog finds the band once again wrestling their grand ambitions into impossible shapes. And then there's ""Praise Be Man"", a searching, Spiritualized-nodding folk-gospel featuring a rare vocal turn from Cook. On a record with less scope than Empros, ""Praise"" would prove the sorest of thumbs, an out-of-character overreach from a band who oughta stick with what they're good at. Arriving at end of all that interstellar overdrive, ""Praise"" proves an especially lovely comedown, one last burst of light to offset all that darkness.","The fourth LP from this mostly instrumental Chicago trio swings from exceedingly beautiful to punishingly physical in seconds flat. Russian Circles' ever-more-legit metal chops and well-realized compositional ambitions leave Empros feeling bigger and stranger than its predecessor.

Atlantis,FaltyDL,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20fea9e61561daa6888/1:1/w_160/0bcd2c4f.jpeg,2011-11-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16020-atlantis/,Ninja Tune,"Drew Lustman (FaltyDL) has had a busy year. The New York garage/house/whatever producer dropped his second album, You Stand Uncertain, to much acclaim. With the arrival of the four-track Atlantis EP on Ninja Tune, he has also released several EPs/singles of material frequently more vibrant than that which graced the album. (The best of these, ""Hip Love"", received a Jamie xx remix and stands as Lustman's finest track to date, as well as one of Jamie's finest re-works.) Always difficult to pin down, Atlantis proves Lustman hasn't run out of tricks; on a track-to-track basis, it's his most eclectic, challenging release, jumping nimbly between styles, tempos, and moods over the course of each song. Atlantis serves as a showcase for its title track, a five-minute bruiser that is equal parts menacing and optimistic. Built on a powerful, pulsing bass progression, Lustman slips in garage's trademark syncopated percussion; the effect is like hearing Four Tet's streamlined ""Love Cry"" mischievously tweaked then pushed into the red. When the drums momentarily collect and simplify themselves, they act as a release valve for the bass' budding steam. Lustman might have had an anthem but instead chose nervy, sustained energy, and it seems wilier as a result. The remainder of Atlantis is more scattered but no less enjoyable. ""Can't Stop the Prophet"", in particular, feels like a breakthrough: sharp orchestral samples rub against detuned snippets of a dusty torch song, creating enough friction for the drums to slip into 180bpm drum'n'bass. The sampledelic joy of the Avalanches mingles with bass music's natural paranoia and the result is bliss-y, idiosyncratic mindrock. The final two songs, ""My Light, My Love"" and ""The Sale Ends"", hew closer to Lustman's trad garage work, but they're more variant in tone and structure than much of You Stand Uncertain, employing ringing laser blasts and croaking anti-divas. Atlantis is the most manic, undecided release for Lustman to date. Shiftiness can be a curse in dace music-- a realm that often asks its tracks to play nice with others-- but he changes gears frequently in the name of contrast and genuine surprise. Lustman, whom I enjoy more with each subsequent release, already stands as one of the most productive and reliable American dance producers. At the rate he's been putting out music, it may not be long before he removes those qualifiers.","New York producer Drew Lustman's Atlantis arrives the same year as his second LP and three subsequent EPs/singles.

King Krule EP,King Krule,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2045e6ef9596932220e/1:1/w_160/e98144dd.jpeg,2011-11-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16011-king-krule/,True Panther,"This summer's riots in London were unique in that a great deal of those taking part were essentially kids-- young people whose opportunities have been squeezed tight over the past years with widespread youth unemployment and huge University fees. Generational divides can often make the things young people do seem kind of alien, and the riots-- with no spokesperson and no manifesto-- were difficult for some people to comprehend. At just 17 Archy Marshall, aka King Krule, belongs to that frustrated section of the populace, and although he told Pitchfork recently that he didn't riot himself, he understood why others did. His debut EP might not be overtly political lyrically, but there's a wellspring of tension and bleakness running through the record that taps into those feelings of discontent that hung in the air this summer. Often the tension in Marshall's songs is restless and unresolved. ""Lead Existence"", for example, builds for just a minute before snapping shut on the line ""I lost the soul to my blues, a long time ago""-- in itself a pretty haunting line for somebody so young. Then there's his voice, which doesn't seem like it should come from a figure so slight-- it's at turns gruff, deep and often cracked. There are shades of Leonard Cohen in that delivery and a similar drawl at times to Billy Bragg (who himself championed Marshall back when he was going under Zoo Kid). It's an expressive voice, changing and morphing with the mood of the songs. On ""Bleak Bake"" Marshall sounds more laidback over a canvas of dubby keys, 808 drums, and deep bass. That calm delivery makes the violence in the lines, ""My heart got hold of my head and ripped it to its seams,"" and, ""Now I'm covered in blood on the bed/ And its a familiar scene,"" seem all the more chilling. While most of Marshall's lyrics can be bleak or even violent, the instrumentation almost always strikes a warm contrast. There's beauty in the clean, echoing guitars that are all over King Krule and some unexpected moments too-- the jazzy stand-up bass on ""363N63"" or the string hits in ""Bleak Bake"", for example. These textures and sounds lend a redemptive, hopeful quality to the music. EP highlight and closer ""The Noose of Jah City"" is the most complete and focused song on the record. It pivots on an echoing guitar line and sparkling keyboards as Marshall's vocal, enveloped in reverb, spills across that background. In the verses he sounds poised, imagining his own death, stoically predicting, ""My body found, but my soul was left to drown/ Suffocated in concrete."" Marshall's anxiety about his mind and soul is a recurring motif throughout the EP and, like the beauty in some of the instrumentation, makes for a detached, almost mystical contrast to the kitchen-sink vibe of the rest of the drama. There's a documentary realism to much of these recordings, from Marshall's cough at the start of ""Bleak Bake"", to his spoken introduction to ""The Noose of Jah City"". Those moments make you feel like a voyeur sneaking a listen to a work in progress. If there's one flaw, it's that King Krule does seem quite slight in its brevity, and ideas are often left to hang in the air rather than chased to their conclusion. But the record also feels like an important moment in time marked on a door frame-- it's an intriguing peek into the restless, youthful development of King Krule.","On this intriguing debut EP, the 17-year-old Archy Marshall, who formerly recorded as Zoo Kid, pairs his deep, cracked voice and a bleak, restless tension with warm instrumentation. Jazzy stand-up bass and string hits lend a redemptive, hopeful quality to the music.

Replica,Oneohtrix Point Never,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b224ea9e61561daa68a8/1:1/w_160/69b59191.jpg,2011-11-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/,Mexican SummerSoftware,"Everyone who reads about music has a list of descriptors made meaningless by overuse. ""Hazy"" (rhymes with ""lazy"") is right up there for me, but another that makes me wince though I've used it myself dozens of times over the years  is ""cinematic."" It's the term we reach for with instrumental music because movies are where we first learned about the emotional impact of abstract sound. If we'd have grown up in the silent era, we'd be leaning on different adjectives, but given our level of ""moving image + instrumental music"" saturation, ""cinematic"" is what comes to mind. Fair enough. In the past, the music of Oneohtrix Point Never-- the main project of the busy producer Daniel Lopatin, also of 1980s pop revivalists Ford & Lopatin-- fit this term. Albums like the Rifts collection and 2010's Returnal had drones and moods and thematic shifts that hinted at some kind of on-screen drama. And Lopatin has said that he's been influenced by film music and would love to work on movie scores. But the new OPN album, Replica, which also happens to be Lopatin's best work to date by far, is coming from somewhere else. This is music that exists independently, each track a tiny universe with its own cracked logic. A few people have mentioned the Books to me in reference to this album, and the comparison holds water. It's not that Replica sounds anything like the Books-- though it uses tight loops of sampled voices, the voices exist to convey texture rather than language-- but Lopatin shares with them a fresh ear that creates an uncanny sense of wonder in the music. Also like the Books, Replica puts a premium on silence; just as important as all the odd, hard-to-place sounds is the space that frames it. And the combination of unusual textures and all the room, plus the way the music seems unbound to any particular era or aesthetic, makes the whole thing feel playful. The music is by turns dark, ethereal, frightening, and silly, but regardless, it carries in it a feeling of joy. There's a real sense of discovery here, or possibilities being probed, and that feeling is infectious. You can hear the person making it getting deep into what these sonic elements could mean, and he's bringing us down into this fantastic place with him. Aside from the intricate production detail, what's most striking about Replica is how well-constructed these tracks are, which is especially impressive given the record's brevity (the first nine average less than four minutes each). Each has an arc and the music is constantly changing, but the tracks go into unexpected places. The opening ""Andro"" starts with a lonely, distant synth tone and fuzzy layers of robo-voices before becoming overtaken by noisy samples and, eventually, an explosion of percussion from what sounds like a a digital jungle. ""Sleep Dealer"" starts off like a pop version of a Steve Reich tape piece, zeroing in on percussive phonetic ticks and a loop of a human sigh, but it gradually resolves itself in an almost geometric way, as the relationship between the various samples snaps into focus just before the ending. The title track pulls us out of the machine by starting with a simple piano figure and then folding in bits of synth and finally a buzzing drone, becoming something alien and foreboding after starting so warm and melancholy. Lopatin doesn't just introduce sounds, add loops, and fade out; his pieces move, tripping from one place to somewhere far away over the course of just a few minutes. A couple of tracks, like ""Submersible"" and ""Remember"", come closer to the pure synth drone work that marked earlier OPN material, but even these are full of weird surprises, like the distorted and warbly vocal loop at the tail end of ""Remember"" that manages to sound like a field recording of some ancient religious rite, even though it's probably something like a processed syllable taken from a life insurance advertisement. ""Remember"", like the album as a whole, feels peculiar and just out of reach, and it makes me realize how hard it is these days to find music imbued with genuine mystery. A huge part of the fun with this record is that these sonic miniatures are truly puzzling even as they remain accessible and highly musical; Replica is ""experimental"" music that also feels open, and somehow, despite coming out of two speakers like all my other records, it manages to feel participatory. I can feel myself filling in space and making connections as I listen. Most film music is functional and is meant to reinforce images and amplify what's happening in the story. It is manipulative by design, serving to bend the affect of the viewer in accordance with the director's wishes. These 10 tracks are packed with detail and rich with feeling, but they are also, to a strange degree, devoid of manipulation. Even though they're uniformly stirring, they don't point you in any direction in particular, and you could see each listener creating his or her own meaning. Instead of pushing, they serve mostly to draw you closer and remind you of the power of sound as sound. Lopatin may have used samples from 1980s commercials to create many of these tracks, but Replica doesn't use nostalgia as an end in itself. This is music that digs deeper and burrows beneath the level of shared associations to discover the sparkling emotional potential of carefully arranged vibrations moving through the air.","In the past, Oneohtrix Point Never-- the main project of producer Daniel Lopatin, also of 1980s pop revivalists Ford & Lopatin-- had drones and moods and thematic movement that hinted at on-screen drama.

Bad Penny,Spectrals,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20c13d197565213a6ec/1:1/w_160/7a5f8933.jpeg,2011-11-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16019-bad-penny/,SlumberlandWichita,"If you were a committed enough blog-miner in 2009 to have discovered Best Coast's early singles when they were first posted, chances are high that you discovered England's Spectrals the same way. Early tracks from the now 21-year-old Louis Jones similarly mixed 1950s and 60s doo-wop and pop with a modern indie rock mentality. Dense, lo-fi textures and hummable hooks left his work rich in color and personality, and the gritty walls of sound were decidedly punk rock. When Male Bonding included the Spectrals track ""It's Very Kind of You to Put Up With Me"" on the first compilation from their label, Paradise Vendors, it felt like a slow-motion, acid-fueled spin on a creaking Coney Island ride, Jones' soulful croon buried under washes of red reverb. At a point when ear-to-the-ground actually meant eye-to-MySpace, Jones made an account, uploaded some songs, and friended Woodsist and Captured Tracks. The latter label messaged him about a 7"", ""Leave Me Be"", which followed in November of that year, and is now one of the imprint's most essential out-of-print singles. It ushered Spectrals into what ought to be remembered as Gen Y's International Blog-Pop Underground-- a scene that in 2009 included hyper lo-fi acts like Dum Dum Girls, Real Estate, and Twerps. Whether the ramshackle renaissance of 2009 was rooted in fashion or necessity is an open question, but Spectrals were in and of that underground Spector-fueled wave, and have since released material on a handful of international D.I.Y. labels. These groups have all shed some fuzz by now, so it's no surprise that on Jones' first proper full-length, Bad Penny, he makes a similarly slick departure. Indeed, the sound of Bad Penny is related only peripherally to his previous releases. Though it's hardly overproduced, Jones barely employs any reverb at all, and while his evolved sonic identity might be jarring to existing Spectrals fans, the polish sounds better over time. Indie rock readings of Phil Spector pop are almost passé at this point, but Jones makes it work due in no small part to his English wit, articulation, and gray mood. ""Get a Grip"" opens with a small, fun riff, prefacing a crooned rhyme: ""I need to get a grip, I always seem to let my smile slip."" His delivery is slow and monotone, as he stretches each fifth syllable or so, but it's a toe-tapper, underpinned by cool bits of bongo and guitar. The bongo drum returns later on ""You Don't Have to Tell Me"", and whether or not the 50s jazz-club feel comes with a wink, its faux-sophistication still comes over as charming. ""Luck Is There to Be Pushed"" has a similar effect, but this time with the runs of jazz piano that fleck its dramatically soft guitar strums and subtle, gliding synths. The upbeat punch and texture on ""Big Baby"" and ""Confetti"" make for two of the album's most lively tracks, the latter offering a clever joke about dating: ""If what you call fun is courting, bring on the confetti."" That hidden humor makes it easy to celebrate the record's smoothness, even on its more mysterious side. ""Many Happy Returns"", for example, is a slow-moving piece of pop poetry that recalls a hard-boiled Dashiell Hammett novel. Its sway starts with a sharp sentiment of after-school romantic uncertainty: ""Stood waiting for your Ma to collect you/ Wondering if she ever asked you/ Who I was to you?/ And wishing that I knew."" Bad Penny has its weak points. The second track, ""Lockjaw"", is soulful but tired and awkwardly placed, tearing down the mood of the album after a sharp opening, and Jones' lyrics in general can seem recycled. Still, the record's main dividing line is the production, as there is a real philosophical shift that comes with moving away from lo-fi. Slumberland devotees might identify more with Spectrals' original grassroots mentality, but the album's more broadly inviting sound ties the band into a realm of music that rock critic Ellen Willis called ""ecumenical pop."" It's music pleasant enough to carry intergenerational appeal, characterized by a youthful spirit but rooted in a classic sound. Bad Penny, then, is ultimately a solid debut that is still surprisingly safe.","After coming on the scene in 2009 and riding the then-current wave of 1960s-inspired lo-fi guitar pop, England's Louis Jones returns with his proper full-length debut.

1x1x1,Wet Illustrated,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2139d034d5c69bf4af2/1:1/w_160/e79e2957.jpeg,2011-11-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16023-wet-illustrated-1x1x1/,True Panther,"The members of San Francisco's Wet Illustrated are no strangers to the local garage punk renaissance. Tim Hellman, one of two guitarists in the band, played bass for Ty Segall on two of his records. Chrys Nodal, the second guitarist, is also a member of Lilac. They even had Tim Cohen of the Fresh & Onlys serve as engineer for their first 7"". But for all those associations, Wet Illustrated aren't exactly a ""garage band"" in the purest sense of ""fuzz, hook, repeat."" There certainly are hooks, and their vocals are primarily punk-infused yelling, but they also let loose several frantic, gleeful melodies. 1x1x1 is primarily defined by the band's tone, which is alternately flippant and serious. Their giant melodies are one of the biggest selling points of 1x1x1. ""Marketplace"" features a fist pumping, rousing, power-pop chorus. The otherwise aggressive ""Satellite Kids"" calms down in the middle with a soothing mandolin lick. There's another mandolin at the beginning of ""Saints"" backed by some gentle acoustic-guitar strums; moments later, there's more yelling. That's the sweet and sour duality they're dealing with for most of the album. On one hand, twee-leaning (but never cutesy or saccharine) flourishes. On the other, boisterous yelling and loud guitars. That more aggressive and assertive aesthetic becomes problematic after a while-- ultimately, it's a little over 30 minutes of that largely unswerving, monotonous yelling vocal. After a while, it starts to grate. The contrasting attitudes of the record give Wet Illustrated several chances to illustrate what they're capable of, though. They can ramp up the punk aggression on a song like ""My Head"", and within seconds, they're joyously screaming, ""Hey hey hey hey,"" at the opening of ""Claws"". They do well with each look-- they're convincing while they urgently shout paranoid lyrics over a minor-chord progression, and they sound confidently silly with the more upbeat material. But those contrasting tones have a hard time sitting together after multiple listens, especially when they're contained within the same song. ""Herman's Head"" is perhaps the worst offender, with its sunny xylophone counterbalanced with obnoxious lyrics and vocal affectations. But even the most heinous instances of tonal whiplash are fairly forgivable-- Wet Illustrated are, at their core, three goofy-sounding Bay Area punks, and individually, the songs are pretty fun. ""Gypsy Town"" epitomizes the more erratically joyous aspects of the album, with its sun-baked riff and optimistic lyrics (looking down on the clouds while drunk gypsies spread love around). As lyricists, they use a lot of absurd imagery, which works well with their tone. ""Born Stoked"" is another sunny story of a blindly optimistic dude named Stevie-- he leaves his job, but he keeps smiling and seeing good in the world. Even if it's anchored by a 1990s surfer buzzword, it's the sort of subject matter this band can sell without trying. That's probably because, throughout the record, they sound just as optimistic and stoked as this character. Again, that's not always to their advantage, but at least it sounds genuine. At the core of the record is a series of fuzzy pop songs vaguely reminiscent of the work of Robyn Hitchcock or Robert Pollard, guys who could muster infectiously hook-y melodies while being great lyricists. Wet Illustrated are pretty good at both things. Throughout the album, there are hooks that stick and don't let up. They also have the spastically excited lyrics to match that frantic shout, even if some of the words are more abstract. Given the energy pulsating throughout 1x1x1, these songs will probably hit especially hard live. It's unfortunate, then, that they're presented on an album that's a little too crowded.","Despite assocations with Ty Segall and early production help from the Fresh & Onlys' Tim Cohen, the goofy San Francisco punk trio Wet Illustrated aren't exactly a ""garage band"" in the purest sense.

Polymers Are Forever EP,Future of the Left,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21613d197565213a6f6/1:1/w_160/204be353.jpeg,2011-11-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16025-polymers-are-forever/,Xtra Mile,"Despite their name, Future of the Left aren't caught up in politics, but it would be nice if they were. Triangulating toxic levels of intelligence, humor, and aggressiveness, they're exactly the kind of band who could be speaking truth to power. But, for the most part, Andy Falkous forgoes highfalutin political statements and just tells it like it is to us regular schmoes, at the risk of sounding like a jerk. But because even expert-level misanthropes have to deal with mundane problems like label woes (they never really fit on 4AD anyway) and lineup turbulence, the Polymers Are Forever EP is the first we've heard from the gleefully malevolent Welshmen since 2009's bulldozing Travels With Myself and Another With a full-length due next year, these six songs allow FOTL a relatively risk-free chance to regroup and familiarize themselves with some older inventory. Polymers isn't a total overhaul from the taut and punishing Travels, but it does dial back tempos and lean far more heavily on blaring arcade synthesizers-- starting with 2007's Curses, it was the easiest thing to point out when differentiating FOTL from the unimpeachable Mclusky. The title track retains Travel's blunt-force rhythms, but the structure leaves enough for the keyboards to add barbed texture and for an unusually campy Falkous to go ham, so to speak; adopting a nasal vowel-stretching honk to berate science's quick fixes, it's a scenery-chewing, karaoke rendering of Ozzy's coked-out nadir. It's understandable to focus on Falkous' lyrics, yet ""Polymers"" flashes compositional chops that are often overlooked in discussing FOTL, as it bisects into a nagging, hooky first half that leads to a mantra of stuttering syntax that becomes subtly anthemic. Likewise, the best parts of Polymers sonically echo its leader: I didn't think a band could sound sarcastic as opposed to being it, but FOTL play with mean-spirited humor. Check the teeter-tottering polka of ""New Adventures"" that seems to exist solely to mock Falkous' woeful heroin addicts and born losers, or the intentional mispronunciation of a directive to a plastic surgeon-- ""Bob, do it""-- used for an off-beat ""bah-bah-bah-do-do"" chorus on ""Polymers Are Forever."" Obviously, Falkous runs the show, and it's often hilarious, usually bilious, and almost always quotable. He might be too good at it, actually: While ""New Adventures"" is chock-full of enough great set-ups to spawn a dozen comic rants, the song itself plays as a loosely related chain of bon mots instead of a cogent narrative. Likewise, ""With Apologies to Emily Pankhurst"" hurtles forth with a velocity that can obscure a rhyme of pure gold like, ""I fear most women like I fear tomorrow-- absolutely/ I can't let something as French as fear determine this insecurity."" But when ""destroywhitchurch.com"" and ""My Wife Is Unhappy"" take turns into dead-eyed, tensile spoken-word somewhere between Slint and Pulp, they're too obscured in both subject matter and emotion to really be more than just admirably clever. Since Future of the Left are so in their own zone, evaluating a release becomes something of a tautological exercise: It's good that they are around, even if I feel that it's more beneficial for the sake of others rather than my own listening pleasure. It's the sort of band you feel people could learn something from, even if they might be insulted in the process. And while ethically impressive, the relatively diverse Polymers doesn't quite stick around after it's over-- though it can strike you as sweet relief whenever you're feeling like the world's frightening stupidity occasionally owes us the comfort of disbelieving laughter.","With a new LP due out next year, this EP-- the first dispatch from the gleefully malevolent Welshmen since 2009-- allows Andy Falkous and co. a relatively risk-free chance to regroup and familiarize themselves with older inventory.

"Singles, Live, Unreleased",Royal Trux,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b205c0084474cd0c1edc/1:1/w_160/0f096132.jpeg,2011-11-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16012-royal-trux/,Drag City,"Like so many groups fond of noise, lo-fi recording, and insolence, Royal Trux were often classified as a garage band. But for the duo of Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema, the word ""garage"" didn't so much represent a dirty-D.I.Y. aesthetic as a messy, greasy place where things get stripped down, torn apart, and welded back together. Throughout their 12-year run (from 1988 to 2000), Royal Trux took a chop-shop approach to pop history, deconstructing their favorite FM-radio icons-- in particular, Mick Taylor-era Rolling Stones-- and reassembling the scrap metal and wires into heaving junkyard jalopies, with the hoarse-voiced but imposingly beautiful Herrema serving as the hood ornament who could sell their mutant custom jobs as classic rock. Given their amorphous aesthetic-- which yielded works as incongruous as 1990's byzantine bricolage Twin Infinitives, 1995's biker-bar boogie-fest Thank You, and 2000's ghetto-blasted breakdance-athon Radio Video EP-- there is no truly definitive Royal Trux album, a fact reflected by the band's myriad contemporary admirers, who range from Bradford Cox, Liars, and the Kills to Bat for Lashes, Hot Chip, and MGMT. As a 3xLP collection of the band's early-90s ephemera, Singles, Live, Unreleased may not seem like the most logical entry point into the Trux's phantasmagoric universe. But for newcomers, it's the stand-alone release that provides the best big-picture perspective of Royal Trux's see-saw relationship with rock music and the avant-garde. Originally released in 1997 (and now reissued in unchanged form), Singles, Live, Unreleased was more than just a stop-gap measure between albums; it also represented a symbolic homecoming to Drag City after a brief stint on Virgin that constituted one of the more bizarre byproducts of the post-Nirvana major-label signing blitz. After Thank You and 1997's Sweet Sixteen failed to realize Virgin's dreams of turning Royal Trux into the next Black Crowes (the puke-stained album covers probably didn't help), Singles, Live, Unreleased heralded the band's eventual return to the weird with 1998's fuzzed-out triumph Accelerator. Its chronology-- covering the years of 1988 to 1995-- roughly aligns with the period when Hagerty and Herrema were in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that effectively defined the band in its early years and provided an unavoidable lens through which to interpret its music. But as far as junkies go, they were highly functional-- on top of the four official albums released over that span, the band recorded several non-album singles, compilation tracks, and Peel Sessions. (Of the 32 songs collected here, only five appear-- in different form-- on Trux albums proper.) And just as the duo was struggling to get sober over this period, its music was also undergoing its own slow, difficult lurch toward trad-rock accessibility. Going one step further than Hagerty's Rolling Stones desecrations in Pussy Galore, Royal Trux's initial singles sound like all the individual recording tracks from Exile on Main Street spliced up and reassembled at random. Songs like ""No Fixed Address"" and ""Hero/Zero"" possess discernible raunch-rock riffs, vocal hooks, and rhythms, but they sound like they each belong in different songs; at the same time, the duo's use of drum machines and weird synth frequencies-- not to mention Hagerty's Hendrixian facility at pushing standard blues-rock scales and solos into lobotomizing squalls-- lend this primitive music an oddly futuristic, temporally dislocating quality. In the same spirit, Singles, Live, Unreleased negates any kind of linear reading of Royal Trux's evolution, favoring instead jarring juxtapositions of era, musical style, and recording quality. But now, with the band defunct for over a decade, this illogical approach makes a lot more sense today than it did in 1997, transforming the listening experience into an archaeological mission, as each excavated track provides another clue to decoding this strange band. Royal Trux's music may not always make sense to you, but even at its most-messed up, you can still hear how it made sense to them. The more straightforward rockers here (""Steal Your Face"", ""Gett Off"") aren't quite on the level of the ones heard on 1992's self-titled effort and 1993's Cats & Dogs, while the glaring omission of ""Delta 70 of Hearts""-- a ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" to call their own-- from the 1994 Hey Drag City compilation still confounds. But Singles, Live, Unreleased reveals intriguing new sides of the band that were lamentably never explored on their official albums, like the sampledelic pimp-funk of ""Shockwave Rider"" and the blissed-out proto-chillwave of essential '93 Sub Pop single ""Back to School"" (recently covered by Of Montreal). And in contrast to Royal Trux's formative kill-yr-idols tack, we hear a more sincere interpretation of their influences here, including faithful covers of Milton Nascimento's Tropicália chestnut ""Faca Amolada"" and Jefferson Airplane's freedom-rockin' ""Law Man"", and, most curiously, a '93 Peel Session take on ""The Theme from MAS*H"". But in the last case, what on paper appears to be a cheeky exercise in 70s revivalism proves surprisingly devastating, as the song's chorus-- ""suicide is painless""-- takes on a several layers of significance when sung by a couple who once endured prolonged spells of addiction, poverty, and homelessness. Only in the hands of a band as peculiar and indefinable as Royal Trux could kitsch sound so affecting.","Throughout their 12-year run, Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema took a chop-shop approach to pop history. This 1997 compilation represented the duo's symbolic homecoming to Drag City after a brief stint on Virgin that constituted one of the more bizarre byproducts of the post-Nirvana major-label signing blitz.

LIVELOVEA$AP,A$AP Rocky,by: Jeff Weiss,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b217ea9e61561daa6895/1:1/w_160/898d4498.jpeg,2011-11-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/,self-released,"A$AP Rocky violated rule number one of the 10 Crack Commandments: Never let no one know how much dough you hold. The cheddar bred $3,000,000 worth of jealousy after the 23-year old New York rapper disclosed the value of his deal with Sony/RCA last month. The offer was tendered largely off the strength of his first two videos, ""Purple Swag"" and ""Peso"", a pair of codeine fever dreams that recast Harlem World as a slick-talking color-corrected suburb of Houston. To cool-hunting 360-wielding record executives, the videos might as well have been advertisements for the A$AP lifestyle: Colt 45, purple weed and purple drank, dice games, bike riding, brandishing Berettas, clothing designers ostensibly known only to Kanye, and a pretty blonde girl in a grill mouthing the phrase: ""this is for my niggas getting high on the regular."" Picture an episode of ""Gossip Girl"" where Blake Lively watches Traffic and subsequently opts to explore the Danger Zone of 125th and Lennox. Unavoidable in the conversation is the enduring absence of a New York commercial force under 30. Since the emergence of Dipset and G-Unit in the first half of the last decade, NYC rap aspirants have largely fallen into four categories: ringtone wunderkinds (""This Is Why I'm Hot"", ""Chicken Noodle Soup""), technically skilled personality voids (Papoose, Saigon), artful traditionalists (Action Bronson, Roc Marciano, Ka), and Maino. By contrast, Rocky was telegenic and chanting swag. His lead singles poured syrup-slow Houston ride music atop the malt liquor melodies of Harlem's Max B. What Rocky lacked in lyricism, he made up for in narcotic charisma. Seeking street-cred, Drake announced plans to take Rocky on tour. Seeking swag-cred, Lloyd Banks and Jim Jones hopped on tracks with him. Hype metastasizes fastest in New York, and it's easy to conflate the need for a standard bearer with the desire for a savior. Rocky was the chosen one. Hence, $3,000,000. Commence the hating. Odd Future's Hodgy Beats called him ""A$AP Copy."" Old heads looked askance at his appropriation of styles alien to the five boroughs. Blogs painted it as the worst New York investment since the Yankees gave Brien Taylor $1.55 million. Rocky didn't help matters when he allegedly punched out a soundman at the Fader Fort and announced that he and his whole crew had adopted vegetarianism. Thus, every mention of his debut mixtape, LIVELOVEA$AP has pondered whether it justifies the price tag of a Bugatti and several dozen ivory backscratchers. Good isn't enough. People expect Rakim Mayers to be the second coming of his namesake. Of course, the odds are slanted in your favor when you're a rapper named Rakim. You can't exactly sell life insurance. And throughout LIVELOVEA$AP, Rocky embodies the sweat-free cool of someone who has stolen the test and memorized the answers ahead of time. It sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the heavily anticipated debut; there are no ill-fitting famous rapper cameos or last-cup leftovers from $10,000-a-beat producers. Rocky makes no cornball radio plays, nor any awkward attempts to prove his depth. Even on ""Demons"", the record's most emotionally raw track, Rocky is preternaturally self-assured. He's got stomach pains but dreams with the inevitable triumphalism of someone who can convince RCA/Polo Grounds to hand over their Pitbull blood money. After about a minute of complaining, he's back to ""fucking the chick you're next to."" By rough estimate, Rocky fucks about 13 or 14 different girlfriends in the course of the album's 56 minutes. There are two different mentions of Naughty by Nature's ""O.P.P."". He is nothing if not efficient. That's the thing. It's pretty easy to point out the pitfalls of LIVELOVEA$AP. Thematic and lyrical concerns are basically limited to Rocky being a pretty motherfucker, repping Harlem, doing drugs, and getting more women than James Worthy in Houston. Rocky raps effortlessly, switching back and forth between Midwestern double-time to something that resembles Wiz Khalifa auditioning for Byrd Gang. The dark, drugged visions of Memphis rap also creep in throughout. But to his credit, he doesn't waste much time persecuting haters, preemptively striking only once on ""Leaf"": ""They say I sound like André/ Mixed with Kanye/ A little bit of Max/ A little bit of Wiz/ A little bit of that/ A little bit of this/ Get off my dick."" It's more difficult to point out where exactly Rocky excels. He's a good rapper, but he's not Kendrick Lamar. He's melodic, but he's not a walking hook like 50 Cent. His voice is strong but not completely singular. Instead, Rocky has great instincts: the moment when he abruptly switches to his Bone Thugs-N-Harmony flow for a few bars in ""Trilla"", the bizarre song structure of ""Bass"", where he just repeats ""Bass"" in lieu of a hook; the last minute and a half of ""Demons"", where his scrambled lo-fi refrain fades into the chlorine fog of the Clams Casino beat. If anything LIVELOVEA$AP is a triumph of immaculate taste. Rocky's ear for beats is worthy of Rick Ross or early Game. Courtesy of Clams Casino, Burn One, Beautiful Lou, A$AP Ty Beats, and SpaceGhostpurrp, the stellar production makes this something like a swag-rap generation The Documentary. He cherry-picks from the best of internet micro-trends-- taking celestial based weirdness, the funk of country rap, the stoned pace of screw, and the tape-warp of Memphis. But at the core is the French-braided, gold-toothed kid from money-making Manhattan, inflecting his songs with hints of third-generation Spanish Harlem and West Indian patois. For someone who brags, ""the only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror,"" Rocky wisely cedes the spotlight to well-chosen guests, including Oakland's Main Attrakionz, Houstoner Fat Tony, and the larcenous intensity of L.A.'s Schoolboy Q. Meanwhile his A$AP crew shows few signs of being there for reasons of nepotism or weed carrying. ""Houston Old Head"" might be the best sign that Rocky can deliver on his seven-figure potential. It's not necessarily the most memorable song, but it's his most surprising-- a swaggering lean-sipping version of Neil Young's ""Old Man"", with it's chorus, ""If you listen when your old head talk/ You'll be straight."" It's basically the opposite of Odd Future's youth worship-- the admission that occasionally your elders can put you up on game. It shows he's willing to listen and soak up different styles and sounds-- crucial elements for evolution. Even if the fusion initially seems unorthodox, LIVELOVEA$AP is exactly the sort of record you'd expect to hear in 2011 from a New Yorker who was 13 when ""Big Pimpin'"" came out. Rocky did what should've been expected of him; he made a very good record. Now we wait to see if he'll get clientele.","The first mixtape from Rakim Mayers sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the heavily anticipated debut. Piloted by sweat-free cool and stellar production choices, LIVELOVEA$AP is a triumph of immaculate taste.

In real life, of course, such collaborations have a notoriously checkered history. Yet there are still instances when the artists in question present a match too tantalizing to resist, and 200 Years is one such example. The duo is comprised of Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny and Magik Markers' Elisa Ambrogio, and together they draw on the quieter echoes of their other projects to create a charming new hybrid. It helps that Chasny is an old hand at just this sort of collaboration, and a bit of a chameleon besides. In addition to his gigantic Six Organs of Admittance catalog, he has been a member of noise rock troupe Comets on Fire and improv units Rangda and Badgerlore, and his endlessly creative guitar work has been a welcome presence everywhere it has turned up. Each has served as a touring musician for the others' main gig, and Chasny and Ambrogio previously collaborated with Mouthus' Brian Sullivan in the noise-drone Basalt Fingers, but there is nothing from that trio that anticipated the hushed, song-based style of 200 Years. The biggest surprise on 200 Years is Ambrogio and the gentle, almost demure performances that she delivers throughout the album. Though her work with Magik Markers has usually been distinguished by the wide-ranging ferocity of her vocals, there have been glimmers of her quieter side on such studio albums as BOSS and Balf Quarry. Still, it is unexpected to hear her sing so softly at such length, with her voice providing a natural foil for Chasny's predominantly acoustic guitars. At times she recalls the solo work of Barbara Manning or Lois Maffeo, a fact that would be astonishing to anyone only familiar with Ambrogio via one of Magik Markers' feral live recordings. Consisting almost entirely of voices and guitars, there is an ageless quality to 200 Years. The album is bookended by its two most immediately mesmeric songs, ""Wild White"" and ""More Than Alive"", both of which are sturdy, melodic gems that could seemingly translate into any idiom. Here they are given the simplest possible treatment, riding along only on the interplay of Ambrogio's voice and Chasny's expertly filigreed guitar lines, the production so intimate that it feels like eavesdropping on a private conversation. Elsewhere, as on ""Partin Wayz"" or ""Thread"", the duo adds discreet electric guitar effects or a quietly droning harmonium to the mix, always with the lightest of touch. None of these effects will shock those familiar with Chasny's previous work, and in its drowsier patches 200 Years can seem to be merely a Six Organs of Admittance tape with female vocals placed overhead. Which is hardly a bad formula in itself, but it might disappoint those hoping for more in the way of improvisational fireworks. On ""Bees"" Ambrogio does deliver what sounds like a front porch version of her Magik Marker lyrical cascade, with her words casually spilling out just as quickly as she can enunciate them. The most impressive aspect of 200 Years, especially considering it as the debut of a new collaboration, is its overall aura of cool confidence. Chasny and Ambrogio are clearly two talented musicians with a wide variety of tools at their disposal, yet to their credit they don't feel the need to try and show every trick at once. Instead they show an innate sense of trust in one another and in this resonant collection of songs, secure in the knowledge that this should be plenty.","200 Years is comprised of Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny and Magik Markers' Elisa Ambrogio.

You're Never Going Back,Coasting,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20a5e6ef95969322219/1:1/w_160/40ea1711.jpeg,2011-11-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16017-coasting-youre-never-going-back/,M'Lady's,"The charm of Brooklyn duo Coasting's debut, You're Never Going Back, is largely the same as the charm of an early White Stripes record: It's not terribly hard to believe it was made by two people. Make no mistake, that's a compliment: Were indie rock its own island nation, Minutemen's credo of simplicity and Emersonian self-reliance ""We Jam Econo"" would be stitched proudly on the flag. So, in a moment when every bedroom recording artist can GarageBand her own backing Polyphonic Spree into existence, there's something refreshing about a band like, say, Japandroids, whose music sounds like a sonic tribute to the camaraderie of the flesh-and-blood, guitar-and-drums duo. Coasting's crash-pop-meets-surf-rock works like this too: combining rumbling riffage; hyperactive, cymbal-heavy drumming; and fervent, back-and-forth vocals into a classic D.I.Y. sound. This isn't minimalism, exactly: It's the joyful sound of two people trying to make as much noise as they possibly can. Those two people are guitarist Madison Farmer and drummer Fiona Campbell, a New Zealand transplant who's also been drumming with Vivian Girls for a little over a year. Over the first few tracks of You're Never Going Back at least, Farmer and Campbell create irresistibly shambolic tunes (""Starts and Stays"", ""Portland"") that escalate in breathless energy as they creep toward the three-minute mark. ""Kids"" starts unassumingly, in a steady blizzard of cymbals and power chords before it picks up with the intensity of a couple of kids running down a steep hill, hollering double dares all the way down: Pick up the tempo! Play louder! Sing ""Ohhhh!"" Louder still! As in Campbell's other band, echoes of girl-group melodies poke through the grit, as though plucked from fuzzy memories. The feeling is reminiscent of Kicking Giant's 1990s cult classic Alien ID: Its emotional climax is the sound of imperfect, warbling voices imploring, with more volume and punch each time, ""Be my/ Be my baby.” Up until now, Coasting have lived largely in the world of 7""s. The problem with their debut album is one that's befallen countless perfectly good indie bands before them: They don't have enough ideas to fill a whole LP. You're Never Going Back definitely boasts their best standalone tracks, but after a while, the limitations of their sound become apparent. The energy lags in the record's middle section, over a stretch of samey-sounding, mid-tempo numbers. Bill Skibbe and Jessica Ruffin's production keeps things simple and thus captures the freewheeling spirit of the band's live performance, but by the fourth mid-tempo, quiet-loud-quiet jam, you get to wishing for an experimental streak-- or at least another pedal. This might not be a problem for you. There's something inherently affable about Coasting's sound, which has the grimy, big-hearted spirit of an early K Records release. And if you're predisposed to liking garage rock or music that extols the virtues of all things handmade (check that punk rock cross-stitch on the album cover), you are not likely to hold Coasting's lack of sonic variety or next-big-thing ambition against them. This year, though, I'm feeling extra critical, still under the moment-defining spell of tUnE-yArDs' w h o k i l l. That record sounds nothing like You're Never Going Back, but it affirmed something important-- that a record can be brimming with ideas and unabashedly huge, and yet still sound unmistakably handmade. Like a lot of the classics in the indie rock canon, w h o k i l l stands as a provocative D.I.Y. challenge: You can do more with your bare hands and your own voice than you ever dreamed. (No, this idea isn't new; even the dudes who said, ""We Jam Econo,"" made a record with 45 songs on it.) ""I've seen the future and it's perfectly all right,"" Farmer sings with muted pathos on the album's last track, a bittersweet ballad called ""Delusions of Grandeur"". Those aren't always such bad things.","On their debut LP, guitarist Madison Farmer and drummer Fiona Campbell (also of Vivian Girls) combine rumbling riffs, hyperactive drumming, and fervent back-and-forth vocals to create a classic D.I.Y. pop sound.

Humor Risk,Cass McCombs,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b202c0084474cd0c1eda/1:1/w_160/2507584a.jpeg,2011-11-09 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16014-humor-risk/,Domino,"Say it quickly, eliding the r's that cap the end of the first word and the beginning of the second, and the title of Cass McCombs' second full-length this year becomes Humoresque-- a genre of Romantic-period classical music that favored lyrical, mood-based expressions intended to be funny. As a title, Humor Risk functions as a sort of riddle, one where the answer comes quickly but you still feel silly for not getting it earlier. McCombs probably prefers it that way. In a rare, cagey interview with Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal, he defended the grim and elegantly dark WIT'S END: ""You can't just explain a joke, can you? Either it isn't funny, or the person just totally missed the punchline."" To be fair, that record did have a punchline or two buried beneath its incessant gloom. But McCombs' work has never really been expressively funny, and by his standards, Humor Risk is something of a laugh riot. There's a hapless drug deal that ends in murder (reminiscent of Silver Jews' also-pretty-funny ""San Francisco, B.C.""), a philosophical discussion on the nature of beauty in a mannequin factory, and a domestic ghost story that may or may not compare California to a mythical, fire-breathing creature. Another topic raised in that interview is McCombs' reclusive nature and his penchant for personal privacy, which in the Internet age, fairly or not, seems like an unusual character trait. Since we don't know much about McCombs, save for his fascination with death and that he's lived as a nomad for most of his life, it's unclear whether his reservations about giving away personal details are due to something darker within him, or an intent to lend mystique and character to an otherwise relatively normal nomadic singer/songwriter type. Either way, McCombs isn't any more ready to reveal himself on Humor Risk; he delivers many of the lyrics to ""The Living Word"", a meditation on personal and universal spirituality, in a warm half-mutter that requires a lyric book to truly comprehend what he's saying. Religion is a touchy topic for McCombs, and here, even when he's embracing a somewhat positive message of universal existence on ""The Living Word"" and ""The Same Thing"", he's reluctant to say too much. Sonically, however, Humor Risk is his most straightforward and outgoing record to date, and the first time he's cranked up the electric guitars and dry drums since 2007's Dropping the Writ. The album's most upbeat songs chug like poppy mantras-- if McCombs were into such a thing, opener ""Love Thine Enemy"" could comfortably soundtrack some movie or TV commercial-- while the straightforward beauty contained in other cuts is often designed with tricky simplicity. There's an easy likability to most of this album, even if McCombs' ever-present opaqueness seems somewhat superfluous when he's in this zone. Production-wise, McCombs and frequent collaborator Ariel Rechtshaid have made the most of this album's piecemeal-recorded nature (recording was spread out in various homes and studios in California, Chicago, and New Jersey). The backing vocals on ""The Same Thing"" are chilly and hair-raising, while ""To Every Man His Chimera"", which sounds like a WIT'S END cut with enjoyably hammy theatricality added for good measure, is interrupted intermittently by distant voices and barking dogs. Like its creator, Humor Risk just sounds all over the place. In a certain sense, that's a good thing, as it only takes some homespun recording trickery to make McCombs seem distant and vaguely in-transit on even the most hard-driving songs here. Nonetheless, Humor Risk is a minor work in his growing (and impeccably consistent) catalog; unlike WIT'S END and 2009's soft-focus career-high Catacombs, it plays less like an ""album"" and more like a ""collection of songs,"" a factor that may make it something of a difficult initial listen. There are a handful of solid songs on Humor Risk, though, without an outright dud in the bunch-- and if that represents a disappointment, then in the end, the joke might be on us.","Cass McCombs' sixth full-length (and second LP of 2011) plays less like an ""album"" and more like a ""collection of songs."" By his standards, Humor Risk is something of a laugh riot.

Achtung Baby [Super Deluxe Edition],U2,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b212ea9e61561daa688c/1:1/w_160/e02a65e3.jpg,2011-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16022-achtung-baby-super-deluxe-edition/,Island,"""If you give a pop star a shit pile of dough and he refuses to self-destruct, I think it is a bit wet,"" said a smoking, slicked-back, black-sunglasses-clad Bono in a 1993 interview on the UK music show ""Naked City"". ""I think it's part of the deal. If they don't die on a cross by 33, I'd ask for your money back."" Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his U2 mates during this period, it's a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a ""rock'n'roll star."" They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation. A year after Bono's casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in Nirvana's final video, for ""Heart-Shaped Box"", Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one. Achtung Baby and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. ""Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you're trying to say by highlighting what it isn't as if it were true,"" said the Edge on ""Naked City"". ""That's assuming we know the truth-- 'truth' is one of those words that's lost its meaning."" In the 80s, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn't find it. But the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988's album and film Rattle and Hum, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren't crazy about what they saw in the mirror. ""We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok,"" says Bono in an excellent new documentary called From the Sky Down that chronicles the band's pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today's incarnation of U2, it's important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy. So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth. Achtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. Sure, U2 changed their sound from chiming melodics to lurching, distorted rhythm. But they also changed their attitude, their demeanor, their look, their ideas on how to deal with celebrity. All of a sudden, they were funny, sexy, a bit dangerous-- three things few would've associated with U2 in the 80s. And yet, at their core, the band's values remained constant. They were still ethically minded and interested in the real-life connection between living beings. But the way they went about projecting those core tenets flipped. In TV-news parlance, their attitude switched from ""60 Minutes"" to ""The Colbert Report"". This new era was conveniently spelled-out on Achtung's first single ""The Fly"" with the Edge's metallic skronk and Bono's conspiratorial, effected whisper of lines like, ""It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest/ It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success."" And just as the album goes lengths to both fulfill and upend rock'n'roll myths with thorny tales of deep betrayal, questioned fidelity, and ambiguous artifice, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it, too. Take the album's much-ballyhooed place of origin, Berlin's Hansa Studios. This was the location that played host to David Bowie and Iggy Pop's electronic-inspired masterworks Low and The Idiot. And Hansa is located near the Berlin Wall, which had only recently been breached when U2 set up there in the fall of 1990. Perched literally in the middle of historic liberation, U2 were meant to find inspiration in the world events around them and turn that spark into a new version of the band for a new decade. It's a great backdrop for a great story. But it didn't really go down that way. ""We're there, and greatness has left the building,"" Bono recalls in From the Sky Down, which features the band returning to Hansa earlier this year in preparation for their headlining set at Glastonbury. While Berlin did inspire bits of the record-- ""Zoo Station"" was named after one of its prominent train terminals-- it hardly lived up to its lofty reputation. This serves as a lesson for U2, a band that shamelessly worships past rock heroes, to move past such naïve mythologizing. ""Berlin was a baptism of fire,"" says bassist Adam Clayton in the documentary. ""It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city-- that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down."" This newfound pragmatism would help them to move past their fantasies about the sanctity of rock. So while Berlin played a part on Achtung Baby, it did so in surprising ways; though ""One"" was mostly written in a burst of inspiration in Hansa, most of the album truly came together once the group went back home to Dublin. Most of the audio bonuses in this set are unfortunately superfluous, and don't offer much in terms of insight. There are two CDs filled with dance remixes, and while U2 were at the vanguard of big time rock bands embracing the notion of the remix, even the most devout rave nostalgist would have little use for six remakes of ""Mysterious Ways"". The disc of bonus material and B-sides is disappointingly slight, and another filled with early versions of every song on Achtung offers a few revelations-- an Irish jig-style version of ""Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World"" has an easy charm, but generally, it's easy to see why these attempts were improved upon later. Achtung's even more electronic and weirder follow-up, 1993's Zooropa-- which was recorded in a creative frenzy during a break in the Zoo TV tour-- is also included, though it's generally (and somewhat unfairly) glossed over in all the accompanying materials. The worthy additions in this ""super deluxe edition"" are nearly all visual. There's Anton Corbijn's gorgeous and colorful photography that covers its case, as well as a big, sturdy 84-page book. And then the four discs of video: It Might Get Loud director Davis Guggenheim's new 90-minute doc From the Sky Down, every video from the era, a full live gig taped in Australia in 1993, interview shows (like ""Naked City""), and, best of all, a playfully subversive TV special from 1992 that includes live footage from the Zoo TV tour as well as goofy interludes that play up the surrealism and insanity of the whole project. Moments like the ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" video, with the band playing in a glass case while fans look on outside, successfully tie in all the pomo flourishes U2 were chasing. The group was at the forefront of bringing huge video screens into the live arena, and some of the tricks they pull off-- Bono ""dueting"" with a static-y Lou Reed or flipping channels to live local stations-- still look impressive. And for all the technical wizardry of the stage setup, the band still uses it to complement the music rather than overshadow it. Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band-- including U2 itself-- has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way. In the Zoo TV special, which originally aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, a ""news commentator"" covering the show dubs it ""the most significant and exciting TV event since the Gulf War."" Some of the ideas behind Zoo TV and Achtung Baby were inspired by the television coverage of that initial Gulf War in 1991, and the bizarre reality of being able to switch channels from home shopping to MTV to the bombing of Baghdad. U2 recognized the dangers of this idea, when war turned into just more filler for the burgeoning 24-hour TV-news cycle. And instead of preaching against it in a high and mighty fashion, they embraced that chaos in an effort to expose it. Of course, our collective information overload has been upped exponentially since thanks to the internet, making the flashes of words and slogans that backed U2 during their live campaign seem eerily prophetic. Talking about the Zoo TV audience in the ""Naked City"" interview, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. says, ""They're coming to a rock'n'roll show and watching television, what more can you ask for?"" He's joking, but as we go to arenas and see singers on big screens through our cellphone cameras, the question begins to answer itself.","Achtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. And just as the 1991 album both fulfilled and upended rock'n'roll myths, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it.

The Devil's Rain,Misfits,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20813d197565213a6e0/1:1/w_160/a672e0cb.jpeg,2011-11-08 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16015-the-misfits-the-devils-rain/,Misfits,"During the mid-1990s, Misfits founding bassist Jerry Only successfully sued Danzig for the rights to perform and tour under the Misfits name. Ever since, the reconstituted Only-lead group, staffed by a rotating cast of punk-rock yeomen, has traipsed across the globe, delivering a Misfits-like product. It's not that the Only-Misfits are terrible-- the music hews closely to the group's original Buddy Holly-meets-B-movie template, albeit with an added dash of metal riffage-- but it is goofier. Without Danzig's combustible presence, the band softened into predictability, their previous menace petering out into Scooby Doo villain-hood. In 1999, they even popped up in a WCW cage match (and got creamed). Misfits' first album of new material in 12 years, The Devil's Rain, finds the band-- Only, former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena, and Murphy's Law drummer Eric Arce-- coldly chugging through the motions. In their original incarnation, Misfits made blistering music out of seemingly contradictory impulses. They were muscle heads who bashed out primitive rhythms but sang like third-string crooners and obsessed over B-movie imagery. The sound was aggressive, but romantic in its own tacky, zonked-out way. But nothing on The Devil's Rain growls with the unschooled simplicity of the early years-- songs like ""Come Back"" and ""Horror Business"" pitched and yawed on violent, stone-age rhythms. Only, who has taken over frontman duties, just doesn't have the bite in his voice. Where Danzig deftly toed a line between crooning and barking, Only strays too far into the latter category. On ""Curse of the Mummy's Hand"", he sounds like Pat Boone doing Halloween karaoke. His songwriting is largely driven by straight-faced retellings of midnight movie clichés that come off silly rather than sinister. Like the previous Misfits Mk. II records-- American Psycho and Famous Monsters-- the production is notched up to contemporary pop-punk standards, but added polish makes the music feel remote and impersonal. It didn't have to be this way. Since the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan have lost some of their cachet as punk rock cannon fodder, but Misfits' go-to protagonists, the undead, are having something of a renaissance as of late. Between The Walking Dead, True Blood, and Twilight, horror business is good. The Misfits' schtick should stand the test of time. But The Devil's Rain makes supernatural feel like fairly workaday stuff.","Misfits' first album of new material in 12 years finds the band-- founding bassist Jerry Only, former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena, and Murphy's Law drummer Eric Arce-- coldly chugging through the motions.

For the Glory,Nacho Picasso,by: Jeff Weiss,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cd9d034d5c69bf4a91/1:1/w_160/74966400.jpeg,2011-11-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15976-for-the-glory/,self-released,"His Cannabis Club card (probably) reads ""Jesse James,"" but Seattle rapper Nacho Picasso willingly shares a name with something you'd expect to find at a Johnny Rockets in Barcelona. You will either think the alias is awesome or awful. There is no in-between. Yet it's instantly memorable and more fitting than anything that references a Jack Black/Lucha Libre vehicle has any right to be. Since Rick Rubin tried to create the ""worst shit ever,"" rap has a long history of the highbrow-lowbrow game. Or what Ghostface Killah called the ""smart dumb cat."" Robinson is Nacho and Picasso, part fast food, part real deal. He is the hardcore hood nerd, the walking talking paradox writ large. Or as he describes himself on For the Glory: ""Think like George Carlin/ Dress like Carlton/ Ball like Damon/ And wild like Marlon."" Nacho openly claims he's an arrogant asshole, not to be trusted, a bridge burner, and a numbnuts. He dedicates his orgies to Dionysus. His album cover is a picture of him riding a horse dressed as Sir Lance-A-Lot, while flanked by a Harry Potter castle and three nude goddesses. The latter continue Sir Mix-A-Lot's proud Emerald City tradition. Picasso proves that you don't need to practice the art of storytelling when you've mastered the art of saying nothing. And For the Glory is basically a paean to girls, guns, tattoos, chronic, and comics. There is an entire song, ""Marvel"", wherein Picasso basically compares himself to every summer blockbuster of the last decade. While it should feel like second-rate MF Doom, Nacho spits slick and (partially) revelatory internal rhymes. He repeats, ""Smoking/ Reading comic books,"" until it becomes mantra, like the kid from the cover of OutKast's ATLiens grown up. If anything, For the Glory is a snub-nosed self-portrait. Picasso condenses information into one or two bars with the ease of a 1990s 5 Percent rapper. ""He's been a bad guy/ Since his dad died."" The self-aware scumbag redeemed through his honesty and arrant goofiness. On ""Moor Gang"", he describes his life as ""Big butts and boobs/ Blunts and booze/ Watching Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze/ With my Steven Urkel frames and custom-made shoes."" And he even has the restraint to refrain from a Vanilla Ice punchline. That's the thing about Picasso, he knows how to vividly render an image and largely avoid cliché. Even when he resorts to the tired mobster/rapper dualities of ""Benjamin Segal"", he avoids the obvious Tony Montana trap. Circa 2011, the norm is rappers so tatted-up they might as well be married to Sandra Bullock. But Picasso is one of the few who makes it seem like more than fashion accessory. On ""Sweaters"", the self-proclaimed ""tat in the hat"" describes his body as a timeline and his face as something ageless. Later, he says he's inked like a Rorschach blot and a fourth-grade desk. Half of the record captures Picasso as the affable stoner drawling in a seen-it-all baritone about 1980s professional wrestlers and characters from Half Baked. The guy who would insert a lesser remembered clip of White Men Can't Jump just for the fuck of it. The other side is the ruthless hustler whose car ""looks like Iceland,"" who lashes out against ""bitches who say that he looks like Chris Brown."" The Black Flag-shirted, bare knuckle-gypsy, who shares his dead dad's love of anarchy. The end result is language-drunk and spliff-lit disorientation in the cold vein of vintage Cam'ron, late-period Curren$y, and the post-Def Jux disorderly conduct of Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire. Picasso references his internal turmoil but never delves too deep. Nor does he need to. In his worldview, there is little nostalgia for the past or dreams of the future-- just the weary gray of the hustle. Lyrically, Seattle doesn't factor in much, other than a stray reference to being from the city where they ""bust heads and clean clocks."" Thankfully, producers Blue Sky Black Death and Raised by Wolves provide the requisite Pacific Northwestern pallor, providing moody beats that suture ""Stepfather Factory""-era El-P to the mercury float of Clams Casino. During a year in which Shabazz Palaces has earned Seattle hip-hop more buzz since the last time slackers wore flannel, Picasso grabs his fair share of the spotlight. For the Glory is one of the best rap debuts of the year, one that simultaneously manages to say everything but reveal nothing. Or as George Carlin would have said: Language is just a tool for concealing the truth.","Seattle rapper Jesse James, aka Nacho Picasso, knows how to vividly render an image while avoiding cliché*.* His language-drunk, spliff-lit For the Glory is one of the best rap debuts of the year, one that simultaneously manages to say everything but reveal nothing.

Panic of Looking,Brian EnoRick Holland,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fc13d197565213a6c6/1:1/w_160/da6d4955.jpeg,2011-11-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16005-panic-of-looking/,Warp,"A 16-minute EP of leftovers, released in conjunction with a little mountain town's music festival-- doesn't sound very exciting, does it? But you could put Brian Eno's name on the cover of just about anything and generate intense anticipation and scrutiny. Our prime architect of interdisciplinary electronic art has so much authority that when I don't love one of his records, I feel disappointed in myself. That was the case with Drums Between the Bells, a worthy but uneven collaboration with the poet Rick Holland, where sonic miracles sat cheek-by-jowl with dated electronic styles perhaps better left in mothballs. Now, from the same sessions, comes Panic of Looking. It's very slight, and its clearest purpose is to augment Eno's recent residency at Asheville, N.C.'s Moogfest (which honors electronic music pioneer Robert Moog), where the EP received an early release. But even Eno's spare parts give us something of substance to chew over. Panic of Looking is distinguished from its father LP by placing more emphasis on the words. This is a happy development, because poetry is delicate. It can sound strained, or even fake, when it tries to scale the visceral heights of music. Instead, music must lay back. If the glitchy sonics of Drums Between the Bells sometimes ran roughshod over the words, Panic verges on overcorrection. Eno has engineered it to feel like Holland's show-- spoken-word with accompaniment, sometimes engaged and sometimes desultory. It can be difficult to discuss the musical quotient because there's so little of it. The most developed tracks are ""In the Future"" and the title piece. The former draws out the tonality of speech via placid melodic counterpoint and euphoric backing vocals, recalling the joyous world-pop of Eno/Byrne collaboration Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. The latter may be the best-balanced effort the collaboration has produced, with Eno's taut textural background sensitively augmenting Holland's staccato verse. Beyond those, we get a minute-long lite-industrial curio, a pro forma instrumental, and a couple less memorable fusions of orotund speech and crepuscular atmosphere. Poetry writing and poetry recitation are two very different talents that don't always-- or even often-- coexist. Inverting classical music's emphasis on the concert hall over the recording, modern Western poetry favors the written word over the oral performance, which has become something you do mainly in order to sell books, regardless of whether or not you're any good at it. It's a weird cultural construct: Imagine if musicians were expected to promote their work by juggling. As a result, even poetry lovers may emit a long-suffering groan at the prospect of attending yet another reading. But there are things oratory can do that text simply can't, and Holland exploits them to his advantage, especially on the title track. One of them is homophonic ambiguity: Is he saying ""speed and weight"" or ""speed and wait?"" Both concepts are compelling, especially in flickering juxtaposition. Biting off words one by one, Holland creates hard enjambments (""Men… shake… hands"") that deliver doses of meaning, each altering the last, as if from a time-release capsule. If all of this sounds more geared toward Eno completists and poetry fans than the general listener, that's about right.","This 16-minute EP of leftovers comes from the same sessions as Drums Between the Bells, Eno's earlier collaboration with the spoken-word artist, and once again it feels more geared toward Eno completists and poetry fans.

Fear of God II: Let Us Pray,Pusha-T,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2005e6ef95969322208/1:1/w_160/eb4daf00.jpeg,2011-11-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16010-fear-of-god-ii/,DeconRe-UpGOOD,"As a solo artist, Pusha-T has a home in popular rap, but that doesn't mean he also isn't out of place. After an infamously torturous decade or so in the industry, Pusha now resides comfortably at G.O.O.D. Music, the imprint run by Kanye West that most notably houses guys like Common, Kid Cudi, and Big Sean. Pusha is the only guy remotely resembling a street rapper at the label, and though it's hard to figure out exactly what role he plays in the context of the label or even the genre writ large, it's a marriage that probably makes more sense than not. The days of Pusha, Drug Kingpin are long gone and have been for a while. Maybe the rapper that Pusha most resembles now is Rick Ross. Though Pusha's cocaine-dealing past is bona fide (or close enough that no one bothers to question it), his identity as a drug dealer is now merely an imagined idea, a cachet that he rides but one that's far back in the rearview. The act of selling drugs, and the burdens and spoils that come with it, rarely enters his music anymore, and when it does, it rings as hollow as Ross' claims that you can call him up right now on his iPhone and score some dope. But of course it doesn't really matter if Pusha and Ross slip into personas either old or imagined, because a lack of proper reality or authenticity in rap has never dragged down music that was good in the first place. Where the Pusha of old was a witty and smart street hawk, the Pusha of the last five years or so has mirrored Kanye's and Ross' obsessions with luxury. If anything, it's in his ability to bridge the gap between those two rappers that Pusha finds his identity; he is as comfortable rapping about a yacht that a drug dealer might own as he is rapping about a scarf that a fashion designer might own. But as Pusha has inched his way into the elite of rap, his music (including the material he recorded with his brother as Clipse after their 2006 album Hell Hath No Fury) has become exponentially less vital. He raps about luxury because he's a rich and famous rapper, and that's what rich and famous rappers do, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that move, it's decidedly dulled the impact of his writing. Pusha has always carried himself with the bravado and ego of a star, and that was galvanizing when in his early years he played the role of a dealer-turned-rapper. But as a regular rapper who pops bottles in penthouses with a bunch of other rappers, that egotism has become commonplace, if not off-putting. Yet here's the funny thing about Fear of God II, his first commercially released solo album: It proffers that, well, maybe none of that even matters. Pusha's rapping still noticeably pales in comparison to his peak years, and it would be hard to argue that there is any justification for the album's existence beyond Pusha needing to do something-- yet the stakes are so low that the sheer listenability of the album can sneak up on you. Its quality is mostly a testament to Pusha's connections and his ear for beats, but the rapping is sufficiently competent enough that the album never drags, which is less of a backhanded compliment than it might read. It doesn't seem like much thought was put into sequencing (French Montana shows up on two straight tracks) or thematic cohesion (""Feeling Myself"", the album's one slick R&B song, is followed up by the metallic jitter of the HHNF throwback ""Raid""), but that strangely only intensifies the strength of the album, which is that Pusha collected seven or eight great tracks and then mostly got the hell out of the way. The process of releasing a rap album through a major label is so arduous now that albums often arrive in stores pushing 20 total songs with almost the same number of guests. Fear of God II's brevity is both refreshing and crucial to its success, and it likely speaks to Pusha's self-confidence that he felt comfortable clipping the tracklist at 12. This is ruthlessly professional rap music, and though that might seem like the baseline for releasing a major-label rap album, 2011 has been an awful year so far big-box releases. Pusha may be a fish out of water performing on a weepy Kanye ballad or being in a crew with John Legend, but releasing a major-label album with consistent rapping, great beats, a rational guest list, and a sane running time qualifies as a minor miracle right now.","One half of Clipse, and the only guy remotely resembling a street rapper at Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint, offers his first commercially released solo album, a collection of ruthlessly professional rap music.

Crazy Clown Time,David Lynch,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f1ea9e61561daa685a/1:1/w_160/5d7d144c.jpeg,2011-11-08 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/,PIASSunday Best,"If you've ever thought of director David Lynch as being ""weird,"" suspend that thought for a moment. That weirdness-- the visceral, surrealistic imagery and fragmented plots in his movies-- is exactly what we as viewers want from him. You probably like it weird now and then. I do too. It's what thrills us, confuses us, and keeps us coming back for more. One of the elements that defines Lynch's films is the way he uses music, especially music from the 1950s and early 60s. Seemingly innocuous songs are set in relief against scenes of violence or desperation in ways that reveal some latent passion that might be hard to hear on oldies radio. The era is crucial: Slowdances and big-bad-wolf blues are styles whose tensions are born of repression. Making your sexual desires known was not much of an option in the 1950s, so the music worked via metaphor and concealment and, as a result, quaked with subterranean energy that had no safe outlet. Lynch's scenes provide that outlet. When he uses a song as soundtrack, he transforms it. Music in his movies arrives at high-water moments. Dennis Hopper does himself up in lipstick to Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"" before assaulting poor Kyle MacLachlan in Blue Velvet, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring sob to Rebekah del Rio's performance of Orbison's ""Crying"" in Mulholland Drive, and Jack Nance, saddled with his horrible alien baby at the edge of domestic sanity in Eraserhead, is serenaded by a tiny, grotesque woman inside his radiator. In these scenes, the music is used in the same way that we as listeners often use it: to pump ourselves up, to give us space to emote, or to find solace. Lynch's sense of music is intuitive that way, and probably one of the most plainly sympathetic aspects of his movies. Crazy Clown Time, while technically a proper debut full-length, is far from the first time Lynch has had a hand in the actual writing and performing of music. He was making noises with Alan Splet as early as Eraserhead, and has done soundtrack work on nearly every movie he's directed through 2006's Inland Empire. He recorded a pleasant-enough ""soundscape"" titled The Air Is On Fire in 2007, and in 2009, he released the Fox Bat Strategy EP, a collaboration featuring musicians with whom he'd worked since Fire Walk With Me, including deceased vocalist Dave Jaurequi, to whom the record was dedicated. And before these, he produced and wrote lyrics for two airy makeout albums by singer Julee Cruise in the late 1980s and early 90s which ought to be studied by all young women who try to sing like undead phone-sex operators. But Crazy Clown Time is largely a solo project, and most of its material is what you might expect from an album made by David Lynch: tense, repetitive bluesy music permeated by reverb and echo. The remaining few songs-- including the record's first single, ""Good Day Today""-- are not. These other songs are disco, sort of: dark, mid-tempo electronic pop. Karen O sings in places (most prominently on the album's standout opening track, ""Pinky's Dream""), but the bulk of the album is actually sung by Lynch through vocoders and other modulating effects. (If you've seen Lynch's movies but never heard him speak, you are depriving yourself a harmless treat. Here.) His lyrics are also more or less what you might expect: simple, fragmented, and a bit dull on the page, but threateningly voiced in his high, twanging pitch. Unfortunately, none of these songs actually feel like songs. Only a few have choruses or any significant chord changes. Instead, they're set pieces, which makes sense: Lynch's films often seem to be more about luxuriating in his atmosphere than about following his plots, and that carries over to this music as well. But as unfair as this observation might seem to Lynch as a musician, the question I end up asking after listening to Crazy Clown Time is: Hasn't he already accomplished all this in his movies more successfully? In light of his filmography, the album feels familiar to the point of redundancy. Why does he stop with seven minutes of lecturing in a robot voice about how to think positively? Couldn't the album use more abstraction-heavy lectures about positive thinking conveyed in robotic voices? I think so. But maybe I only think that because I come to Lynch for surprise and disruption. It's been five years since Lynch made Inland Empire. From what I can tell, he spends a lot of his time in the spotlight eagerly promoting Transcendental Meditation. He recently designed a nightclub in Paris. So, alright. My purely speculative guess is that Crazy Clown Time is just part of a temporary break from feature filmmaking-- not as heinous as some vanity projects, but an album that will satisfy some personal need, be minorly exciting to fans who will follow him wherever he goes, and end up ignored by both parties in time. Anyone who hasn't seen his movies would benefit from seeing almost all of them before listening to it.","Most of David Lynch's official debut, featuring vocal contributions from Karen O and Lynch himself, is what you might expect from an album made by the filmmaker: tense, repetitive bluesy music permeated by reverb and echo.

GLAQJO XAACSSO,patten,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fe13d197565213a6cc/1:1/w_160/8f32e257.jpeg,2011-11-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16008-patten-glaqjo-xaacsso/,No Pain in Pop,"GLAQJO XAACSSO is a fittingly obtuse name for London producer Patten's debut EP. The record-- full of scrambled sounds you recognize from elsewhere-- feels like it could exist in a parallel universe. The sensation of this music, which does have a peculiar thrill to it, can also be a frustrating riddle: At times, you'll want to dive into the waveforms and pull the fragments back into a right order and find some sense. The collection's probably more engaging a concept or idea than straight-up listen, but there is fun to be had in the way the beats spin your head. Less concerned with the relentless drive into the future than some of his peers, Patten's forging a sound off the beaten path, cherry-picking past sounds and twisting them. Much of the record finds Patten looking toward 1990s Warp acts. ""Blush Mosaic"" takes Boards of Canada's icy synths and softly pushes fast-forward, revving something glacial into something manic-- the aural equivalent of a stop-motion nature video. Vocals drift in and out as rhythms weave around each other. It's one of the record's strongest statements, and a track where Patten's sometimes unfocused energy comes together to make something engaging, trippy, and destroyed. On ""Fire Dream"" there are shades of Plaid and Autechre, especially in the pale analog synths. Patten matches that patchwork with powdery hi-hats and head-knocking beats. It's not only piecemeal scraps of Warp influence in the music, though-- there's a general influence in attitude and approach. Even the baiting LP title seems like the kind of brick wall Richard D. James or Chris Morris would erect. That approach carries over to the source material: Nothing feels too holy for Patten to throw into the blender. On the strongest moments, like ""Blush Mosaic"" and ""Fire Dream"", the bent circuitry is visceral and engaging, but there are instances where those loose rhythmic threads don't knot together so well. Take the motion-sick ""Out the Coast"", where the beats collapse into each other and don't quite blend with the rest of the action. It feels like there's something good buried within, but the effect is jarring and disorientating (not pleasantly so). A problem with his whirlwind approach is that each idea's so quickly processed it can leave the results feeling too breathless or rushed. A nice moment passes so quickly that it immediately becomes a dot on the horizon. There also isn't a great deal of contrast on the record. And not a lot of warmth. It's here Patten strikes the biggest contrast with the artists he might be referencing or reminding you of: A great deal of music on that IDM spectrum that Patten picks apart has heart to it. On his Come to Daddy EP, for instance, Aphex Twin closes the record with the gorgeous ""IZ-US"". Likewise, Squarepusher, at his busiest on ""Port Rhombus"", pulls away the rhythmic carpet to reveal a lilting, lush guitar. There are no moments like this for Patten, and for all its movement, GLAQJO XAACSSO feels a little frozen.","GLAQJO XAACSSO is a fittingly obtuse name for London producer Patten's debut EP.

IOTDXI,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fdb1335d7bf169a37e/1:1/w_160/5a530362.jpeg,2011-11-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16007-iotdxi/,R&S,"Of all the great hubs for forward-thinking bass music the past half decade (see: Hotflush, Hyperdub, Punchdrunk, Hessle), Belgian-born, London-based R&S Records has the deepest roots. Since its founding in 1984, artists like Model 500, Joey Beltram and Aphex Twin have roosted there; its logo was parodied by London's queer disco party Horse Meat Disco. When the label returned from an absence in 2006 and set up shop in London, bass music was a natural focus. Concentrating on singles and EPs, the label has since released some of the most adventurous material by James Blake, Untold, and Lone. IOTDXI is a 2xCD/3xLP compilation that collects highlights from the past 18 months and, as is the custom these days, presents 10 exclusive tracks as well. Everyone (including myself) has pontificated about the spreading tendrils of bass music, but sometimes it feels less like evolution and more like insects scattering after a rock's been lifted. The fervor with which the bass community has adopted deep Chicago house, Berlin minimal, and Detroit techno has begun to feel like an abandonment of purpose. What's most refreshing about IOTDXI is listening to a group of artists who have largely clung to quick syncopation, mildly aggressive bass, and arrested vocal samples. High praise: The highlights disc contains a handful of songs so familiar they threaten tedium. Blake's ""CMYK"", Lone's ""Coreshine Voodoo"", and Pariah's ""Orpheus"" form a potent trio in the middle of the first disc; anyone who hasn't worn their bytes thin on mixes and DJ sets the past two years is encouraged to do so here. The disc is better, perhaps, at reminding us of the young talent R&S has put to wax. Cloud Boat offers sighing dubstep heartbreak on ""Lions on the Beach"" (and is noticeably absent from the exclusives disc), while the lightly whipped synth-pop of Vondelpark's ""Camels"" feels refreshing at the close of the first disc. Appending an exclusives disc to a retrospective has become common practice for electronic music labels, but I wonder if a game-theory course or two wouldn't help them better incentivize their artists. Knowing that the label will be judged, not the artists, seems like a surefire way to collect the fourth-best track sitting on every producer's hard drive. (Another problem, of course, is that these exclusives sit opposite the producers' best by design.) R&S has enough talent on the roster to remain appealing. Lone places piano house in a blender on ""Cobra"". Blawan returns to form after his disappointing ""What You Do With What You Have"" single, offering aggressive, hoofed dubstep. The curious Space Dimension Controller apply lush, lounge-y tempos to analog video game patter. You'd be right to assume that your collection doesn't need Oneohtrix Point Never's gassy remix of ""Orpheus"" or the Chain's tech-y, mundane ""Suffer for Your Art"". We can safely write these off as consequences of format, because the overriding message that IOTDXI delivers is that R&S is a healthy, engaged label equally capable of housing established talents and coaxing out fresh ones. If there's no explicit sense of direction or momentum, perhaps that's because R&S understands permanence more than most of its peers.","This 2xCD/3xLP compilation collects highlights from the past 18 months of the Belgian-born, London-based R&S label, including previously released work from James Blake, Lone, and Pariah.

Everybody Get Close,The Juan MacLean,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f9ea9e61561daa6868/1:1/w_160/cbf5d1c4.jpeg,2011-11-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16001-the-juan-maclean-everybody-get-close/,DFA,"The Juan MacLean, aka John MacLean, has been with the DFA since the beginning. In many ways, his story is the story of the label itself. Much like DFA's core group, LCD Soundsystem, the ex-Six Finger Satellite musician came to dance music from an indie/punk rock background. He released a string of well-received 12""s-- his first predating LCD's breakout ""Losing My Edge"" and beaten onto the tracks only by the Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers""-- before eventually maturing into a solid album artist. These transitions from rock to electronic, and from DJ-oriented 12"" to albums, are also the tensions that animate the label. With that in mind, it's been interesting to see how MacLean has responded to releasing one of the label's strongest, and perhaps least expected albums, 2009's The Future Will Come. First, he offered the house classicism of his 2010 DJ-Kicks mix; now we have the previously released odds-and-ends of Everybody Get Close, a collection that both dimly mirrors Future and shows MacLean stretching into the production of more faceless but more functional dance tracks. Like The Future Will Come, this record's varied electro tracks are anchored by one awesome 10-minute workout. Here it's ""Feel So Good""-- with its endlessly building house pianos, rolling background percussion, and Nancy Whang's clipped come-ons, it almost reads like a dub version of his 2008 single ""Happy House"". (In fact, it makes the actual version of ""Happy House"" that's included here-- an alternately wan and annoying nu-Balearic rework by Cut Copy-- feel more superfluous than it already is.) Two remixes of Future's lone ballad ""Human Disaster"" appear as well-- the Holmes Price version holds onto MacLean's regretful singing and heavy, hanging piano chords, but sets them against trilling synths and an old-school electro beat; Jee Day smears the piano chords into a haze of reverb then brings them back as a muffled loop that echoes the triplet pattern of ""Happy House"" amid an unnecessarily busy rhythm track. The album is bookended with the two cuts that sound most like Future B-sides, the vocal electro of ""Find a Way"" and its vocodered echo ""Everybody Get Close"". The tracks that fare best are those that veer furthest away from Future's Human League-meets-house template. For instance, ""Let's Talk About Me"" is a squealing, percolating acid track with pitched-up vocals reminiscent of Zomby's ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"" (and therefore of a whole swath of circa 1992 rave). ""X2"" is a dark, sonar-pinging track that could pass for Shit Robot. ""Deviant Device"" is a floating bit of dubby ambient techno that slowly unfolds over nine minutes to become one of the most enjoyable tracks on the collection. Sadly, Everybody Get Close doesn't function as a benchmark of MacLean's between-album progress, as it collects tracks dating back at far as four years. Some of these feel like scraps and sketches, others like the B-sides they are-- which is fine when the scraps are this frequently exciting-- but given the range of his output so far, what would be most satisfying would be to get a glimpse of where MacLean's heading next.","This collection of previously released odds-and-ends both dimly mirrors 2009's album-as-artist statement The Future Will Come and finds John MacLean stretching into the production of faceless but more functional dance tracks.

So Outta Reach EP,Kurt Vile,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ccea9e61561daa6816/1:1/w_160/62568da6.jpeg,2011-11-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15964-kurt-vile-so-outta-reach-ep/,Matador,"The songs on So Outta Reach were technically written during the same sessions that brought us Smoke Ring for My Halo, Kurt Vile's still-resonant 2011 breakthrough, but the boundaries separating Vile's recordings, at this point, are growing irrelevant: His discography is starting to blur into one long, drawn-out sigh. Listening to hours of Kurt Vile, you get the impression that he once discovered the Neil Young lyric, ""Though my problems are meaningless/ That don't make them go away"" from ""On the Beach"", decided to lie down in it a while, and just never left. Like other cultishly obsessive songwriters, however, Vile manages to repeat himself without strictly repeating himself. Images and phrases cycle through his lyrics like tumbling socks in a dryer-- he mumbles the phrase ""two packs of red apples"" on both ""Red Apples"" from 2009's God Is Saying This to You, and again on Halo's ""Runner Ups"". His releases often feature alternate versions of the same song, which happens here with ""Life's a Beach"" and ""(so outta reach)"", the second a faint echo of the first's muted shuffle. These are the sorts of subliminal tugs that map out the contours of a universe, and Vile has carefully built one with small tools-- his mutter, a bottomless cavern of reverb, and glimmering tangles of guitars-- and painted it a dozen shades of steel-blue and watery gray. So Outta Reach, then, is a dispatch, another stop along a journey, and it's as good a place to tune into his frequency as any. ""The Creature"", the opening song, spins out another fragile variation on the wearily bemused blues he's perfected. His acoustic fingerpicking remains stunning, a narcotic blur of voicing that recalls his friend and former touring partner Jack Rose. Like Rose, or like early Elliott Smith, Vile's playing retunes your hearing to the limitless possibilities of the plain old acoustic guitar. Fingerpicking is, of course, a skill acquired only through endless hours hunched over the guitar; it's no coincidence, perhaps, that Vile's lyrics speak overwhelmingly of friends lost, the dull pain of being left behind, and the sad savor of solitude. So Outta Reach includes a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Downbound Train"", blanketed in stoner-rock distortion, and its hard-luck, ""now I work at a car wash,"" story folds seamlessly into Vile's landscape. But a careful study of his lyrics turns up little Zen-stoner nuggets of wisdom, like this one from ""Life's a Beach"": ""Life's a while."" The line reminds me of Chevy Chase advising that ""a donut with no hole is a Danish"" in Caddyshack, and suggests there's a sense of humor lurking beneath Vile's drooping curtain of hair. Dependability is an unglamorous virtue to champion, yet at this point I reach for Vile's music like a glass of water. There's simple joy in the knowledge that falling for one Kurt Vile song practically ensures I will love a dozen others. I don't often find myself thinking about Vile when his music is not playing, but his music nurses a profound ache, and he's now made enough of it that it's become a whole corner to visit, a unique transmission that feels like its own sentient being. As an artist, it's hard to aim higher than that.","This six-song EP, which contains material recorded during the Smoke Ring for My Halo sessions along with a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Downbound Train"", is another satisfying stop along Kurt Vile's overall journey, and as good a place as any to tune into his frequency.

Parallax,Atlas Sound,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1efc0084474cd0c1ebe/1:1/w_160/d76d959a.jpeg,2011-11-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15998-parallax/,4AD,"Bradford Cox knows a thing or two about creating a schism between his everyday self and the one he presents on record. In interviews he's garrulous and outspoken, ostensibly brimming with confidence, yet plagued by insecurity. All that self-doubt manifests itself in his solo project, Atlas Sound, where he often sounds small, alone, and cut adrift from the world. At times Cox seems at odds with himself, but dig deeper and there's usually a thread running through his real-world activities and the ideas he obsesses over when recording. And he's always recording. Last year, Cox released four albums of Atlas Sound demos as the free-download Bedroom Databank series. It's a wonder he can keep track of all his work, but one of his biggest talents-- aside from his rich vein of form as a songwriter-- is as an editor. Not only does he know exactly what to release officially and what to preserve as a blog-only treat for fans, he's also intuitively adept at compartmentalizing material into his Deerhunter and Atlas Sound worlds. Despite the separation, those two modes aren't mutually exclusive, and it's always interesting to see how Cox's two guises feed off each other while retaining strong individual identities. The last Deerhunter album, Halcyon Digest, ended with ""He Would Have Laughed"", built around a spaghetti-like loop of synthesized noise. It mirrors a trick that's revisited just a few songs into Parallax, on ""Te Amo"". Here, Cox leans on a repeating pattern, then pulls away from it by testing the elasticity of his vocal range, stretching into a gruff register he's rarely tried out before. Atlas Sound often functions this way, taking baby steps on the road to evolution and leaving traces of previous material to ground the listener. The two constants are Cox's fascination with ambient music and the unabashed sadness at the heart of his writing. ""When you're down, you're always down,"" he croons on ""Te Amo"". Crooning has held Cox's interest for a while now. Versions of Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and the Rodgers and Hart standard ""Blue Moon"" appeared on his blog back in 2008, and his cover of Joe Meek's ""Valley of the Saroos"" is one of his most impressive giveaways. Lately, Cox has been playing around with image, something he hasn't attempted much since his early dress-wearing days in Deerhunter, and he appears to have settled on a hybrid of Meek-ian high hair and David Bowie's plastic emulation of the rock'n'roll era circa Let's Dance. On the Mick Rock-shot cover of Parallax he's even depicted clutching a vintage 1950s microphone. So it's appropriate that this record begins with ""The Shakes"", where Cox casts himself as an idol who's grown bored of fame, money, and hangers-on masquerading as friends. It echoes Bowie's weary exasperation at the clamor for fame in the documentary Cracked Actor, where he rides around middle America in a limo and compares himself to a fly swimming around in his glass of milk. That link to Bowie loops back to the Young Americans-style sax solo on ""Coronado"" from Halcyon Digest, further indicating how one Cox project informs his others. But his omnivorous approach to music history, and the restraint that keeps him from drawing too much from his heroes' own sounds, makes Parallax a constantly shifting delight. In the past, Cox's affinity for masked vocals allowed him to keep his guard up, stopping listeners from encroaching on his malaise. Here, he uses fewer vocal effects, and the gentle balladry of ""Modern Aquatic Nightsongs"" and ""Terra Incognita"" benefit greatly from it. This cleaner approach to his art demonstrates his growing confidence as a singer and songwriter and feels more involving. But that's only part of the picture. Because Cox likes to confound, surprise, and keep his audience guessing, one of his shiniest pop moments yet lies at the center of this record. ""Mona Lisa"" is a jaunty piece of melancholia-tinged guitar rock, hung up somewhere between the livelier moments on R.E.M.'s Green and the rural tug at the heart of the Kinks' best material. Comparing this track with the deliberately jaded lyrical framework of ""The Shakes"" highlights one of the most fascinating juxtapositions about Cox; he's so well versed in music history that he knows he'll hate the pitfalls that await him if proper fame comes beckoning, and yet his inclination toward deeply accessibile songwriting and infernally catchy pop melodies might drive him in that direction anyway. There's also more bridge-building on ""Mona Lisa"" and the garage-y ""My Angel Is Broken"", where he sounds confident and vulnerable at the same time, drawing some of that swagger he possesses in real life into his art. Parallax feels like a more complete work than any other Atlas Sound record, with the differences between the songs less distinct and everything flowing together more naturally. ""Quick Canal"" was a standout on Logos but it also stood alone, feeling like a neat one-off collaboration with a hero (in that case, Stereolab singer Laetitia Sadier) that didn't readily come into focus in the overall picture. There are no such loose strands here, and the closing ""Lightworks"" ends the album wonderfully with a tremoloed guitar shuddering against Cox's hankering vocal line and uncanny pop nouse. It's another testament to his editing skills; he can effortlessly balance a sizable load of contrasting styles and slot them together like it's the most natural thing in the world. That lightness of touch is on display throughout this album, providing greater gravitas to Cox's brittle self-examination. Parallax still makes him sound small, alone, and cut adrift from the world, but the way these songs breathe suggests he's more comfortable in his own skin, allowing him to draw his audience closer than ever.","The third Atlas Sound record is a more complete work than any of Bradford Cox's earlier solo ventures.

In Animal Tongue,Evangelista,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ebea9e61561daa684d/1:1/w_160/d34da787.jpg,2011-11-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15995-evangelista-in-animal-tongue/,Constellation,"Through all her varied disguises, from the Geraldine Fibbers to Ethyl Meatplow and back, Carla Bozulich's barbed voice has always been an instantly recognizable instrument. With her versatile project Evangelista, she seems at last to have found its ideal vehicle. In Animal Tongue is the latest album under the Evangelista name, and hearing it can feel like watching a veteran character actress with an expertise for perfecting new accents finally sink her teeth into a meaty, recurring role. Though In Animal Tongue stills draws on many of the same elements that have informed her previous work (blues, industrial noise, spoken word) they have here been distilled ever further down to a murky, brooding essence. Never an especially conventional band to begin with, Evangelista have been gradually edging away from standard rock textures. Whereas previous albums Hello, Voyager and Prince of Truth contained sudden moments of loud metallic catharsis, In Animal Tongue is almost entirely percussion-less and frequently arrhythmic. Bozulich is joined once again by bassist Tara Barnes and arranger/multi-instrumentalist Dominic Cramp, who provide a necessary degree of continuity, but there is something essentially solitary and lonesome about Evangelista's music. With her lyrics filled with references to blood, natural danger, and combat, Bozulich gives In Animal Tongue the impression of a wild animal crouched ominously in a darkened corner, waiting patiently for the opportunity to strike. From a sonic standpoint, Evangelista's most natural ancestor is the noisier work of Tom Waits circa Bone Machine or The Black Rider. Unlike Waits, however, Bozulich makes no use of either grand, weepy melodies or any vestige of wry humor. Indeed the semi-spoken whispers and mutters of such tracks as ""Black Jesus"" or ""Die Alone"" can seem to lack any sense of movement, with Bozulich’s bleak and emotive vocals (""My body has failed me on this cold night, and I'll die by myself in the dark"") destined to circle endlessly through the shadowy wilderness. After a point this lightless gloom can get a tad oppressive, but Evangelista are able to leaven the mood somewhat through consistently inventive instrumentation. The album's most percussive track, ""Hands of Leather"", is driven by guitar and handclaps, and though its lyrics might easily be about a boxing match, the impact is that of accidentally stumbling onto an ancient forest ritual. On ""Tunnel to the Stars"", the rhythms drop away to be replaced by a churning string quartet, composed by Dominic Cramp, with Bozulich's distorted vocals riding queasily over the din. Most arresting of all might be the closing piece, ""Hatching"". On this track Bozulich's voice makes the briefest of cameos, while the rest of group shudders through what could be an obscure horror-film score. It is a sound that is not a million miles away from the haunted, sample-based soundtracks of Demdike Stare, blending live instrumentation with Dominic Cramp's cut-and-paste arrangement, and one that suggests that Evangelista should continue to find ways to cut new paths through the darkness.","The latest album from Carla Bozulich's newest project finds the barbed-voiced musician drawing from many of the elements that informed her previous work (blues, industrial noise, spoken word), but distilling them to a murky, brooding essence.

Far Side Virtual,James Ferraro,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e99d034d5c69bf4ab9/1:1/w_160/be7a4fbb.jpg,2011-11-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/,Hippos in Tanks,"James Ferraro's latest stares down our contemporary world of the future, invaded by iPads, overwhelmed by Skype meetings, and caught up in the unnecessary conveniences of self-serve frozen yogurt spots, with an equal sense of dread and awe. All those 1980s and 90s approximations of the future, in which we'd collectively have luxury stacked on top of luxury, actually sort of arrived, and they're totally awesome-- and really fucking creepy. Far Side Virtual is inspired by goofy junk like the Windows 95 sound (composed by Brian Eno, it should be mentioned) and the melodies that kick out of a medium-priced keyboard when you punch the ""demo"" button. It's a collection of eerily wholesome sounds delivered in an uncomfortably straightforward manner. Either a whole lot of work or very little work went into this record. This is a ""sell-out"" album. Not in the pejorative sense of pandering-- it's actually a much more difficult listen than his previous work-- but because it's intended to score mindless comfort and endless hours of outlet shopping. And unlike his other releases, which toyed with similar concepts of getting lost in the technological, consumerist singularity of energy drinks, action flicks, and worldwide web convenience, this one doesn't send the soundtrack through the gossamer hum of a VHS. There's no distance between the concept and the execution here. Every sound on, say, ""Fro Yo and Cellular Bits""-- a triple threat of rocking drums, melting synths, and a guitar solo that wants to be Eddie Van Halen but comes closer to Stan Bush-- is clear as a bell. Indeed, the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even the point. Such dedication to an aesthetic means Far Side Virtual gets a little tedious: It's 16 songs that aren't all that catchy but aren't exactly ambient either. Subsumed by his concept, Ferraro is one with the buying and selling machine, which was perhaps his perverse goal all along. ""Hopefully these songs were made available for ringtone,"" he declared in this Elle interview, ""and the album will be condensed into ringtone format, so the album won't be the centerpiece, it will just dissipate into the infrastructure."" There is however, an obsessive focus on authenticity that really works towards justifying the album's goofy indulgences. Quite a few tracks feature a robotic voice speaking to you (""Sir, Richard Branson's avatar says hello""), providing a bizarre, world-building aspect to the project. And, hey, this kind of music is pretty great! There is a place for pleasant, lilting tunes made to be ignored. The propulsive MIDI symphony of ""Dubai Dream Tone"" and the stiff jazz on ""Adventures in Green Foot Printing"" are undeniable and surprisingly affecting-- like a cyborg Vince Guaraldi was placed in front of a keyboard and told to knock out some somber tunes. The nightmarish qualities of the music begin to break through on ""Dream On"" and ""Condo Pets"", both of which possess some of the creepy, cacophonous drone of Citrac or Night Dolls With Hairspray, subtly unveiling the horrors behind music that's just way too springy and wide-eyed. You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always.","Inspired by goofy junk like the Brian Eno-composed Windows 95 sound and the melodies that kick out of a keyboard when you punch ""demo,"" Far Side Virtual is a collection of eerily wholesome music delivered in an uncomfortably straightforward manner.

Or as one DJ put it to me, edits arose from the pleasure principle, that ""when you hear something great, you want it to continue."" Early disco DJs used them as secret weapons for their dancefloors, as did hip-hop's pioneers, spinning familiar songs into alternate universes, but after the heyday of Chicago house masters like Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles, the edit as a DJ tool faded from view. While London's DJ Harvey dropped his series of ""Black Cock"" edits in the mid-1990s, it was when Detroit producer Theo Parrish's self-deemed ""ugly"" edits (complete with slapdash spray-painted labels) lurched into view at the turn of the 21st century that the trend came back in full force. Rather than resort to using scalpel and cutting block, the technology allowed dancefloor professionals like Prins Thomas, Pilooski, and even James Murphy to drop such reconfigured tunes. It also allowed newbies and bedroom DJs alike to make their own edits, albeit to diminishing returns. Theo Parrish's limited disco edits remain in high demand, getting bootlegged repeatedly (a bootleg of a bootleg?) and going for ludicrous sums online. And while this collection has neither ""Ugly Edits"" nor Theo Parrish's name anywhere on the art, the handy 2xCD set compiles the first eight editions of those edits released over a three-year period. It's not just an affordable compendium of the wiggly, playful, grimy, and irreducible disco edits the man had his way with, but also a fine gateway into his wholly idiosyncratic soundworld, suggesting a common ground between Larry Levan and Brion Gysin. Always an inscrutable music-maker, with productions eschewing the distinctions erected between house, jazz, funk, avant-garde electronic, and soul music, all of Parrish's traits can be heard in the perfect opening track, a woozy, spiraling edit of Jill Scott's ""Slowly Surely"" from her 2000 debut album. Starting with a glitching CD, tocking drum machine, and a voicemail from the singer herself, she thanks him for a CD that she has yet to listen to. She talks of her over-protective manager but that polite backpedal transforms into a gently cycling whispered plaint: ""I just don't know where I should go."" Pillowy soft chords lift and drift back down; a woodblock and some other random percussive moments get foregrounded only to dissipate. Yet somehow 12 of the most effervescent minutes in house music have surely drifted past. The set's bread and butter is in how Parrish dices and lengthens funk and soul cuts by acts such as the Dells, Minnie Riperton, Willie Hutch, Funkadelic, and Kool & the Gang. He takes Sylvester's ""Dance"" and boils it down to rubbery bassline, incessant hi-hat, and a pickup line for its first three minutes before the dancefloor release comes. In teasing out Sugarhill Gang's late-period joint ""Hot Hot Summer Day"", he lobs off all their wack rapping and instead elevates the melted-butter backing vocals from the last third of the song, spinning a nine-minute epic out of it. Which is not to say he emphasizes only the bright, dancefloor-friendly aspects of tracks. When he takes incidental music from Quincy Jones's score for The Color Purple, a clanging polyrhythmic vocal chant dissolves into a disquieting stab of strings. In reworking slick boogie band GQ's ""Lies"", he offsets a loop about ""a party going on"" with a man agonizing, ""I got to know why,"" to a cheating woman. On the easily recognizable Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' Philly-Soul classic, ""The Love I Lost"", Parrish drops us midway into the track. He makes Teddy Pendergrass' honeyed yet gritty vocals bump against the sparse organ and guitar opening of the song (with plenty of vinyl crackle at the edges) before dumping both atop the propulsive middle section. What makes its sloppy nine minutes work is how he swings the equalization to extremes on every component, finding new spaces and juxtapositions where there previously were none. What should be familiar and mere repetition is anything but. As he once told Resident Advisor: ""Repetition kind of sets a certain mass in a song… then there's little bits that come in and out and these changes that kinda shift on that pivot. This is where I go in my head sometimes… shifting, spinning, all kinds of stuff."" Consider these 18 tracks, then, the results of Parrish's ever-spinning musical centrifuge.","This 2xCD set compiles the first eight editions of Detroit producer Theo Parrish's ""ugly"" edits.

Ambition,Wale,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fa9d034d5c69bf4ad3/1:1/w_160/93d4396f.jpg,2011-11-04 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16002-wale-ambition/,Warner Bros.Maybach,"Ambition: Wale certainly can't be faulted for it. After his 2009 Interscope debut Attention Deficit bricked, selling a chastening 28,000 copies its first week, most presumed he would disappear soundlessly, like his fellow 2009 XXL Freshmen classmates Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton. He had failed to become a serious pop star, represent his D.C. hometown, or smuggle social consciousness into the rap mainstream-- his three bedrock campaign promises. But instead of disappearing, Wale caught the eye of Rick Ross, just as the Miami kingpin was transforming into commercial rap's all-devouring center of gravity, and climbed aboard Rozay's ascendant Maybach Music Group. Ambition, the result of a pairing nobody saw coming, inaugurates the curious second phase of Wale Folarin's increasingly fascinating career. The record is a testament to the virtue in the album's title. Never say Wale doesn't learn from mistakes: Everything that dragged down Attention Deficit, from hipster-baiting to its bewildering guest roster, has been jettisoned, along with introspection and any lingering modicum of respect for women. On Ambition, Wale is reborn as an unrepentantly shallow strip-club rapper, and the production is a gleaming phalanx of freshly minted beats from Ross' MMG assembly line. The album is unmistakably a product of Planet Boss, the lurid neon kingdom of B-movie saxes and cartoon excess in which Rick Ross has built his empire. And Ambition provides a remarkably effective demonstration in how a shpritz of Planet Boss can jumpstart a flagging rapper's fortunes. Wale's complete persona 180 will strike his original fanbase as repellantly cynical, and there is something vaguely unsavory and disorienting in the eagerness with which he embraces his new role. But it turns out that many of the gifts that got him noticed in the first place-- a nimble tongue, a high-stepping flow-- lend themselves as well to flossy nonsense about watches and women as they did to examining the sociopolitical implications of Soundscan. And Ambition is a high-velocity parade of flossy nonsense, with an extremely dense ratio of Headslaps-Per-Minute: ""I'm sort of like Socrates in a Prada T""; ""I aspire for awesome/ That requires some flossin'""; ""Fuck rap, I get pussy off of haiku."" There is a Sandra Bullock namedrop that references the 1992 sci-fi comedy Love Potion No. 9. Everything is fast-moving, breezily entertaining, and patently ridiculous. Even swilling champagne at the winners' table, however, Wale remains something less than ""fun."" He always had the gift for seeing the negative that you might expect from someone who structured an entire mixtape around clips of old Seinfeld dialogue, and it rears its head in a lot of ranting about silencing his critics. ""Sippin Moscato with models, havin exotic dishes/ But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected,"" he gripes on ""Don't Hold Your Applause"". And his smooth-loverman approach, bluntly, needs fine-tuning: on the treacly slow jam ""Lotus Flower Bomb"", he offers the hilariously stilted compliment ""Took you forever to get dressed/ I acknowledge your effort."" Uh, thanks, Wale! The production, however, from a cannily sourced collection of lesser-known beatmakers and big names, sounds uniformly incredible: Ambition is the first sign that Maybach Music Group has flowered into a full-blown production house. Mark Henry, who has produced some sledgehammer beats for Fat Joe, gives Wale the fleet-footed ""Miami Nights"", which pipes in some woolly sax from Ross' ""Maybach Music II"", and the window-fogging funk of ""Double M Genius"". Toomp chops up strings like early-millennium Just Blaze on ""Legendary"". MMG stalwart Tone P serves up, among others, the brain-rattling ""Chain Music"". The album will sound devastating pounding out of passing Escalades, and it is currently slated to pound out of many; early estimates peg Ambition's first-week sales at around 170,000. Those numbers will surely provide a certain vindication for Wale, but above all they signal a triumph for Maybach Music. When Ross signed Wale, I joked that Rozay must have lost his taste for money. But his imprint has taken a temperamental rapper whose name had become synonymous with commercial kryptonite and molded him into a passable pop star. Listening to Ambition, I began to wonder what delirious commercial miracles Bawse might cook up for Pill, Meek Mill, and the other seemingly unmarketable rappers on his roster: Meek Mill with a No. 1? Pill with a gold plaque? Who knows. What Ambition proves beyond a doubt, however, is that commercial rap, right now, is Ross' world. People like Wale, if they are lucky, get to live in it.","On Wale's fast-moving, breezily entertaining, patently ridiculous Maybach Music debut, Rick Ross has taken a temperamental rapper whose name had become synonymous with commercial kryptonite and molded him into a passable pop star.

The Vision,Joker,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f8ea9e61561daa6866/1:1/w_160/97331cde.jpeg,2011-11-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16003-the-vision/,4AD,"Pop music amplifies and lionizes its creators by default, while empathy comes from the capital-M music and the community. This has remained true as the music industry has changed and it has remained true as DJs-- Daft Punk, David Guetta, Deadmau5-- have risen to pop-culture prominence. It's why so much of the coverage of an artist like Robyn focuses on her smallness and approachability; it is not the norm. On his debut album, Bristol-based producer Joker (Liam McLean) wants to be a hero. The Vision, arriving after years of delays and false starts, is not for the industrial streets of Bristol, London's maturing club culture, or the small pockets of hyper-aware American undergrounders eager for bombast that doesn't result in our getting wedgied in a mosh pit. All of those scenes are made to feel small next to the righteous blockbuster-ing of The Vision, an album so impressed with itself that there's little need for the listener to be so. It's not hard to figure out how Joker arrived here. As part of the ""purple"" (post-) dubstep movement, Joker (along with Gemmy and Guido) suggested that the end-game for dubstep's engorged bass rumble did not have to be masculine aggression. He unleashed a nearly bulletproof string of singles and for well over a year did seem heroic-- his superpower a Magneto-like control of your mid-range dial, his age proof that there were skills yet to harness. His breakout came as dubstep was graduating from pervasive force to ubiquitous cultural presence (in England) and seemed to cement his status as a comer. That The Vision is more pop-oriented, more streamlined, and more self aware won't be a surprise to anyone who has paid attention. It paints the picture of a producer who not only missed his moment but whose verve and craft dissolved as he waited. The Vision buckles, repeatedly, under a mass of unwieldy guest appearances, pandering pop moves, and Joker's ever-present, oxygen-eating synths. An album meant to display a producer's power and confidence-- from the title to the cover art on down-- instead reveals a reliance on formula and a crippling indecisiveness. Grime, R&B, stadium pop, and dubstep all come in for the most tepid of updates. Most of the collaborators-- on board to tease out those genre plays-- are ill-chosen and marginally talented. With the exception of Jessie Ware (Santigold to Katy B's M.I.A., right down to her bigger voice and handful of kickass tunes), they serve as haughty ciphers, funneling heaps of entitlement and no small amount of paranoia into these tracks. Silas, on the functionally widescreen ""Slaughter House"": ""They wrap you up in plastic and ship it to the store."" Who? 4AD? (More damning still, from Silas: ""You can hang around and see what the hook brings."" I can!) ""On My Mind"" is ""Love in this Wal-Mart"" for the post-Timbaland set. It features the line, ""Rumor has it that you want a man with a big di-di-[ed. note: wait for it] digital following."" This is presented without a hint of humor or irony; somewhere Lonely Island's number three is slapping his forehead. Joker's most fruitful and charming vocal collaboration-- ""Music (4am)""-- perplexingly misses the cut. What's most distressing is that The Vision doesn't sound like Joker's version of R&B and hip-hop ruined by less talented collaborators; it sounds like Joker's version of the same ruined by Joker. He has strip-mined his chewy, mid-range melodies for their largess, applying it liberally to standard verse-chorus-bridge structures. Removing the cast of self-aggrandizing twits from ""Back in the Days"" doesn't get you to ""Digidesign""; the children's choir on ""Lost"" is a far cry from the whirling-dervish-house of ""Snake Eater"". The best ""classic"" Joker track included is ""Tron"", an early-2010 offering that preceded the unrelated Hollywood remake that you've already forgotten about and was thought at the time to be among his weakest tracks. The comparison I keep coming back to for The Vision is Canibus' Can-I-Bus, American hip-hop's nuclear option for unrealized potential and perceived slights. Like Can-I-Bus, The Vision required a perfect storm of bad advice, arrogance, and wretched timing. It irks that a series of Joker's peers-- among them SBTRKT, Rustie, and Magnetic Man-- have established a blueprint for bass producers looking to go pop without sacrificing direction or personality. On ""Slaughter House"" Silas finishes his rhyme: ""They wrap you up in plastic and ship it to the store/ But deep in your bones you know you were made for something more."" On an album of terrible, throwaway lines, this is the worst: Joker was absolutely made for this. He arrived fully formed, a shy kid buried in synthesizers and video games, born for music. Whatever has transpired since, The Vision seems to be exactly what Joker wants: UK pop&B of the vainest and most vacuous possible variety.","On his guest-heavy, pop-oriented debut LP, Bristol-based post-dubstep producer Liam McLean leans on formula and shows a crippling indecisiveness.

Neverendless,Cave,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b186c0084474cd0c1e16/1:1/w_160/76483ee4.jpeg,2011-11-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15921-cave-neverendless/,Drag City,"CAVE's newest album is all movement. The first quick, rhythm-dominated moments of opener ""WUJ"" propel Neverendless forward. The Chicago psych collective has likely been studying up on krautrock for a long time, and it dives headlong into that territory with a motorik drive, bass grooves, and Neu!-reminiscent synths. It's a lead track that knows how to build-- beginning with a sparse canvas, over the course of seven minutes it maintains a steady groove while adding and switching out layers. CAVE don't throw away that psych fuzz they do so well-- halfway in, the volume ramps up and the guitars become markedly heavier. That sturdy rhythm remains for the entire seven minutes, but they don't settle on one sound: They quiet down, increase the volume, add subtle licks, string airy synths above their guttural guitars, and all the while, establish a few central hooks. The band's bread and butter is creating spacey psych jams; in that sense, Neverendless doesn't break new ground. What is new is the feeling of focus and structure in their music. While previous albums Psychic Psummer and the Pure Moods EP felt looser, more spontaneous, jammy, and sometimes more erratic or meandering, Neverendless sounds premeditated and perfectly executed. They've never been sloppy or careless, but never quite this tight. That structure likely comes from a semi-rigid percussion blueprint and a few well-defined melodies within each song. This is CAVE's first outing as a four-piece, and they find an easy synchronicity with each other-- when they make a change in the groove, everybody falls in line (except maybe the drummer, who maintains the largely unswerving drive). Even spastic guitar solos fall neatly into the confines of the beat. It's also CAVE's most elegant record to date, mostly because of ""On the Rise"", six minutes of warm, slow ebullience. Soft synths mimic wind instruments and pepper a steady beat. They introduce a handful of melodic, joyous guitar hooks. In the only prominent vocal of the album, they chant, ""on the rise,"" repeatedly, in an almost ceremonial way. The song is a surprising move. On plenty of albums by jammy psych rockers, one go-to vibe is menace-- it's easy to make a largely instrumental song with prominent bass sound big and intimidating. It's much harder to create something that sounds warm or inviting. They achieve that here without compromising their established feel-- a reverb-drenched, rapid-firing guitar leads the chanting vocals into another calm groove. Neverendless also suggests that they do much better when given time to spread out. The four-minute ""Adam Roberts"" is the shortest and worst track of the bunch. The bassline is oppressively big and repetitive, followed by an organ that evokes obnoxious circus music. There's no build, no contrasting elements, and, in the end, nothing to look forward to-- just four minutes of the same semi-obnoxious riff in the middle of the album. Regardless, the record keeps moving. Sometimes it moves with warmth, and sometimes with motorik rhythm. On the 14-minute ""This Is the Best"" it pushes forward with a droning synth that lies underneath the rest of the song's layers. Seven minutes in, crunching guitars and buoying bass runs bury that synth. There are swirling, moaning vocals for a moment, and the guitar goes from a quick riff to an evenly spaced trudge. And through those gradual changes in the song's structure, the percussion holds sway. The drums make one change that stretches out for the song's final minutes, going to a hurried snare. It meets up with some equally hurried synths, which lay out a cluttered feeling of anxiety. And it doesn't stop for a few minutes. With hit after hit of urgent-sounding synths and drums, CAVE never let up or get faster, either. That's what they do best on Neverendless-- they just keep going.","The Chicago collective's bread and butter is creating spacey psych jams-- in that sense, the band's first album as a four piece doesn't break new ground.

Time's Arrow EP,Prurient,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f713d197565213a6bd/1:1/w_160/e3abe430.jpg,2011-11-03 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16006-times-arrow/,Hydra Head,"""Time's arrow"" is a lovely phrase to describe the seeming unidirectional progression of time, the sense that it's been traveling perpetually forward from the Big Bang to whatever the ending point of the universe will happen to be. It's also the cheeky title of Dominick Fernow's new Prurient EP, which itself rumbles inexorably and sometimes unbearably forward until it reaches a Big Crunch that sounds as apocalyptic as the one promised by some physicists. The five tracks here seem to be slowly shedding the trappings of music itself, all the dark-pop armature Fernow has grafted onto Prurient's old shriek-the-pain-away sound over the last few years, until all that remains is fearsome and formless noise. On Time's Arrow, the comforts of familiar rhythm and melody are stripped back, track by track, to reveal the snarling, primal sound mass from which they were beaten into shape. With a jittery programmed beat that recalls Big Black at their most despondent and yet more sour synth squiggles that prove John Carpenter is the biggest influence on the darker end of electronic music in the 21st-century, the title track takes off from the creepy-but-clearly-defined hooks of Prurient's brilliant Bermuda Drain album from earlier in 2011. It's a possible contender for jam-of-the-year for all the ex-goths, one-time industrial obsessives, and collectors of soundtracks from obscure 1980s horror movies. But the rest of the EP sounds like it was made by a lunatic from one of those obscure 80s horror movies, as if that deranged slasher had somehow escaped into real world and been asked to record a few tunes for a cassette label. And you can imagine the sort of emotions such a jolly fellow would want to express through sound. So the beat becomes a nearly arrhythmic clattering on ""Let's Make a Slave"". They keyboard melodies become cover-your-ears squeals of distortion, as if someone were jabbing a knife into an amplifier. Following the brooding but almost catchy ""Time's Arrow"", Fernow's most conventional song yet, order itself seems to be breaking down across the rest of the EP, a vibe brought home by the blasted, end-of-the-world atmosphere and Fernow's increasingly desperate last-man-on-Earth vocal perfomances. By ""Maskless Face"", his eerie monotone monologues have given away to frustrated howlings that express nothing but rage, and even that connection to human pain is severed by the EP's end. ""Slavery in the Bahamas"" plays like a rapid-fire tape collage of the ugliest sounds the post-industrial world has to offer-- the spluttering of downed power lines, the disembodied groans of information sluicing through a modem, buildings and machinery being crushed to nothing-- as if the whole show was coming to a swift and brutal end. But Time's Arrow ends not in a deafening silence after the final track’s implosion. It's perhaps no accident that ""Slavery in the Bahamas"" ends with the faint sound of a lovely tune sneaking its way out of the squall. If you play the EP on a loop, this snatch of pleasant human music-making seems to lead quite naturally back into the title cut. Of course if you then play the EP straight through again, everything comes crashing down once more. With a kind of grim pleasure, Time's Arrow suggests that all that effort, writing songs and constructing coherent albums, will always eventually give way to the chaos that rumbles dangerously under any attempt to impose control over noise, if you just let go.","Dominick Fernow's new EP rumbles inexorably forward until it reaches a Big Crunch that sounds as apocalyptic as the one promised by some physicists.

Fatty Folders,Roman Flügel,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1df13d197565213a6a2/1:1/w_160/341053fe.jpeg,2011-11-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15983-fatty-folders/,Dial,"Techno thrives on agendas. Whether innovation, futurism, rebellion, or austerity, such creative constraints help rein in the limitless possibilities of synthesizers and samplers. Roman Flügel is not exempt from this. A veteran of leftfield electronic production, Flügel has released professional DJ mixes and collaborated on a jazz/techno hybrid; he works under different aliases (Soylent Green, with collaborator Jörn Wuttke in Acid Jesus and Holy Garage) for varying styles. (Several years ago he made waves with his ""Dirty Dutch"" anthem, ""Geht's Noch?"".) Many of his releases are 12"" singles, utilitarian in purpose if not sound. So naturally one of the greatest aspects of Flügel's debut LP under his given name, Fatty Folders, is how untethered and adrift it is. This is not to say that Folders is experimental, just that it's difficult to place. As best I can tell, Flügel has no overriding purpose other than to produce gummy techno, the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth (and the kind you happily leave up there). Flügel has seen a decade-plus of singles, collaborations, and live sets receive near-unanimous praise. His 12""s, while diverse, have tended toward the mechanistic and throbbing, though he's always been slightly out of step with his contemporaries in the German scene, eschewing the severe austerity of Ostgut Ton and the lush minimalism of Traum. (Dial, a Hamburg-based label whose releases often seem rote and plain before revealing intricacies, is as good a home as any for Flügel.) Folders collects a handful of tracks from recent EPs and singles but offers mostly new material and, as such, stands as the most accessible and robust barometer of his work to date. Folders doesn't offer any kind of narrative-- not of Flügel's career, not of a broader music scene, not even intra-album. On display instead is the sheer variety of sounds Flügel conjures, and how vibrant they seem in his arrangements. If Flügel has a trick-- though he is not really the type of producer who relies on them-- it's saving his tiniest, most erudite melodies for his bangers and getting big-eyed and starry during his softer moments. ""The Improviser"" falls into the former category, its rude, burping bass barely ceding any ground to the dubby vibraphone sounds that sneak in. On the other end of the spectrum, the panning, glowing sunrays of ""Krautus"" would be at home on any Field record, and ""Don't Break My Heart"" sounds like a pleasant Saturday morning in a clock repair shop. If there's one true monster track on Folders, it's the previously released ""How to Spread Lies"", a patient, autumnal mid-tempo caress that relies equally on a descending piano melody and a subtle, four-note bassline. That it's been out for over a year won't matter to anyone but the most vigilant Flügel fans. (Considering both ""Lies"" and ""Geht's Noch?"", it would be somewhat ironic if the versatile, understated Flügel were remembered mostly for a few standout tracks.) Fatty Folders is a summation of Flügel's career not in sound but in scope: It's multifaceted, rich, and cagey. He's worth the investment for casual techno fans, even if you only have time for the CliffsNotes.","After a decade-plus of singles, collaborations, and live sets, the leftfield German electronic producer releases a debut LP under his given name.

Blouse,Blouse,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ea9d034d5c69bf4abc/1:1/w_160/b6d3aa16.jpg,2011-11-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15993-blouse-st/,Captured Tracks,"I often return to this line from Simon Reynolds' Retromania: ""Unlike digital formats, analogue degrades through overuse: each listener kills the sound she loves."" There's a certain comfort in that kind of reciprocity, and anyone who's ever accidentally reset the listening history on their iTunes library and felt like they'd wiped a part of their identity clean is familiar with the digital world's maddening indifference to our affection. With that observation, Reynolds hits on the unifying and fundamentally human allure of chillwave, lo-fi, smear-pop, and any other kind of contemporary music that makes a conscious choice in an Auto-Tuned world to sound less than pristine. It's music trying to approximate the grubby, hopelessly destructive way we love books, records, and each other. Like a pre-owned Delorean or a Berlin cassette slowly decaying in the bargain bin, Portland trio Blouse's self-titled debut comes to us sounding like it's already been colored by somebody else's use. Though it's got an unabashedly Reagan-era sound, it's the record's almost pathological obsession with the past that places it so squarely in the now. Any of its 10 tracks could sit comfortably on pretty much anyone's 2010s playlist: it broods like a lower-fi version of Charli XCX's Cold War-tinged tunes, it beams through cloudy dark like John Maus' murky pop, and it even boasts a song called ""Videotapes"" on which the synths sound like warping videotapes. And yet, Blouse amounts to something more evocative and suggestive than trendy pastiche. There's one obvious reason: Some of these songs are just really that good. ""Into Black"" strikes the right balance of lush atmosphere and driving force, while the mid-tempo ""Controller"" evokes an austere cool. It's album opener ""Firestarter"", though, that best expresses the young band's manifesto, introducing them as a dream-pop group intent on razing the roof. ""Let's forget the ceiling,"" vocalist Charlie Hilton beckons beguilingly over a wash of twinkling synths, ""It's just made of stone."" Hilton's voice is breathy and commanding though not terribly distinct-- think Victoria Legrand channeling Trish Keenan minus a bit of je ne sais quoi. The propellant at the heart of Blouse is bassist Jacob Portrait, who also plays with Portland psych-poppers Unknown Mortal Orchestra: His steady pulse gives the songs just enough oomph to keep them from getting lost in their own gloom. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Blouse aren't out to deconstruct 1980s pop so much as dutifully replicate its essence. It's an easy thing to do wrong, but Blouse find success by not overreaching their grasp. It's beside the point to fault a record like this for not being innovative; by the end of this stretch of songs, there's something almost noble about their poker-faced commitment to time travel. There are a few moments when all the backward glancing becomes a bit heavy-handed, but in their most inspired moments, Blouse find the connection between the limits of outdated technology and the terrible bliss of desiring something impermanent. (In one song Hilton's idea of fun is watching a lone blackbird perched on a telephone wire, ""Just long enough to notice when he flies away/ Because he always flies away."") Blouse aren't just nostalgic for the golden years of MTV pop, but for an entire way of interacting with the world-- for the romance of a time when some things still felt out of reach. ""Videotapes"" finds Hilton longing to see the face of her perennially camera-shy lover. ""What it would be like to see you again,"" she croons, wishing she had a videotape to remind her. That this sentiment feels like such an anachronism in a culture satiated by instant gratification only makes the track more heartbreaking. Blouse harkens back to love in the time before GPS to mine an enduring truth of pop music: getting lost has always sounded good.","Unlike many of their contemporaries, this Unknown Mortal Orchestra-associated Portland dream-pop trio aren't out to deconstruct 1980s pop so much as dutifully replicate its essence.

Ceremonials,Florence and the Machine,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f5ea9e61561daa6863/1:1/w_160/782ca7d9.jpg,2011-11-03 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/,Universal Republic,"When I first saw Florence and the Machine two years ago at New York's cozy and beloved Bowery Ballroom, leader Florence Welch's voice was simply too loud for the room. She sounded massive, but shrill. Overpowering. If the show took place in an X-Men movie, the wind gushing from Welch's lungs would have propelled several patrons smashing through the Bowery's back window onto Delancey Street. The next time I encountered That Voice, it was five months later, in the relatively gigantic Terminal 5 on Manhattan's far west side. And while that venue is often knocked for its booming, detail-abolishing acoustics, and concrete-slab atmosphere, it was a much better fit for Welch, who hopped, ran, and wailed while 3,000 giddy fans looked on, awestruck. For this band and this singer, nothing could be too big. Or so it seemed. Growing up, Welch was met with stern eyes when she was caught singing her favorite hymns with a bit too much verve. Her unbridled talent is the type of thing producers of TV singing contests fantasize about. It's soulful. It's instant. It's blaring. On ""American Idol"", contestants like Welch are invariably deemed ""quirky"" and doomed to runner-up status. And though Welch is a more convincing Artist than even the best ""Idol"" has to offer, make no mistake that her voice-first delivery is perfectly tailored for a generation who grew up judging singers as much as they listened to them. Even the hopelessly hip crowd that showed up to see Welch at Vice's Creators Project event last month saved one of their biggest ovations for the moment when she held out one piercing note for an exaggerated period of time-- a primal sign of skill that banks on nothing less than sheer audacity. The same can be said of Florence and the Machine's second album, Ceremonials, which can feel like Welch simply holding out a single note at top volume for an hour. On paper, the album takes a wise path. After trying out a few different producers and styles-- garage-pop; vampy twinkle-pop; and tribal, mystic-pop-- on her debut, Lungs, Welch settles almost exclusively on the latter for Ceremonials, bringing along producer Paul Epworth, who was so good at the mystic stuff on the first record, to oversee the whole thing. So what we get is Florence trying very hard to top the gargantuan drums and cascading harps and chest-thumping choruses of Lungs hits like ""Cosmic Love"" and ""Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)"" on damn near every song. Instead of Lungs' largely charming yet discombobulating diversity, Ceremonials suffers from a repetitiveness that's akin to looking at a skyline filled with 100-story behemoths lined-up one after the other, blocking out everything but their own size. Some of these world wonders stand tall despite their surroundings. First single ""Shake It Out"", a stadium-willing anthem about getting past one's troubles, sets a new high for this group. As does the similarly barreling ""No Light, No Light"", which is one of the few tracks where Welch sets aside her usual flighty, dreamy, goth-y lyrical go-to's-- ghosts, graveyards, devils, angels, myths, drowning-- for something a bit more personal. ""Would you leave me, if I told you what I'd become,"" she sings during the track's magisterial bridge, ""'Cause it's so easy to sing it to a crowd/ But it's so hard, my love/ To say it to you out loud."" The lines double as a snippet of self-criticism; perhaps Welch finds it ""so easy"" to sing her tunes to thousands because they often lack an individual touch that could send them even further skyward-- the same touch that comes so naturally to fellow UK chart queen Adele. But by the midway point of the LP, its endless crescendos start bleeding into each other, and the loudness soon tires itself out. The few tracks that deviate from the heavens-broken-open formula hardly curb frustrations. The haughty ""Breaking Down"" could be an outtake from MGMT's career-stalling Congratulations, dirge-y ""Seven Devils"" aims for Beelzebub but is about as haunting as a toddler with a pitchfork. In what's becoming an increasingly annoying problem in this era of iTunes bonus tracks and myriad deluxe editions, it's the extras not included on the proper album that offer reasonable outs for Florence's Big issues. ""Remain Nameless"" replaces the record's corporate-rock drums and overzealous whoosh with an electronic minimalism similar to Welch's pals the xx. The song's allowed to breathe, and is all the better for it. Other bonuses include a few demos of some of the record's huger cuts (and the term ""demo"" is relative here-- these stripped-back tracks are still pristine). Backed by only acoustic instrumentation, we finally hear the creases in Welch's voice that the album whitewashes at every turn. ""I don't want your future, don't need your past/ One bright moment, is all I ask,"" sings Welch on choir-aided closer ""Leave My Body"". Ceremonials is so hell-bent on providing such ""bright moments""-- that flash of overwhelming emotion resulting from ramped-up strings or a frantic harp or a particularly audacious vocal run-- that it never zooms out to consider its own listenability. Welch is 25, and she's likely chuffed at the thought of bringing these massive songs to equally immense crowds at festivals all over the world for the next two years. And that's where many of these tracks will have the greatest chance to thrive-- in the open, with heads as far as one can see. On record, though, too much is crushed by blind ambition.","On her band's second album, it can feel like Florence Welch is simply holding out a single note at top volume for an hour. Instead of Lungs' charming, discombobulating diversity, Ceremonials suffers from repetitiveness. The few tracks that do deviate from the heaven's-crescendo formula hardly curb frustrations.

Some Motherfuckers Gonna Be Walking 'Round With a Size 9 Diehard up Their Ass...,Weird Wives,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e3c0084474cd0c1eac/1:1/w_160/defbad46.jpg,2011-11-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15989-some-motherfuckers-gonna-be-walking-round-with-a-size-9-diehard-up-their-ass-cause-apparently-they-aint-never-seen-a-short-ac-man-get-bad-ass-on-methadone/,West Palm Beotch,"A couple of dudes from Surfer Blood have an abrasive, noise-rock side project? Of course a couple of dudes from Surfer Blood have an abrasive, noise-rock side project: while Astro Coast derived much of its strength from mastering a very narrow set of alt/indie touchstones-- Pavement, Weezer, Built to Spill, all ca. 1994-- you had to figure such intense focus was a conscious choice to hide their freak flags rather than hard evidence that they didn't have any to begin with. The funny thing about Weird Wives-- which includes SB guitarist Thomas Fekete, bassist Brian Black, and former tour percussionist Marcos Marchesani-- is that they don't really have to travel all that far to get to the grimier confines of Some Motherfuckers Gonna Be Walking 'Round With a Size 9 Diehard up Their Ass, Cause Apparently They Ain't Never Seen a Short AC Man Get Bad Ass on Methadone. Just turn the radio dial a little to the left from your mainstream alt-rock station or wait out the next the commercial break of ""120 Minutes"" for the likes of the Jesus Lizard or Butthole Surfers to make their brief flirtations with mainstream attention. Surely, Weird Wives' hearts are in the right place here, but Some Motherfuckers turns out to be the kind of record where you can see where its creators' interests lie and, unfortunately, where their expertise does as well. At the very least, this isn't some sort of bid to totally negate Surfer Blood's populist charm for acceptance from the academics and arm-crossers. Everything from the album title to Weird Wives' website to the cover art and the names of most of the songs themselves (""Fresca"", ""Predator 4""), and… well, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a chillwave record. At some points, it sorta is: Instrumentals ""Alone Times"" and ""Peak Commute"" feature the kind of drippy, amniotic keyboard textures signifying a greyscale rendering of Black Moth Super Rainbow. And for the most part, Weird Wives maintain a loose grind, most of Some Motherfuckers cycling through a four-bar pivot where the band locked in and decided to turn it into a four-minute jam. But while there's plenty of feedback splatter, drone, and flatted-fifth skronk, what Weird Wives lack above all else is a sense of true aggression or purpose. Or at least some impression of danger: this is the sort of thing that works best when something feels like it's at stake, whether it's a show that's verging on police intervention or the sonic excavation of an ugly, malignant tumor that simply couldn't stay inside of its host. Hell, maybe this slays live, and their earlier singles did show some fangs, but Weird Wives' brute force runs up against reverb that deadens Some Motherfuckers like so much pink, puffy insulation. The occasional hook does exist-- the fretboard-corroding riff of ""Plastic Masks"", the headbanger repetition driving ""Michaels"", and heck, the grotty, downstroking post-punk of ""Predator 4"" recalls an ornery Interpol jacked on truckstop coffee or speed. But they're only hooky within the context of Some Motherfuckers. Of course, melody isn't paramount in this realm, and you could troubleshoot in the form of a compelling frontman, but Nick Klein (a Weird Wife not from Surfer Blood) sounds uncertain that he's even up for the job. His megaphone yawps blend in just fine with the surrounding sheet-metal timbres, and the occasional lyric you can make out-- ""building new homes"" on ""Gila"", ""It's gonna be one of those nights again"" on ""Predator 4""-- don't really accumulate much tension out of their repetition and instead just sit as vaguely ominous placeholders. But how much of Some Motherfuckers itself is supposed to be a vaguely ominous placeholder instead of a definitive statement from a popular band's side project? That's tougher to parse-- it's easy to understand why Weird Wives felt the desire to make a record like Some Motherfuckers, less so to understand why they felt the need to share it.","Surfer Blood's abrasive, noise-rock side project offers plenty of feedback splatter, drone, and flatted-fifth skronk but lacks a sense of true aggression or purpose.

The Clearing,Locrian,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1eeea9e61561daa6854/1:1/w_160/75f534a2.jpeg,2011-11-02 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15997-the-clearing/,Fan Death,"Plenty of bands play music that sounds dark, but few can make every note bleed black and breathe smoke. Count Locrian as part of that select circle. Something about the Chicago trio's sound is inherently ominous-- it's hard to imagine them playing ""Chopsticks"" without turning it into an earth-threatening thunderstorm. That effect is obvious in their noisier, more chaotic moments, where metallic noise and intense howls coalesce into scary crescendos. But it's just as strong in their quieter, more ambient stretches, when they build tension not from heightened climax but from sustained nuance. The Clearing could be Locrian's most nuanced record so far. Throughout, they use slow, far-off sounds rather in-your-face noise to thicken the atmosphere. A frozen piano line, distant drum roll, or shadowy bass loop is often all the group needs to forge a palpable mood. More than half of the side-long, album-closing title track is made of such minimal material. Yet somehow the band mines it for 17 minutes of sonic pressure. When the song eventually swells into a gnarled thatch of static and low end, Locrian sound less like a group gaining momentum than a mountain rising up through the ocean after years of rumbling below the surface. There are more covert moments of tension on The Clearing, and they're pretty powerful, too. Most pulverizing is ""Augury in an Evaporating Tower"", whose mix of tones showcases the band's agility. At points, the cascading drums and elongated screams conjure Prurient screamer Dominick Fernow's black metal band Ash Pool. But the band deftly shifts to oscillating drone and sky-seeking guitar that sound like Earth's Dylan Carlson battling a synth monster. ""Chalk Point"", on the other hand, takes a more traditional path to its climax, building piano chords into a kind of post-rock metal dirge. Still, what impresses most about The Clearing is not specific turns or isolated moments, but the overwhelming mood it creates. That's what makes the album title apt-- Locrian's dark atmospheres aren't empty spaces, but stark traces of something that was there not long before. In other words, they're as good at creating negative spaces as they are at filling them in. Even when they get so subdued that they approach silence, you can hear ghosts echoing in their void.","Count Chicago trio Locrian among the few bands who not only play music that sounds dark, but also make every note bleed black and breathe smoke.

Meçhul: Singles & Rarities,Erkin Koray,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ec13d197565213a6b3/1:1/w_160/f4ea5f91.jpg,2011-11-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15994-mechul-singles-rarities/,Sublime Frequencies,"It's pretty common for English-speaking critics to refer to Erkin Koray as the ""Turkish Jimi Hendrix."" Obviously, there are reasons this has caught on as the party line, but I want to be careful about picking apart the reasons the comparison is accurate, as well as the ways it's not. Direct comparisons between their music aren't much use. Hendrix was coming from a background in blues and R&B; Koray was a co-founder of Turkey's first (as far as we know) rock band in 1957, but from his home in Istanbul he didn't have to look too far to the east to find a host of interesting sounds to combine with rock'n'roll. I think the comparison, more than anything, ultimately has more to do with Koray's impact on the use of the electric guitar in Turkish popular music than it does with any similarity in their music. And in that sense, the comparison holds some water. Koray's use of the guitar had a profound effect on the way the instrument's role was perceived by his fellow musicians. His use of effects and his deft playing were pioneering, and he was one of the first handful of musicians to actively push for the integration of Turkish folk sounds with rock and psychedelia, even going so far as to electrify the bağlama, a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. From 1965 to 1968, the national Turkish newspaper Hürriyet organized annual contests called Altin Mikrofon (Golden Microphone) with a set of simple rules that did much to create a distinctively Turkish style of rock: Contest entrants had to either compose new songs in Turkish or cover a traditional song, but the arrangements had to be in a rock style, played on Western electric instruments. It's a strange, top-down way of creating a scene, but it worked, and Koray was among the many musicians whose music evolved through entering the contest. Sublime Frequencies' Me**çhul: Singles & Rarities compilation picks up a couple of years after his last Altin Mikrofon entry, after he'd really honed his style and come into his own as a composer and arranger. The title is a giveaway that there's little in the way of an organizing principle behind the set-- the compilers essentially chose a smattering of Koray songs from the 1970s that they really liked, with no eye toward telling a coherent story about his career. That said, they did pick very well, and nearly every track is a killer. For a good glimpse of Koray's singular ethno-rock style, it's hard to beat 1970's ""Gün Doğmuyor"" (""No More Daybreak""). Koray's guitar part, accented by audibly snapping spring reverb is prettily melodic, but his softly sung vocal melody has hints of modal Turkish folk-- Koray clearly was feeling the influence of early progressive rock, too, and you can hear it in the dramatic double stops at the beginning of the refrain. The ethnic element grew stronger with time. On 1977's ""Olmayınca Olmuyor"", Koray's electrified bağlama has supplanted the guitar, and the music has a thrilling progressive folk thrust to it that still sounds strangely modern. Some of it is a little more directly relatable to American and British rock. ""Krallar"" sounds a little like the Amboy Dukes' ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"", for example, but for each of those, there are two ""Goca Dünya""'s, where Koray plays his guitar in a style directly influenced by traditional saz and bağlama players. In part thanks to the lasting effects of the Altin Mikrofon contest, exploring Turkish rock constantly reveals startling juxtapositions and unique sounds, and Koray's music is rich with such moments. If you're looking for an entry point into the world of Anatolian rock, he's an excellent place to start, and this compilation, so well-stocked with great songs and good playing, is good introduction, even if it doesn't approach his career systematically.","Erkin Koray's impact on the use of the electric guitar in Turkish popular music has led him to be labelled the ""Turkish Jimi Hendrix.""

Without You,King Midas Sound,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ceb1335d7bf169a33e/1:1/w_160/fbe51890.jpeg,2011-11-02 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15975-king-midas-sound-without-you/,Hyperdub,"For all its eerie qualities as a work of music, King Midas Sound's Waiting for You was just as striking in spatial terms-- bass throbs, snare hits, and voices, usually broodingly quiet or tautly fretful, reverberating in sonic dub chambers that practically dwarfed them a thousandfold. With all that room, there's plenty of scope to rebuild things, rearrange the elements, and see how the angles of all those deep echoes change. Dabrye's 2008 chrome-and-neon g-funk remix of ""One Ting"" was one of the earliest reinterpretations of Kevin Martin and Roger Robinson's collaborative efforts, and possibly the best to date. But it also shared space on the ""Cool Out"" b-side with Flying Lotus' twitchy, boiling-water mutation of ""Lost""-- a remix just as eager to coax out the ghostly elements of Robinson's voice, but approaching it more like a counterpoint than a complement. Both cuts appear on Without You, a remix album that largely pulls off the rare feat of adding to its source material's mystique without necessarily displacing it. It's not really a track-by-track revisit, and there's a deep focus on some songs in particular-- like the Kiki Hitomi feature ""Goodbye Girl"", which gets three different reinterpretations from three different remixers. (And that's on the digital/CD version; the 2xLP has five.) But while the versions spring from the same source material, and they all preserve the source track's heartbroken bitterness, it's all to different ends. Take note of Jamie Vex'd's rework under his Kuedo alias, which pares back and pitches up Robinson's voice to put more attention on Hitomi's sharp-edged purr, and ramps up the drums while turning the backing track into a borderline-gothic drone. Put it next to the Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe rework, and that only makes the latter track's ambient bent sound that much more austere and suspenseful, like the noise of an abandoned space station. And there's still room for Echospace's all-analog reassemblage, which streamlines near-subliminal rumbles of the vocal track into an ultra-dense, bass-heavy yet still billowy minimal house groove. It's easy to lose track of things with this multiple-version lineup. Gang Gang Dance and Mala take turns shifting the foreboding environmental-crisis warnings of ""Earth a Kill Ya"" into opposite avenues, the former constructing a hiccupy bionic junkshop skank rhythm around it while the latter drops propulsive, bongo-driven vintage dubstep breaks into the original track's once-austere surroundings. And the other take on ""Lost"" besides FlyLo's belongs to Nite Jewel, and her sun-bleached electro-pop is enriched enough by Robinson's voice to defy any chillwitch dreamhouse associations you could throw at it. And yet all these reworks and revisions stay in the general vicinity of the original album's tone of massive yet starkly open spaces, adding a few new facets but always staying close to the fine line Waiting for You treaded between bleak and euphoric. The other trick is to scatter in some revoices along with the remixes, with different singers and vocal tracks versioning dubs of the original Martin productions. ""Spin Me Around"" is the most revelatory, as Cooly G uses the 100-story-high swoon of ""Meltdown"" to lay down what is more or less a straight-up R&B vocal-- and a knockout at that, love-stoned and out of her own mind with ecstasy. And D-bridge's title-track revoice of ""Without You"" matches Robinson's rich yet vulnerable precedent with a resonantly fragile deep house-indebted vocal lead of his own. Others feel a bit more dispensable: there's some attention-getting restrained intensity in Hitomi's voice in her takeover of ""Cool Out"" on ""Tears"", but it's more of a pleasant variation on the original's lover's-rock bliss than a bonafide transformation. And revoices featuring Ford & Lopatin's Joel Ford (""Say Something"") and Scritti Politti's Green Gartside (""Come and Behold"") sound a bit too bright and upbeat, getting a bit  at-odds with the original deep-dub atmosphere to click as strongly as the others. No matter-- there's still plenty of room for them.","For all its eerie qualities, King Midas Sound's Waiting for You was just as striking in spatial terms.

The Smile Sessions,The Beach Boys,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f313d197565213a6b7/1:1/w_160/4befca87.jpeg,2011-11-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/,Capitol,"It's a rite of passage for students of pop music history: At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. The record that convinces most is Pet Sounds, that understated 1966 masterpiece that articulates a specific kind of teenage longing and loneliness like nothing before or since. Once you've absorbed that record, you find yourself going back through songs like ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""The Warmth of the Sun"", and ""I Get Around"", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship. As you make these discoveries, you come to learn about the auteur at the center of it all, Brian Wilson, who shouldered the burden of being the creative force in one of the most successful and musically ambitious pop bands of the era. And then you find out about SMiLE. Conceived, recorded, and ultimately abandoned in 1966 and 1967, SMiLE was to be something like Brian's Sgt. Pepper's, his attempt to make the great art-pop album of the era. He followed his muse to the ends of the earth, putting a grand piano in a massive living room sandbox, outfitting another room with an Arabian tent, making session musicians wear fireman's hats for the recording of a song about the elements, freaking out when an actual fire broke out down the street from the studio around the time of recording of said track, and, no surprise, taking enough drugs to amplify the whole scene and turn it into something terrifying. But the record was not to be. The music recorded for SMiLE was too far-out for the rest of the band (lead singer Mike Love hated the lyrics penned by Wilson's collaborator, Van Dyke Parks, an opinion he still holds) and Wilson had trouble finishing tracks. Eventually, he shelved the record for good and the band issued the low-key, weird, and supremely stoned Smiley Smile. By setting the record aside, Wilson became afraid to indulge his talent, and his contributions to the Beach Boys would never again be central to the band. If you're wired a certain way, once you learn the SMiLE story, you long to hear the album that never was. It looms out there in imagination, an album that lends itself to storytelling and legend, like the aural equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. And the songs from the sessions that eventually made it out on other records-- ""Surf's Up"", ""Cabin Essence"", ""Heroes and Villains"", and more, including material on the 1993 Beach Boys career-overview box Good Vibrations-- were so brilliant that the lack of proper release becomes almost painful. So you might start hunting down bootlegs, poring over the fragments, and finding competing edits and track sequences, which only feeds your desire to know what the ""real"" SMiLE could have been. Only in 2003, when long-time Beach Boys fanatic and tape trader Darian Sahanaja and his band the Wondermints collaborated with Brian on a live version of SMiLE and 2004's Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE album did the lost record assume a definitive shape. But as exciting as that record was at the time, the lure of the originals never went away. So there was naturally a great deal of excitement when, early this year, we heard that the original tapes were being assembled for official release. This epic story finally has an ending, and it's a very happy one. As archival projects go, SMiLE is as surprising, generous, and successful as anything in recent memory. The version of the album, based on the Wilson/Wondermints sequence, feels remarkably complete and whole, even though it was largely built from unfinished scraps. During this period, Wilson and Parks were working on an enormous canvas. They were using words and music to tell a story of America. If the early-60s Beach Boys were about California, that place where the continent ends and dreams are born, SMiLE is about how those dreams were first conceived. Moving west from Plymouth Rock, we view cornfields and farmland and the Chicago fire and jagged mountains, the Grand Cooley Damn, the California coast-- and we don't stop until we hit Hawaii. Cowboy songs, cartoon Native American chants, barroom rags, jazzy interludes, rock'n'roll, sweeping classical touches, street-corner doo-wop, and town square barbershop quartet are swirled together into an ever-shifting technicolor dream. Befitting an album concerned with history, SMiLE feels strangely adrift from time, using the technology of the day and an avant-garde approach to pop song form to make the past look both familiar and strange. In 1966 and 1967, old-timey music, if you squinted at it just so, could be imbued with a haze of psychedelia. And this is a deeply psychedelic album, though disorientation mostly comes from its juxtapositions, how the orchestral miniatures (or ""feels,"" as Wilson called his modular melodic ideas) bump into each other and find their way from one song to the next, the ""Heroes and Villains"" refrain here, the ""Child Is Father of the Man"" refrain there. The 2004 sequence divided the album into three ""movements,"" with songs connected thematically, and this reissue wisely puts each on its own side of vinyl (if you want only the record proper, the 2xLP, with key outtakes added on the fourth side, is absolutely the way to go). Each movement has at least one pop masterpiece. On the first, there's ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Cabin Essence"", both exploring western themes in Parks' bent style. Here and especially on side two's ""Surf's Up"", the level of Parks' writing is astounding. He had the sound-driven jumble of imagery of contemporaneous Dylan, but his words were far tighter and more disciplined. He also understood the power of a good pun. Sounds are slurred together to take on new meaning through clusters that extended beyond the spaces between the words. So, ""The music hall, a costly bow,"" in ""Surf's Up"" also sounds like, ""The music holocaust,"" and lines like, ""canvas the town and brush the backdrop,"" layer image atop image with breathtaking efficiency. Each side's arc also serves to push forward the record as a whole. Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE has made this sequencing seem canonical, and there were enough raw materials in the vault available to piece together a worthy approximation. Once in a while, you can hear a stitch or shift that would have no doubt been done over later, but those moments are rare and ultimately only add to the record's charm. By the time the tense and throbbing neo-classical piece ""Fire (Mrs. O'Leary's Cow)"" comes along in the third movement and then leads into ""Love to Say Dada"" (mostly an instrumental, it was meant to have lyrics; they were added for Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song titled ""In Blue Hawaii"") and then to the extended ""Good Vibrations"", the strength of the album as a full piece is staggering. But part of the allure of SMiLE will always be the pieces, and the deluxe box has a lot of them. There's almost a full disc of ""Heroes and Villains"" fragments and another entire CD with bits of ""Good Vibrations"". Given the nature of this release, the extras are illuminating, arguably more essential than most outtakes included with bonus albums. Having source materials hints at roads not taken, and also offers insight into the difficulty of actually creating a record on this scale, given how much we've heard about all the bouncing and layering that SMiLE entailed (the complexity of which is partly to blame for the project's being late and ultimately abandoned) and how many of the basic tracks were recorded live in the studio with a dozen or more musicians at once. There were only four and eight tracks to work with on the tape of the time, so one of them would need multiple instruments just to have voices and overdubs added later. Not to mention that these modular sections were eventually going to be stitched together with tape and razorblades. Beyond the fragments, there are brilliant single performances, like the two demo versions of ""Surf's Up"". To my ears, the song is a high-water mark of pop songwriting, positively haunting with its melodic twists and turns. And Brian's vocal performances, with wild leaps into the upper reaches of his falsetto, give the track an almost unbearable poignancy. It's incredible to think that ""Surf's Up"" would remain in the vault for five years, until it appeared in re-worked form on the 1971 album of the same name. On the sessions material, you also get to hear Wilson running the show in the studio, and apart from a few asides where he talks about hash and LSD, he sounds excited, patient, and kind, offering encouragement about mood, timing, and tempo. He surely wasn't an easy guy to work for, but hearing his voice on these tapes, it's remarkable how together he seems and how willing he is to work with these musicians to make something great. Most of all, his studio patter provides a nice counterbalance to SMiLE's prevailing narrative, of a crazed genius unraveling in the face of trying to create his masterpiece. We love crack-up stories. There's something in the Western psyche that loves to romanticize the alleged connection between madness and genius. And someone like Wilson-- fragile, paranoid, childlike, and dreamy-- fits one template of the crazed genius to a T. Never mind that he was a student of music, put in twice as many hours of extremely hard work as anyone else in the band, and relied greatly on collaboration and outside inspiration. When thinking of SMiLE, the guy in the fireman's hat thinking his music could burn down buildings is who we remember. But now we have the full picture. SMiLE was never finished, and it still isn't, but we can safely say this is as close as it'll ever come. What's here is brilliant, beautiful, and, most importantly, finally able to stand tall on its own.","Conceived, recorded, and ultimately abandoned in 1966 and 1967, SMiLE was to be something like Brian Wilson's Sgt.

Nightlife EP,Phantogram,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cf9d034d5c69bf4a97/1:1/w_160/54f0130a.jpg,2011-11-01 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15974-phantogram-nightlife-ep/,Barsuk,"Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter, the New York-based electronic pop duo better known as Phantogram, make music refreshingly disinterested in pulling punches. With Eyelid Movies, their debut full-length from last year, the rhythm-heavy foundations and a twilight-lit mix of melody felt streamlined, yet still demonstrated vision and character. Taking cues from trip-hop and dream pop (Portishead seem to be an important reference point), they never seemed shy about being upfront with their influences. Despite cryptically nicknaming their sound ""street beat,"" the tag made some sense-- the hard-edged urgency of said beats undercutting such lush romanticism felt perfectly suited for those long, late staggers home. So it's with the appropriately titled Nightlife EP that we find the twosome refining and tweaking some of the ideas put forth on its debut without entirely resting on its laurels, and offering a few of the band's best songs to date. In a press release, Carter explained that Nightlife ""couldn't have been written anywhere other than in clubs and hotel rooms during this experience we've been having for the last year or two,"" describing the time Phantogram has spent promoting Eyelid Movies. The nocturnal states that often accompany life on the road have proved beneficial in the case of Nightlife, convincing the duo to push their music outside of their collective headspace and into a more social setting. Bands trying to provide an honest snapshot of a night out on the town often fall short by focusing solely on the highs of the party (those are included here too, of course), but Phantogram seem to find just as much clarity in the comedown (""It's a new day, and I got new ways of turning into stone,"" goes the chorus on ""Turning Into Stone""). As much as you can move to Nightlife, moments of austerity and romance are still guiding lights here-- when measured correctly, Barthel and Carter are often able to craft appealing, ambidextrous tracks that feel suited for dancefloors as well as the backs of cabs. Part of this notably animated reupholstering likely has something to do with that fact that Phantogram have been performing live as a trio, with Tim Oakley handling drum duties. And while Carter is in charge of all things drum-oriented on Nightlife, the temporary change-up clearly made its mark, as Phantogram sounds more like a bonafide rock band and less like the flimsy pop act they could've dissolved into. Take single ""Don't Move"", a dance track that feels perfectly proportioned for starry eyes in close quarters. But look closer, and you'll find a proper heir to Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me-styled bombast, complete with horn clippings, Middle Eastern vocal samples, and marching band drum rolls. And while the Mazzy Star-esque coda that reduces the appealing bass knocks on ""Turning Into Stone"" into something plush and more intimate might not be necessary, it all suggests that this is a more realized pop voice willing to expand, experiment with and reinvigorate their sound. Not everything here is as compelling, but the true takeaways (the first three cuts, including the outsized, life-affirming ""16 Years"") are well worth the misguided ambition and watered down moments that inhabit the EP's second half. Closer ""A Dark Tunnel"" means to shade the buzzing urgency of Return to Cookie Mountain-era TV on the Radio but misses the mark; squint hard enough and you'll see that ""Nightlife"" probably isn't going to succeed in any context outside of a CW show. Unfortunately, this means that, at only six songs, Nightlife's batting average takes a considerable dip. But what remains is good enough to encourage you to root for Phantogram, and to really hold onto those few great tracks that you'll be taking home with you at the end of the night.","On this six-song EP, the New York-based electronic pop duo refine and tweak ideas put forth on their debut, crafting appealing, ambidextrous tracks that feel suited for dancefloors as well as the backs of cabs.

Scion A/V Presents: The King Khan Experience,The King Khan Experience,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d913d197565213a699/1:1/w_160/dbb6de53.jpeg,2011-11-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15980-the-king-khan-experience-scion-av-presents-the-king-khan-experience/,Scion A/V,"Last year, Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson asked the King Khan & BBQ Show to join their curated Vivid Live festival in Sydney alongside Tuvan throat singers, Reed's Metal Machine Trio, and the Blind Boys of Alabama. According to Khan, Reed and Anderson wanted the duo to ""put back the danger into the devil's music."" His antics at the event, which ultimately led to his breakup with Mark Sultan, proved that assessment accurate. His live shows are unpredictable and wild. His music with BBQ, Tandoori Knights, and the Shrines is driven by an energetic, fiery soul that jumps straight out of the 1950s and 1960s-- a time when several of pop music's central characters were handsome, wild-eyed men screaming and pushing that ""devil’s music"" to America's children. King Khan is the same sort of dangerous and then some: He's usually shirtless (in the very least) and he unleashes Wilson Pickett shrieks, exudes grease and sex, and has a knack for being gratuitously crass. That's why this Scion EP by ""the King Khan Experience"" is so disappointing. The palpable feeling of danger from Khan's work never comes into play. Where his material with the Shrines felt like a sharp rock and soul review, the Experience comparatively sags. The Shrines' What Is?! was backed by a tight horn section and some on-point melody-accenting guitars. Meanwhile, the Experience features organ and poorly utilized horns. Many of the reference points seem to come less from the 60s and more from the indulgent, jammy 70s-- the wandering organ and the loose blues guitar solo of ""Knock Me Off My Feet"" feel sloppy in comparision to past material. What's worse, Khan sounds tired. His vocals frequently drag, and even his ""OWW""'s come off less wild than usual. A few songs hint at the electrifying promise he made with the Shrines, but they ultimately slip up somewhere. The opening guitar and percussion drive of ""Come Levitate With Me"" sound like they're about to build into a party song, but then the song just slows down with a Herbie Mann-ish flute solo and Khan's monotonous, dragging vocals. ""I Got Love"" is the song that begs for horns and speed, but neither happen. The only track that truly hits is his tribute to Jay Reatard: ""Hammer Ich Vermisse Dich"", a German cover of Reatard's ""Hammer I Miss You"". It’s unclear why the song is in German, but through the language barrier, you can hear Khan's passionate delivery. He's backed on the chorus by what sounds like German schoolgirls, and there's glitchy percussion driving the whole thing. It’s a touching tribute to his friend, if only from the titular message: ""I miss you."" Maybe the EP was a place to put out some odds and ends that don't have a clear place with any of his other bands-- it really does sound like a hodgepodge. We get ""Are You Serious?"", a lo-fi goof on Jimi Hendrix's ""The Wind Cries Mary"" and Are You Experienced. (The song might explain the new band name.) He also offers ""Keep It Simple Stupid"", a bit of clichéd Eastern psych with a too-long whine. There is ""Bob Log Stomp"", a track that would fit tidily with BBQ or the Shrines, but it's basically a ""somebody pooped in my scotch"" joke, and it's not even as funny as ""Tastebuds"". Throughout, we get a shadow of Khan as ""wild man"" as joker as rocker. His best work comes from a place that's unhinged. This material's too toned-down and wandering. In ""I Got Love"", he sings: ""It's a question of soul/ Some people got it and some people don't."" This turns out to be a supremely a misplaced lyric on an EP where the man's delivery is so flat.","The feeling of danger from King Khan's best work never comes into play on this Scion EP. Worse, despite a moving cover of Jay Reatard's ""Hammer I Miss You"" (in German!), Khan sounds tired.

Eyes on You EP,Pandr Eyez,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d8b1335d7bf169a34d/1:1/w_160/af0861e0.jpeg,2011-11-01 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15979-pandr-eyez/,Cascine,"Hearing Pandr Eyez for the first time recently on Air France's FACT mix was slightly disarming. That's not to say that this is weird music. It's actually pretty accessible pop music, but something about their song ""Little Bit"" is hard to place. The pitch-perfect execution feels like something you should already know-- a producer retooling a forgotten acapella, maybe, or perhaps a radio cut from a new R&B singer. As it happens neither is exactly true: Pandr Eyez is the work of a London-based duo made up of producer Tom Lloyd and singer Ferren Gipson. The story is that they met while living in a shared university dormitory then started exchanging musical ideas. Something about that enthusiasm and shared love of certain styles carries over into Pandr Eyez, giving the project an infectious, off-the-cuff energy. That, combined with the absence of samples or acapellas, makes Eyes on You feel both homespun and playful in execution, though perhaps a couple of steps away from *""*the real thing."" That lingering feeling makes this seem like more of an outside-looking-in take on R&B, and it's tempting to compare it to the kind of thing jj went in for on their mixtape Kills, but this isn't anywhere near as drugged or sad-eyed. ""Little Bit"" stands out from the rest of their material, with woozy synths and a shuffling beat pushing rhythms in all the right spots. Above that backdrop Gipson buries her verses in rap standards like ""Didn't have too much when we started this game/ Now we're doing alright, check my diamonds and rings."" But lines like those-- and others about brand new kicks, seeing her face on TV, and referencing 16 bars-- sound different coming from what is essentially a bedroom duo rather than guys like 8Ball and MJG. There's an element of dress-up to Gipson's lyrics, and a gooey soft center that isn't quite concealed by the fronting. (It's not a million miles away from the effect of Robyn on ""Konichiwa Bitches"".) A lot of the success of these tracks is centered on feel-good vibes though and the impressive production-- handled by the other half of the duo, Tom Lloyd-- goes a long way toward making the record work so well. His beats are characterized by a dreamy feel thanks to the big, romantic synths on all of these tracks, but there's range to his production too. ""Shinin'"", for example cuts a contrast to the rest of the EP's softer palette gliding, instead, on a minimal, deep rumbling bass pattern and cheap sounding samples. It's a slightly harsh exterior, one that Gipson matches toe-to-toe with bravado. The track really takes off towards the end, though, as Lloyd grabs the spotlight, throwing all those cheap samples in the air and letting them drop around each other. For all their individual nuance and personality, it's clear that the duo have hit a collaborative sweet-spot: Lloyd and Gipson play to each other's strengths and egg each other on at every turn. While there is plenty of recontextualizing rap and R&B going around, the fun of this record is that Pandr Eyez seem to understand that sometimes pop music is just about letting your hair down and singing along in whatever language you can.","While there is plenty of recontextualizing rap and R&B going around, the London-based duo of producer Tom Lloyd and singer Ferren Gipson seems to understand that sometimes pop music is just about letting your hair down and singing along in whatever language you can.

DJ-Kicks,Gold Panda,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e85e6ef959693221df/1:1/w_160/72d41a3e.jpg,2011-11-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15991-gold-panda-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Gold Panda's 2010 debut, Lucky Shiner, asked you to accept a number of seeming contradictions, echoing some of the great contradictory artists of electronic music as it went along. Like the work of Boards of Canada, its emotion-loaded melodies were both whimsical and mournful. Like the collage-funk productions of Matthew Herbert, it built tracks from a myriad of tiny samples, but warped them so that even field recordings and snippets of analog instruments felt denatured, computerized, alien. The production had the crammed-waveform fullness of the Field's fluffy maximalist trance epics, but the way GP put his tracks together from all those little bits somehow also recalled the fragile, handmade miniatures of not-quite-dubsteppers Mount Kimbie. Whether or not GP would claim any or all of those acts as influences or peers, it was clear he was enjoying the same sort of freedom as they did, the freedom of belonging to no one particular electronic music niche. He drew inspiration from sounds as far-flung as the more obvious physicality of London's ever-evolving beats-and-bass subculture, the twitching and gurgling micro-syncopations of experimental techno, and the shameless and affecting melodicism of IDM. More crucially, he also found ways to layer them into something his own. On GP's new DJ-Kicks entry, he attempts to fuse these strands of modern dance, just as he did on Lucky Shiner, except this time using mostly other people's records as raw material. The result is another seeming contradiction, a DJ mix that's both a pulsing paean to up-to-the-minute club rhythms and a total headphone-dependent feast of electronic sound at its most miniaturized and luscious. He does this quite simply, pairing left-field bangers with tracks that tend more toward the art-techno end of the spectrum, accentuating the subtleties of the former and teasing out the grooves in the latter. And in the mix's most effective moments, he mingles them until they create new hybrids, not quite dancefloor ready and always with so much to listen to that you could never call them ambient. GP draws out the strange staggering gait of Bok Bok's ""Charisma Theme"", what might have seemed like a slab of party-ready bashing and clonking in a mix of similar post-dubstep party tunes, by linking it with the more steely, abstract electro of Decay's ""Charisma's Theme"". He hears a bit of gnarled drums and synthesizer murk, clipped from a Brainiac record of all things, as the perfect perverse segue into Untold and LV's spartan dubstep. He ranges as far as he ever has on his own records, from Berlin minimal to American indie rock, divining brilliant connections between artists who seem to come from opposing aesthetic universes. Amazingly, this rarely makes for choppy transitions. Given the wildly disparate materials used to construct it, the bubbling, slurping, rustling flow of this DJ-Kicks is a marvel, the kind of seamless weaving together of tiny sounds into a new tapestry that's been sadly unfashionable since the days of old-school micro-house mixes. And like vintage micro-house, many of the tracks take minimalism not as an opportunity for acetic reduction but a chance to revel in all the ear candy sound-as-sound qualities of electronic music, without totally skimping on the funk. Tune your ears down to its reductionist frequency, and the vinyl-esque crackle and barely audible hiss of Jan Jelinek's ""If's, And's, and But's"" feels as lush and wombing as any massive, bass-booming deep house jam operating on a similarly warm tip. Like the records that make it up, Gold Panda's DJ-Kicks is too interested in these (often literally) small pleasures and subtle entwinings to say it demands your attention. But in his own dogged, idiosyncratic way, he's keeping a neglected strain of dance music alive here, and while the joys are subtle, the more attention you give the mix, the deeper they feel.","Seamlessly weaving disparate strands of modern dance music, this mix is a pulsing paean to up-to-the-minute club rhythms as well as a headphone-dependent feast of electronic sound at its most miniaturized and luscious.

Lulu,MetallicaLou Reed,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e6ea9e61561daa6843/1:1/w_160/001133e9.jpg,2011-11-01 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/,Warner Bros.,"When Metallica announced last June that they had recorded a new album with Lou Reed, fans of both artists responded with confusion, if not outright despair. But while this partnership may seem random, the two actually have a lot in common. Both abuse electric guitars; both like to wear black and be photographed by Anton Corbijn; both have indulged in lifestyles that threatened to become death-styles; both have a habit of alienating their fans by taking ill-advised stylistic detours and, by extension, both are considered by many to be class-A assholes. But while these surface similarities may provide the two parties with small-talk/commiseration fodder when, say, hanging backstage before murdering ""Sweet Jane"" at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, they're pretty miserable grounds for a full-on collaboration, especially one that spans two discs and close to 90 minutes. And yet, showing their usual proud disregard for their fans and music in general, Lou Reed and Metallica have gone and made Lulu anyway. It'd be one thing if Lulu were being slipped into the marketplace as a low-profile curiosity, akin to a 90s-era spoken word album with some alt-rocker screeching away in the background. Instead, it's being trumpeted by its makers as a historic event. In a now-infamous interview, James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich recall bursting into tears of pride during the recording sessions, while in another Reed grinningly insists that Metallica has ""pushed me to the best I've ever been."" It was one of many unintentional jokes in an online promo campaign that effectively ruined Lulu's chances of being taken seriously before it was even heard. Lulu was first previewed with an especially repellent 30-second tract of ""The View"" that confirmed everyone's worst suspicions of the project-- namely, that Reed's crotchety, atonal poem-rants would be wholly incompatible with Metallica's fidgety riffage. The clip's most prominent lyric (""Throw it away/ For worship someone who actively despises you!"") seemed to mock both artists' most forgiving fans for even clicking on the link. By the time ""The View"" was released in its full, five-minute ghastliness-- with Hetfield variously professing himself to be a table, a 10-story building and, possibly, the premier member of Philly hip-hop band the Roots-- the Internet had all the evidence it needed to preemptively crown Lulu the Worst Album of All Time. But even in that regard, Lulu disappoints. For all the hilarity that ought to ensue here, Lulu is a frustratingly noble failure. Audacious to the extreme, but exhaustingly tedious as a result, its few interesting ideas are stretched out beyond the point of utility and pounded into submission-- the average song length clocks in at eight excruciating minutes. Still, it's kind of fascinating to hear two veteran entities trying like hell to excavate common ground that simply does not exist. Lulu's source material-- a series of transgressive plays by Munich playwright Frank Wedekind about a stripper who becomes a social-climber only to wind up a prostitute-- allows Reed to set a familiar Berlin scene with ""Brandenburg Gate"", a would-be anthem that, with a less torturous delivery, could almost pass for something from Reed's mid-1970s songbook. Instead, we get Hetfield belting out its ""small town girl"" chorus like he's trying to summon the next featured attraction at a strip club. Reed's influence also feels responsible for the ominous, omnipresent Velvets-esque string textures and a couple of curiously avant guitar solos from Kirk Hammett (see: ""Dragon""). Metallica, meanwhile, inspired Reed to come up with at least one perfectly metal lyric (""I cry icicles in my stein""), while getting him to update the S&M suggestiveness of ""Venus in Furs"" to the bloodlusty standards of the modern-day headbanger. However, a great deal of Lulu's songs find Reed graphically describing violent, depraved sexual trysts from the female protagonist's perspective, and with lines like ""I will swallow your sharpest cutter like a colored's man dick"" in abundance, some dyed-in-the-denim Metallica fans could be squirming like they did when Kirk started wearing eyeliner. Unfortunately, these small surprises can't save Lulu from the much larger issue that lies directly at its core: For most of the record, Lou Reed and Metallica barely sound like they're on the same planet, let alone in the same room; the album works neither as powerful rock music nor as an impressionistic soundtrack to a spoken narrative. Reed's monotone remains unresponsive to what's happening around him whether the occasion calls for full-torque thrash (""Mistress Dread"") or dreary acoustic mood pieces (""Little Dog""), while Lars Ulrich's flailing fills during the breakdowns on ""Pumping Blood"" and ""Frustration"" are essentially drummerese for ""what the fuck do I do with this?"" But for all of Reed's meandering, a-melodic verbosity, it's actually Hetfield who sounds the most out of place here; beyond his self-parodic turn on ""The View"", he contributes intrusive back-ups to the bar-band slog ""Iced Honey"" and the maddeningly repetitious ""Cheat on Me"" like someone in the back row of a class photo trying to mug his way into the frame. Remarkably, there is actually a light at the end of this dark, despairing tunnel-- and, not coincidentally, it's the song least connected to the Lulu concept. Clocking in at an absurd 19 minutes, ""Junior Dad"" is-- like almost everything else here-- too long by half, with its last eight minutes taken up by an extended string drone. But, despite its laughable title, ""Junior Dad"" possesses everything the rest of Lulu doesn't: a graceful, affecting melody, a logical arrangement, a pretty guitar line, a sympathetic narrator and, most importantly, a true synthesis of each principal's strengths, outfitting a Reed streetwise hymn with Metallica's stadium-sized crunch; it's like ""Street Hassle"" refashioned as a Black Album power ballad. ""Junior Dad"" is a song that seemingly does the impossible: it momentarily redeems the idea of a Lou Reed/Metallica collaboration as a plausible, potentially fruitful concept. But its late appearance also serves as a potent reminder of just how terribly that concept is executed on everything that precedes it.","Lou Reed and Metallica's collaborative album based on German playwright Frank Wedekind's plays about a social-climber-turned-prostitute has been preemptively crowned ""The Worst Album of All Time.""

Neon Dreams,L-Vis 1990,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1de9d034d5c69bf4ab3/1:1/w_160/ec194eeb.jpeg,2011-10-31 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15982-neon-dreams/,Night SlugsPMR,"An interesting thing about the Night Slugs label is that it's managed to maintain ""Next Big Thing"" status over the past couple of years without ever really defining what it's about. The London imprint, partly known for launching bass hotshots Kingdom and Girl Unit, employs stylistically diverse artists, and there's never been a convenient tag like ""purple"" or ""rave-house"" to pin on them. Label founders L-Vis 1990 and Bok Bok even stress this in interviews. ""We've always hated any genre associations with our music and I think it's pretty impossible to label it, it's just held together by a vibe,"" the former said a little ways back. This slipperiness has served Night Slugs well, but at a certain point you want something a little more concrete-- what is that vibe, exactly? Neon Dreams, the solo debut from L-Vis 1990 (real name James Connolly) does not answer this question. If Night Slugs' loose guiding principle up until now has been a colorful counterweight to dubstep and grime's murk and grit, Neon Dreams spins that idea in a hundred different directions. The record is (sometimes intriguingly, often frustratingly) all over the place. The starting point, though, seems to be pop. From the album title and M83-esque cover art to the use of guest vocalists, it's clear that Connolly is interested in making songs rather than just club tracks. And sometimes he does this really well. On ""Tonight"", for example, he throws some 1980s radio sheen on stuttery disco-house and winds up with catchy, retro-futurist boogie. ""Play It Cool"", arguably the best song here, also fits into this pop mode. Gooey synths, heavy drama, breathy female vocals-- it nails a very specific kind of dark and dreamy electro-pop. (Worth noting that it fits comfortably alongside such 2011 standouts as the aforementioned M83, Neon Indian's Era Extraña, and the Drive soundtrack.) If Connolly had extended this format (or even this vibe) throughout the album, the rest of it may have been as successful, but instead he incorporates so, so many other sounds. There's a different style on almost every track. You've got a quirky, Chromeo-style one, some brooding instrumental ones, one where a dude talks quasi-motivationally over revved up Chicago house, and so forth. None of these tracks are particularly bad; it's simply a case of too much. Too many songs with varying themes and no overarching vision to tie them together. It feels more like taking in a label compilation where you're hopping from one artist's style to the next, and even if that were the case I'd still probably say the sequencing is off. But it's possible that this is precisely Connolly's point-- to make something boundary-less and genre-agnostic, in line with the anything-goes Night Slugs ideology. Bass music, after all, is an ever-evolving thing, generating new sub-strains as fast as you can count them, and this corrals a bunch in one place. Still, offer a bunch of diversions instead of a clear path, and folks might get lost along the way.","The solo debut from Night Slugs co-founder L-Vis 1990, aka James Connolly, is-- sometimes intriguingly, often frustratingly-- all over the place.

Total Decay EP,The Soft Moon,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e25e6ef959693221d3/1:1/w_160/5c450014.jpeg,2011-10-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15988-total-decay-ep/,Captured Tracks,"Luis Vasquez works alone, and it shows. Excluding live performances, the San Francisco musician sets and triggers every sound associated with the Soft Moon, drawing from the coldest, most metallic zeniths of post-punk and industrial rock. He builds isolation out of isolation, almost to the point that he's entirely removed as a presence; when he sings, he's less a personality than an instrument in the mix, hissing and howling like busted pipes in an abandoned factory. The work collected on the Soft Moon's self-titled LP from last year, as well as this year's follow-up EP, Total Decay, are singular and self-contained, like nightmares. A typical piece starts suddenly and without warning, and ends with equal subtlety, like someone flipping off a light switch (or, given the music's dark antagonism, turning it on). Even though there are other acts in the Bay Area that enjoy their share of ear-bleeding noise (Weekend, Thee Oh Sees if you catch them at the right moment), don't bother trying to place Vasquez amidst the area's growing circle of visible indie musicians. He's working in a class of his own. Notice that I haven't used the word ""songs"" to describe the result of Vasquez's creative process. That's because the Soft Moon aren't really about ""songs,"" per se; they're about moods, how they're conveyed, and the specific images they conjure. On The Soft Moon, the titles ascribed to the music were all the lyrics one needed (and, more often than not, was given), and that practice continues on Total Decay. Besides sounding like Joy Division and bearing the name of what sounds like a potential Joy Division song title, the most notable element of ""Repetition"" is its-- you guessed it-- repeating bassline, sinisterly gyrating in place while whimpered buzzing and oscillating machines rise and fall around it. The title track's zombie-eyed buzzsaws sound like the aural equivalent of having your skin slowly ripped off, while ""Visions"" takes a feral drum circle and throws space-disco drum machines into the mix, a combo queasy enough to make even the steeliest soothsayer run from the opium den, hopelessly choking back vomit. Needless to say, this isn't the type of immediate, accessible stuff that casual observers might expect from Captured Tracks, a label that stakes its chips as much on M.O.R. indie-pop like Beach Fossils as on chilly synths and brutal coldwave (although they've been focusing a lot more on the latter in the last 12 months). When Vasquez decides to create something like an actual song, though, the results are undeniable. ""When It's Over"", a highlight from The Soft Moon, smoldered with sexual confusion and the allure of 4AD's shoegaze glory days; here, it's the title track that burns brightest, a mass-murderer of an anti-anthem that features Vasquez front and (kind of) center, eliciting a high-pitched whine delivered with terrifying slowness amidst the track's hurtling, noisebombing destruction. There's an urge to compare ""Total Decay"" to Nine Inch Nails, but there's no angst or frustrated feelings to be found here-- just emptiness, and whatever baggage you bring along with you. If Total Decay's composition amounted to the spoils of its title track repeated four times over, it'd simply be too much, which highlights Vasquez's ability to conjure different sounds and styles track-by-track. However, that fact also points out how the Soft Moon's brand of cold, nocturnal malevolence works best in small smatterings. At first, I found myself underwhelmed by Total Decay, because I wanted more than what amounts to 14 minutes of new material following the promise of The Soft Moon; over time, though, I came to realize that the EP's controlled-dosage brevity is exactly what makes it rise above its predecessor. It's short and intense, and accordingly it hits hard and leaves enough of a lasting bruise on you that you can't help but touch it, just to feel the pain again.","San Francisco's Luis Vasquez returns with another collection drawing from the coldest, most metallic zeniths of post-punk and industrial rock. The EP's intense, controlled-dosage brevity helps it rise above last year's self-titled debut.

17th Street,Hammers of Misfortune,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e513d197565213a6a8/1:1/w_160/c7c30751.jpg,2011-10-31 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15990-17th-street/,Metal Blade,"Hammers of Misfortune's fifth album, 17th Street, is a song cycle about ""loss and endings,"" though it sounds like a series of new beginnings. For starters, guitarist/lyricist/songwriter John Cobbett-- of recently disbanded SF black metal group Ludicra and onetime member of comrades-in-classic-metal/sister band Slough Feg-- has again retooled his rotating cast: Longtime drummer Chewy Marzolo returns, as do more recent additions Sigrid Sheie (organ) and Max Barnett (bass), but this is the first HoM album to feature guitarist Leila Abdul-Rauf (Saros, Amber Asylum, Vastum) and power-piped vocalist Joe Hutton (the Worship of Silence). The band, which debuted in 2001 with the three-part rock opera The Bastard, have never shied from ambition. When I spoke with Cobbett in 2008, he said HoM's 2003 sophomore collection The August Engine was his ""first attempt"" to make an album as big as The Wall. 2008's sprawling Fields/Church of Broken Glass, two individual concept albums packaged together, was his second. But the music Cobbett writes is detailed enough that he doesn't need to fill four sides of vinyl to make his point. He's finally figured that out on 17th Street. At a time when fans can get caught-up on how fast someone solos, or how ominous a back story they have to offer, HoM shake aside gimmicks and play classic progressive metal in a way that makes room for thrash, doom, NWOBHM, and legit hooks alongside honest feeling and larger concepts. Cobbett didn't spell out the specifics in the record's accompanying press materials; his songwriting and lyrics are evocative enough that it isn't necessary. These are songs about gentrification (in his hometown and elsewhere), paeans to areas of San Francisco, and stories about individuals living out their lives in those spaces-- though it's easy to ignore all of that and just go along for the air-guitaring. Cobbett's said working with Abdul-Rauf got him to return to writing songs for the electric guitar, a claim consistently backed up by this record's incredibly emotive, vintage riffs. On opener ""317"", guitars entangle with a swaggering, synchronized momentum until one spirals out like the album cover's splayed lights of San Francisco. Two and a half minutes of instrumental music pass before Hutton gets all Walt Whitman with it: ""We are the soil becoming dust/ We are the chrome becoming rust,"" etc. But even without the voice, the song's plenty expressive. It's followed by the the speedier, punchier ""17th Street"" with its doubled female harmonies, slick (then crunchy) guitars, and spacious organ. Lyrically, it's a focused study of a ""ruthless"" street outside a window (in, what you expect, is any city, anywhere), reminiscent of William T. Vollmann's descriptions of the Tenderloin district. Musically, it gallops, but maintains a 1970s airiness. The best track, ""The Grain"", is a seven-minute ""love"" song that has guitars mirroring the vocal lines amid a number of space-stretching pastoral breakdowns. It culminates, over and over, with an anthemic multi-person chorus that you'll try to sing along with even if you can't possibly hit the notes. As far as these sorts of moments go, there's also ""The Day the City Died"", an ode to those cities and the places their inhabitants are heading: ""This one's called I'm getting addicted/ This one's called I'm getting evicted/ This one's called another one moving away."" It has a punkier vibe, but filtered through flamboyant 80s metal and, of course, scorching guitar solos. There's also a seven-minute piano-powered ballad, ""Summer Tears"", that had me reaching for my Queensryche albums for the first time since high school. That's important. 17th Street is one of those metal albums that could appeal to fans of Judas Priest, Rush, Thin Lizzy, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater-- lifers not in the know about the current underground, who would stumble upon these 50 minutes of old-school riffing and (actual) singing and fall in love. And, even if you have been keeping track of what's bubbling beneath the mainstream, this is in a class of its own. Cobbett's a talent, one who makes well-considered, carefully crafted music, the kind of stuff that would work well in stadiums if metal of this sort could still fill them.","On their fifth album, San Francisco progressive metal band Hammers of Misfortune ditch their penchant for overblown concepts, get a new vocalist, and focus on 50 minutes of old-school riffing that could appeal to fans of titans like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.

Black and Brown,Black MilkDanny Brown,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d113d197565213a68d/1:1/w_160/f6746ba7.jpeg,2011-10-31 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15987-black-and-brown/,Fat Beats,"To say that Black and Brown, the new collaborative EP from Detroit indie-rap producer Black Milk and shock-rap loose cannon Danny Brown, feels ""half-finished"" would be over-generous. Covering 10 tracks in a scant 22 minutes and bearing a forehead-slap obvious title that probably existed before the project did, Black and Brown is hastily assembled, thoughtlessly sequenced, and conspicuously truncated. There are two songs, back to back, titled ""WTF"" and ""LOL"". Four songs don't exceed the two-minute mark. The overwhelming impression is that the EP exists because an assistant stumbled across an ""in-progress"" folder of mp3s on Black Milk's desktop and leaked the results. And yet, Black Milk is one of indie rap's best and most reliable producers, and Danny Brown, fresh off his brilliant XXX, is riding a white-hot creative streak: which means that Black and Brown is 22 hastily assembled, thoughtlessly sequenced minutes of vivid beats and incredible rapping. Black Milk's beats are boilerplate Black Milk-- post-Dilla instrumentals hitched to hard-knocking drums-- and Brown brings none of the songwriting skill or emotional range that marked XXX, with its tales of stripping hot water heaters from abandoned houses and harrowing accounts of substance abuse. It's a low-stakes affair, aiming at nothing more than head nods, but it induces some deep ones. Brown tamps down the keening high edge in his voice, with the result that he sounds more like Pharaohe Monch than usual. Lyrically, he mostly coasts, but even on autopilot he remains absurdly quotable. ""Morphine metaphors make you do the shoulder lean,"" he spits on ""Loosie"", and the line is a finely tuned mini-marvel of alliteration and craft. Few rappers are as creatively disgusting as Brown-- his missing tooth is ""perfect for lickin clits,"" he informs a potential partner-- but even his shock raps hit their target, more often than not, through some deft bit of linguistic three-card Monte: ""Used to make out with runaways in crack houses/ Now I run away from making out with brick houses,"" he leers on ""Loosie"". Got that? Black Milk's production, meanwhile, continues his career-long argument for the power of immacuately prepared comfort food. His work gathers a lot of strength from old-fashioned flipped samples, but the sound he wrings from them is compellingly tactile, as if the samples were made of some dense-but-yielding material only he knows how to manipulate. His drums have so much character and texture they almost seem to hit twice; ""Zap""'s bone-jarring backbeat lands somewhere indistinct in headphone-space, over a feebly quavering mini-choir of chipmunk-soul voices, and it sounds like you could reach out and run your fingers over it. Milk switches the beat up every one or two minutes, like impatient channel flicking, which both reinforces the beat-tape feeling of Black and Brown and handily keeps it from getting boring. The whole EP is over seemingly as soon as it begins and is the definition of a simple A+B proposition, right down to its name. But it works, and if it means there's a more considered full-length from these two on the way, even better.","To say that this collaborative EP from Detroit indie-rap producer Black Milk and shock-rap loose cannon Danny Brown feels ""half-finished"" would be over-generous.

Long Live the King EP,The Decemberists,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1dc5e6ef959693221c6/1:1/w_160/77ba20be.jpeg,2011-10-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15985-long-live-the-king-ep/,Capitol,"Colin Meloy can read. This fact should surprise no one who has heard the Decemberists, or who has only so much as read one of their press clippings, nearly all of which seem bound, as if by secret contract, to make mention of the music as ""literate."" It's shorthand, of course, for Meloy's tendency towards narrative and metaphor and occasionally inscrutable vocabulary-- a way for writers to telegraph his interest in words without indulging in much of the same. The matter of the L-word has been the primary talking point about the band since Portland's HUSH records released their first EP nearly a decade ago, joined in 2006 by their signing to Capitol, and earlier this year by the somewhat surprising debut of their sixth album at number one on the Billboard charts. Somewhere in there, too, is nearly always talk of Meloy's glasses (well, he wears them) and a mention of the band's fans, usually classified as gawking drama-club nerds (which are indeed there, though for a while now the crowds at their live shows have been comprised less of folks in ""three-button vests"" and more in just plain t-shirts, usually also in pants). To echo an old trope (one that sounds, by coincidence, like the premise of a Decemberists song), the cobbler's children have no shoes: The band that's done more than almost any other in recent years for the art of narrative songcraft can't seem to get a decent story told about its own damn self. But the release of Long Live the King, the follow-up EP to the chart-topping The King Is Dead, offers as good a chance as we may get for a while to pause and take stock of what we might have been missing. The six songs comprise a few nearly-fleshed-out tracks and one demo rescued from the cutting-room floor (plus a previously-released cover of the Grateful Dead's ""Row Jimmy"", which the band sounds like they had a good time recording, making it at least a slight improvement over any of the seven hundred thousand versions of the Dead's original). It's not a cohesive artistic effort so much as a jumble of remainders-- unhemmed, lots of loose strings. Still, like rifling through a quilter's scrap bag, it's easy to see what bits were trimmed off from where, and worth it to see how they now might be put to their own uses. Even moreso than the album they were axed from, these songs are heavy on the literary references; ""Sonnet"", in particular, reconstitutes a Dantean ode to bromance as a jaunty folk romp, punctuated by the welcome, if not a bit startling, appearance of a horn section. But as always, the bookish nods aren't the most interesting things going. Running throughout The King Is Dead and present here too are some striking examples of what may be Meloy's secret strength as a songwriter: not the dispatching of triple-word-score contenders or the re-imagining of ancient archetypes, but the mining of the emotional and physical expanses that separate and unite his characters, who seem to be growing more and more real all the time. Turns out, the fabulist is a humanist, too. Earlier Decemberists songs tended towards thumbnail sketches of individuals-- ghost-babies, destitute barrow boys, slain soldiers. The scope was narrow, a few degrees removed from reality, and focused on death. On Long Live the King, though, when there is killing, we remain fully topside of the grave, and though it may not always be brighter, the emphasis is on the living. More and more now there are songs about ""we's,"" about collective efforts, about sharing the load. (It's not surprising, then, that the stage musical Meloy has been working on for years is about an early-20th-century miners' strike.) The King Is Dead opened with ""Don't Carry It All"" and its cryptic reassurance that ""we are all our hands and holders,"" and while there's nothing so frankly heartening on the EP, the spirit appears in flashes. Everything here is a group effort: the murder of ""E. Watson"", the interring of ""Burying Davy"". These two opening tracks have less of the sunny, rough-handed looseness of the best tracks of The King Is Dead, perhaps explaining their exclusion. Texturally and technically, the shambly home recording of ""I4U & U4ME"" sounds more like a lost track from Meloy's college band Tarkio; it's been since ""Angel, Won't You Call Me?"", on The Decemberists' very first EP, that he, in character or otherwise, has offered himself for a romantic partnership with such indifference: ""We could go together some/ And we could get each other through the night."" It's a jangly, sweet, impatient song, and it's a bummer that it may languish here in demo form for all time; if anything, it would be great to have version where ""fouled up,"" on the pre-chorus, becomes ""fucked up,"" which it seems so badly to want to be. ""Foregone"" is one of Meloy's more directly personal lyrics, and while it might've been right at home on the LP with its shuffling swagger and twanging pedal steel, coupled with ""Rise to Me"" it would have made two references to Meloy's son Henry in one song-cycle. This might be edging a little too close to home for a band whose previous album, after all, exclusively detailed the troubled love life of a shape-shifting foster son of an evil fairy queen. (Like it or not, and many will not, echoes of The Hazards of Love still linger here: ""Burying Davy"" is taut and ominous, the band seeming happy to slip back into the prog-folk murk that this writer occasionally feels pretty lonely in not considering a total career misstep.) Earlier this year, casual mentions of an extended Decemberists hiatus were met with knuckle-gnawing from fans, but especially given this EP, those laments seem premature. The act is a collective of its own, of course, and right now there are other things to tend to: Meloy is writing a young-adult book series; drummer John Moen, bassist Nate Query and guitarist Chris Funk all juggle a number of other bands, as does organist Jenny Conlee, who we're happy to hear has kicked her breast cancer into remission. This isn't the sound of a band closing up shop so much as tidying up the workbench before stepping out for a while. Long Live the King would surely have been an apt title for a swan song, but this isn't one.","The follow-up EP to this year's The King Is Dead is not a cohesive artistic effort so much as a jumble of remainders that, taken on an individual basis, still have a story to tell.

Schlungs,Mungolian Jet Set,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bbb1335d7bf169a31c/1:1/w_160/06057fb5.jpeg,2011-10-28 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15968-schlungs/,Smalltown Supersound,"The first two tracks of Mungolian Jet Set's third album Schlungs (following an album as a modern jazz collective, and 2009's excellent remix compilation We Gave It All Away… Now We Are Taking It Back) offer everything you might want from the expansive prog-disco group. ""2011 - A Space Woodysey"" is a stirring, dramatic opener of flaring strings and mysterious tribal percussion, leading directly into the ten minute frenzy of last year's single ""Moon Jocks N Prog Rocks"", an endlessly mutating singalong disco epic that draws the natural short-circuit between the Mos Eisley Cantina and the Muppets. Taken together, they form the culmination of the group's aesthetic, offering a version of dancefloor maximalism that always threatens to become too large, to careen out of control and explode or implode into the purely ridiculous-- like every great Muppets finale, really. In fact, ""Moon Jocks"" is so perfect an encapsulation of Mungolian Jet Set's seductive extremism that it really ought to have been the last track of its type, after which the silly voices were locked away forever. For Schlungs, however, the Norwegian collective mostly go down the opposite route, spotlighting the puppets while backgrounding the elaborate set pieces behind them. The results are somewhat mixed: Even on the group's most outrageously rococo remixes, the speed of their largesse and the friction of their ridiculousness felt evenly balanced. Here, the music frequently scales down to more human dimensions, at which point the silliness starts to resemble that of real humans: flushed with an over-enthusiastic pleasure you can observe but not share, and at times a bit uncomfortable to be in the same room as. Hypothetically this equation could work, but on the jaunty ""Bella Lanay"" (Doobie Brothers take a trip to the disco) and ""We Are the Shining"" (Giorgio Moroder outtake), it doesn't quite come together, the frequently excellent music sinking beneath the weight of the raucous warbling of a choir of funny uncles. The results aren't awful, but they do feel top-heavy, the unusually restrained arrangements never given a moment to breathe. The charming central synth vamp on ""Bella Lanay"" especially could benefit from an airier vocal, perhaps from a Michael McDonald or Phil Collins pretender who could gift the music's insistent prettiness with a pretense of self-belief. It's telling that ""Smoke N Mirrors"", the album closer and unofficial sequel to ""Moon Jocks"", switches from irritating to marvelous the moment the atonal vocal harmonies are abandoned. For the most part, Schlungs works best when it runs as far from this idea of animatronic pop as possible: the sly, water-treading slomo disco balladry of ""Ties N Downs"", the wonderfully mutational instrumental melodrama of ""Moonstruck"", and the collision of the Black Dog and Jon Hassell on ""Shelton's on a Bender"". The last of these might be somewhat ungainly in its mixture of stabbing percussion, eerie trumpet, sampled choral vocals, and growling bass, but it's perhaps the album's most interesting moment, fully inhabiting the dark fourth-world funk that forms the yang to disco's yin in the group's best work. Darkness-- or, more precisely, a certain ominous alienness-- is what gives Mungolian Jet Set's preposterousness its charisma, suggesting an extraterrestrial consciousness operating beyond questions of humor or seriousness. Human dimensions don't really work for this group, not because the epic is what they ""do,"" but because their music sounds best when it becomes lost in its own logic, creating and then exploring a world of its own rather than just a quirky version of ours-- more 2001: A Space Odyssey, less ""Mork & Mindy"". In its pinnacles and pitfalls, Schlungs confirms that, even if the results can be cute, communicating with humans is usually the least impressive talent any alien has.","The first two tracks from the playful, conceptual Norwegian collective's third album offer everything you might want from the expansive prog-disco group.

Hazed Dream,Psychic Ills,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e1ea9e61561daa6838/1:1/w_160/e16cff2c.jpeg,2011-10-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15984-psychic-ills/,Sacred Bones,"If the end-all-be-all point of psychedelic music is transcendence, Psychic Ills have taken a whack at just about every path that shows any promise of getting there. The Brooklyn trio has done space-rock freak-outs, heavy minimalist drones, and abstract synthesizer mulch, all of which has been unspooled across two LPs, a handful of small-press singles, a compilation album, and, probably, a box full of all-night free-form practice tapes. The Ills' third LP, Hazed Dream, finds them taking another approach, sidelining the guitar solos in favor of stripped-down and straightforward songwriting. In his lightly blazed tenor, Tres Warren-- the band's guitarist, singer, and principle songwriter-- coolly considers the subjects that have long fascinated and vexed his space-rock forebears: sunshine, roads, walking down roads, walking with Jesus, and things that are and aren't all right. The pace is whispery and mellow, the fuzz pedal presumably out of batteries. It's pure moods music for cowboy stoners. There's nothing here that's going to explode any eyeballs or melt the paint off the wall, but it's a step in the right direction for Psychic Ills, whose output has been fairly inconsistent since their 2006 debut, Dins. During the mid 2000s, it sometimes felt like Psychic Ills were a band in the right place at the right time with the wrong music. Their contemporaries and labelmates, like Gang Gang Dance and Black Dice, ditched guitars for samplers and new-age synthesizer tones, pursuing spacey music's more under-explored permutations and, eventually, finding modest popularity. For all their stylistic restlessness, Psychic Ills were traditionalists, sticking to established, well-worn 1960s psych and krautrock sounds. Hazed Dream is a record that fits more precisely into its time and place. With their mumbled verses and slacker spirituality, Warren's compositions aren't terribly distant from Kurt Vile's effect pedal-enhanced folk-rock, albeit lacking in some of the Philly-based rocker's gift for conjuring pastoral sprawl. In the subdued soloing, you can hear echoes of San Francisco retro noodlers Wooden Shjips. Psychic Ills hung on to their schtick long enough that they seem to have phased back into tune with their peers. But transcendence via free-form freak-out is further away than ever. Hazed Dream has some heady moments-- the languid guitar intro to ""Incense Head"" and the head-nodding chords of ""Mexican Wedding""-- but the songs are just too mellow, understated, and lyrically anonymous to move the needle much.","The Brooklyn psych trio's third LP finds them sidelining the space-rock freak outs in favor of stripped down and straightforward songwriting, creating pure moods music for cowboy stoners.

Preserved,Young Bleed,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1dac0084474cd0c1ea1/1:1/w_160/b9a5d768.jpeg,2011-10-28 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15981-preserved/,Strange Lane,"The No Limit record label has long been treated with a patronizing condescension from critics, although in much of the country, the label's stars were the biggest and most influential of their era. Baton Rouge's Young Bleed was one of Master P's many late-1990s marketing successes. 1998's My Balls and My Word sold half a million copies-- not Mystikal-levels, but certainly a respectable number for a 20-year-old rapper advertised solely in No Limit liner notes and the pages of Murder Dog magazine. Since that time, Young Bleed has continued to release material, with his trademark laconic delivery effortlessly masking suave precision. Now his alliance with Tech N9ne's Strange Music label has found the rapper releasing his best collection of songs since 1999's Priority Records release My Own. Preserved could easily describe Young Bleed's loyalty to the reliable sound of his earliest work. Because the sound is such an un-mined era in rap history, it is a comforting approach to anyone who fondly remembers the country-fried g-rap of ""How You Do That"". Leadoff track ""Put Your Stamp on It"", which was actually released in YouTube-only format back in 2006, is an easy standout, with its nonchalant swagger. Although ""Make Em Say Ugh"" might give dilettantes the notion that No Limit was all aggressive energy, raw and explosive, Young Bleed was always at his strongest with the kind of strutting restraint on display here. The variety of production within that framework makes Preserved an especially interesting listen. Lead single ""Holla at Uh Dog"" is built upon bongos and an exotic flute loop. The way it injects the music video's swamp setting with a particular magic is representative of Bleed's approach as whole: giving the everyday or the cliché a mythical significance. ""It's Nut'n""-- Bleed often writes his track titles out phonetically-- is one of the record's more adventurous beats. Along with stammering horns, the production is all texture, layered money-counting machines and clattering drums giving it the feel of a factory at full-tilt; it is like a ghost of the record's implied setting, the post-industrial landscape of neighborhoods and cities of the economically abandoned. ""Call the Police"", meanwhile, places the album in a specific geography, with its accordion-accompanied zydeco groove, while ""City Uh God"" has an extremely effective live-music feel with its strummed guitars. Only ""Wall Uh Fame"", which has a Lupe Fiasco-esque ""inspirational"" melody, breaks the record's general mood, aiming for emotional transcendence a bit too blatantly. Of course, it's Young Bleed himself who primarily carries the record by focusing the listener's attention to his lyrics. Fans of Curren$y might find something to like here; Bleed's flow has always utilized a similarly slick, imperturbable delivery to buttress more intricately musical rhythms and rhyme schemes. His persona, however, differs considerably from Curren$y's newer incarnation as a jet-setting stoner; Bleed emphasizes the individualism, agency, and nobility of the street soldier, weaving a universal story of hustle and struggle through implied, writer-ly details and a sixth sense for style. Preserved could as easily refer to his stylistic approach as the quality of his output, which remains high 13 years into the game.","On his fifth release, Preserved, the Southern hip-hop mainstay puts together his best album since his 1999 sophomore collection My Own.

Sessions 1981–83,Void,by: Hank Shteamer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bdc0084474cd0c1e6e/1:1/w_160/30e5d6f6.jpeg,2011-10-28 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15969-sessions-198183/,Dischord,"Void are one of those bands whose reputation thrives on scarcity. Up till now, this early-1980s D.C.-area hardcore quartet's entire discography (aside from a few compilation tracks) could be heard in under 16 minutes-- and not even on a proper full-length but a split LP, shared with the equally obscure Faith. There's something about that split, though. Thanks to devoted bloggers and high-profile superfans like Damian Abraham and Matt Korvette (of Fucked Up and Pissed Jeans, respectively), hardcore has become something of a scholarly discipline in recent years, and few records are more revered in that DIY academia than 1982's so-called Faith/Void. Drummer Aesop Dekker (Agalloch, ex-Ludicra) quipped, ""Faith v. Void (1982), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that overturned mediocrity in hardcore splits."" Sam McPheeters (Born Against, Men's Recovery Project, and more) dubbed it one of ""the best records of the 20th century."" And none other than Bill ""Smog"" Callahan named a song after the damn thing (""Faith/Void,"" from 2009's Sometimes I Wish I Were an Eagle). ""It's one of my favorite records,"" he told Impose, ""especially the Void side."" There's no denying the bottled-lightning brilliance of said side-- a sputtering, cacophonous masterpiece, the unhinged id to the comparatively orderly ego of fellow Washingtonians Minor Threat-- but when considering its sterling reputation, you have to factor in its singularity. Underground obsessives love not just the music, but also the idea that Void made one perfect half of one record and that's pretty much it. (That might be why you don't hear too much about Potion for Bad Dreams, the never-released but widely fileshared LP that Void cut for Touch and Go after the Faith split.) So in issuing Sessions 1981-83, a compilation of demos and rarities spanning Void's brief career (except for two outtakes from the split itself and two 1983 live tracks, everything here predates Faith/Void), is Dischord downgrading the band's priceless cachet? In one sense, maybe so, since these sides humanize Void. Listening to the initial 30 of the comp's 34 tracks, sourced from the quartet's first two studio visits in November and December of 1981, you quickly realize that Void's members weren't unsocialized head cases who managed to focus long enough only to record 12 exquisitely fucked-up songs. On the contrary, vocalist John Weiffenbach, guitarist Bubba Dupree, bassist Chris Stover, and drummer Sean Finnegan (sadly deceased as of 2008), were angry, sometimes goofy suburban kids from Columbia, Md., playing hard, writing prolifically, and steadily developing the confidence to embrace pure, howling chaos-- not so different, in other words, from all the other high-school-aged architects of hardcore across the U.S. The majority of Sessions 1981-83 doesn't transcend its genre the way Void's contribution to Faith/Void does, but it does provide enlightening context for that deservedly obsessed-over release. Just as importantly, this stuff is good, snotty fun. Void's bread and butter was the turbo-speed rant, and the November '81 recordings here feature many prime examples, like the self-explanatory ""Suburbs Suck"", ""Annoyed"", and ""Don't Wanna Be Like You"", which last 38, 28, and 49 seconds, respectively. These songs may represent rock's lowest common denominator-- a pair of buzzsaw riffs, a coming-off-the-rails oompah beat, and a litany of adolescent gripes-- but Void's disaffection is the kind you can't fake, the definition of troubled teenhood. Unlike Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye, whose cogent statements clued you in to a sharp political mind, Weiffenbach's raw-nerve howl often gave voice to straight-up nihilism; witness ""War Hero"" (which would later appear on Faith/Void), with its ""I want to die… in a war!"" refrain. But just when you think you have Void pegged as one-note rageaholics, they surprise you with a bit of poignant social commentary (""Black, Jewish, and Poor"", where Weiffenbach's slurred, sneering voice sounds like the blueprint for Wavves' Nathan Williams) or charming self-satire (""Please Give Us a Chance"", which disclaims, ""Just because Chris sucks shit on bass/ Just because Sean can't keep up a beat/ Just because Bubba doesn't know any chords/ Just because I don't know my words…""). Void shouldn't have been so hard on themselves: As primitive as this material is, much of it is unshakably catchy, especially ""Organized Sports"" and ""My Rules"" (both re-recorded for the split), which feature anthemic choruses driven by Dupree's metallic midtempo crunch. Even as the 1981-model Void were learning how to write effectively in the still-nascent hardcore mode, they were also beginning to deconstruct the form. Right from the beginning, the band wantonly tested the limits of what a song could be. Consider ""Draft Me Please"", which moves from a textbook speed-punk verse into a weird pile-up of a chorus; here, Dupree peels off a snarling phrase, and Finnegan answers with a series of impressionistic taps, abandoning the beat in the process. For a few frantic seconds, the whole band jettisons the idea of tempo, to intoxicating effect. These chaotic episodes would become more and more pronounced, until they were as much a part of Void's compositional style as the more intelligible material. The most valuable aspect of Sessions 1981-83 is how it illustrates this steady march toward violent abstraction, especially in Dupree's playing. As wild as his bandmates were, the half-black, half-Filipino guitarist was a maniac of a different order, the X-factor that gave Void a whiff of dangerous insanity. (Dave Grohl, an avowed Void fan, was among those taking note; he tapped Dupree for a frenetic cameo on his 2004 Probot record.) The three versions of ""Dehumanized"" here-- one apiece from November and December of '81, and a June 1982 outtake from the session that yielded Void's contributions to Faith/Void-- tell the story plainly. Listening to them in succession, you hear Dupree's ""Eureka!"" awakening to the aesthetic potential of noise. On the first attempt, he plays the dutiful riff machine, clearly stating the song's start-stop verse motif and chugging, downstroked chorus. During the much faster December take, he fills the gaps in the first verse with bursts of feedback; by verse two, he's in full-on assault mode, scraping out tortured growls and squeals that make Black Flag's Greg Ginn, hardcore's most notorious six-string sicko, sound cautious by comparison. The final ""Dehumanized"" is a glorious mess, with Dupree alternating between proto-thrash attack and what sounds like a malfunctioning power saw. Weiffenbach responds with a borderline black-metal snarl, and we're finally hearing the band at its peak derangement. Sessions 1981-83 offers one final masochistic delight: a 1983 live version of Faith/Void's concluding track, ""Explode"", which feels like the missing link between hardcore and ruthless modern-day noise. ""Our last song,"" Weiffenbach blankly announces, and Stover launches into a manic cyclical bass riff. Dupree answers with a gradually accelerating throb; Weiffenbach lets out a tortured yowl; and suddenly the full band whooshes in. The aural dogpile that follows out-extremes even the hallowed split LP. It bears little resemblance to punk rock, or any sort of song-based soundmaking; instead, it's a mini exorcism that places Void in the illustrious lineage of amplified din, stretching from Jimi Hendrix up through Keiji Haino and Prurient. Appropriately, it's Dupree we hear last, conjuring spiky, alien sound shapes. If the rest of Sessions 1981-83 serves as a entertaining and educational scrapbook, this track reminds you why, three decades on, Void are still spoken of in hushed tones. Much like John Coltrane toward the end of his life, this band, near the conclusion of its own too-short existence, pierced the veil separating its musical style from an ultimate, unbound-by-genre catharsis. Not bad for a couple of pissed-off suburban kids.","Until now, Void's discography boiled down to 16 minutes on a revered 1982 split LP. This 34-track compilation of demos and rarities humanizes the early-80s genre-transcending D.C. hardcore quartet.

Ah yes, and there's She & Him, her Instagram-folk outfit with the quietly excellent M. Ward, proud parents of two cheerily frivolous full-length records many people took remarkably seriously, and why not. And now, a Christmas album. Various deluxe editions come packaged with a hat and/or mittens. If any or all of this enrages you (including her perfectly competent, bizarrely derided delivery of the National Anthem at a World Series game the other day), you oughta find other stuff to get enraged about. (Seriously, no worse than B- for vocal, and, okay, D+ for the dress.) Even if you don't buy into her It Girl/sex-symbol campaign, let us admit that Zooey's dainty, bright, appealingly low-swooping voice is Good for an Actress, and that's only, like, 15% pejorative. But A Very She & Him Christmas actually isn't hateable enough. Whether you come to praise or bury it, you're looking for something ultra-campy, overloaded with rampant corniness and gratuitous special guests, the holiday equivalent of Jenny Lewis' cover of ""Handle With Care"". Nah though. No Ben Gibbard, no Will Ferrell, no Mark Wahlberg, nobody. Lots of guitar-and-vocal skeletal sparseness, reaching for transcendent Charlie Brown melancholia but arriving instead at something merely dour. She sings, ""They know that Santa's on his way,"" as though ""Santa"" were actually a plague of locusts. She should've recorded this while drunk. Oh, now, though, these songs are fine, fine. ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" has a nearly erotic rockabilly sashay, and M. Ward solos with economical dexterity throughout, and improves the record exponentially when his grumbly vocals first kick in on the shuffling ""Christmas Wish""; their voices are lovely when intertwined, and at least offer a whiff of transcendent melancholia. Your crucial jam here is ordinarily immensely problematic yuletide sexual-predator anthem ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", America's first taste of her vocal talents via Elf, the gender roles now swapped so Zooey bars the door and M. wonders what's in this drink; she blows through her lines in a zippy Eleanor Friedberger jumble, finally loosening up. Most of the rest is just retightened Don't Fuck It Up competence, alas-- nothing you could call sacrilege, especially given that any Christmas-themed song that does not explicitly praise the birth of Jesus is technically sacrilege. Her ""Blue Christmas"" is alright but can't touch Porky Pig's; her ""Little Saint Nick"" is alright but can't touch John Denver and the Muppets'. They add an extra beat to ""Sleigh Bells"" so as to feel all musical. They attempt to redeem the irredeemable ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and nearly succeed; they attempt to add gratuitous gravitas to a solo-Zooey ""Silver Bells"" and fail. (Step away from the ukulele, first of all, and it's hard to sell the line, ""And above all this bustle you hear,"" when there ain't no bustle.) ""The Christmas Song"" closes us out similarly too prim and grim, but it'll nonetheless ably soundtrack quite a few Xmas-morning marriage proposals amongst happy couples who also knitted each other sweaters to complement their reindeer-besieged wool pajama pants. (Cotton, make that cotton.) It'd be nice to make even more cheap children's librarian jokes, but they played this one too safe. For a record whose immediate cultural precedent is Pomplamoose's Hyundai ads, this should have been way more polarizing. Savage the Kinks' ""Father Christmas"", excavate Paul McCartney's mega-twee ""Wonderful Christmastime"", give Vince Guaraldi's grave a few spins, something. No, for schadenfreude proceed directly to Scott Weiland's A Methadone Christmas or whatever it's called; A Very She & Him stands guilty not of being oppressively adorkable, but of being not nearly adorkable enough.","After two albums of cheerily frivolous indie pop, Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward return with an album of Christmas tunes.

Waterworx EP,Jam City,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b513d197565213a663/1:1/w_160/7ec04860.jpeg,2011-10-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15955-waterworx/,Night Slugs,"When Night Slugs Allstars Vol. 1 dropped late last year, Jam City was a still-new artist for the still-new London label. His work to date has flitted between heavy-lidded rave-hop (it's easy enough to infer what the title of his Magic Drops 12"" refers to) and manic electronic funk (""Arpjam"", from the Allstars comp). I preferred the latter; crystalline techno pinging always seems a more difficult bar to hurdle than stoned beat-smithing. On his latest, five-track EP, Waterworx, Jam City paints in the bright, bold strokes that Night Slugs has made its name on while adopting a clarity and purposefulness he hasn't shown before. Waterworx reminds me of the work of second-wave Detroit techno producers like Carl Craig and Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir. Craig and Shakir (and their peers) were in a unique spot: The techno sound had been developed, and they weren't necessarily beholden to it. They incorporated house and rave into their compositions. The result was often a level-headed brand of dance-funk that felt clean and precise. Jam City has no need for that scene's fantastical futurism-- Waterworx sounds very, very contemporary-- but it does borrow its linear beats and organized busyness. Jam City pushes the melodic elements of his tracks to the fore, and the tracks are interesting in part because these elements are unlikely focal points. ""Aqua Box"" takes the recent proliferation of rave sirens and turns it on its head, offering a distended, zombie-fied bleat. An industrial hammer of a synth patch powers ""Countess""; the peeling scythe that interrupts it reminds me of the pitched strings in Britney Spears' ""Toxic"". ""Waterfalls"" is softened by electric pianos and Villalobos-like chants. The only track that doesn't maintain this pattern is the widescreen ""Island"", which shoots chords toward the horizon then aims drum rolls at them. The bass on Waterworx-- thumping mallet hits, ever so slightly fuzzy-- confirm a producer who's spent his formative years in the bass scene but never became obsessed with it. Though a good fit on the Night Slugs roster, Waterworx positions Jam City among artists like San Francisco's Salva and Nottingham's Lone (he lacks Lone's knack for winding melodies) who have dropped bass music like an Alka-Seltzer into techno and rave. (There's lots of fizzing, and it may take a few years before they learn how to make it taste good.) Waterworx is an obvious step forward, the first clear sign of direction from an exciting talent.","The young London producer Jack Latham's latest EP paints in the bright, bold strokes of his hometown label Night Slugs.

Divine Providence,Deer Tick,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cbea9e61561daa6812/1:1/w_160/3b588c27.jpeg,2011-10-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15965-divine-providence/,Partisan,"Along with codependents like Dawes and more recently Blitzen Trapper, Deer Tick have taken advantage of rock's ebb from masculine aggressiveness, guitars, and live debauchery and assumed the mantle of a certain rabble-rousing, hard-living, road-dog ideal to much acclaim. But on their previous LPs, you could chalk up their ""real deal"" shtick to youth and inexperience, and it was hard to truly hate-- how to explain the heel turn they take here? Within the first 10 minutes, John J. McCauley III has laid out in no uncertain terms that he's going to get super blotto tonight, called you a fucking douchebag, belched loudly, and then capped it off by matter-of-factly stating, ""let's all get drunk."" You know, we all have our laugh at hipster bars, but spend some time in Divine Providence's wake of spilled beers, slurred insults, and macho posturing, and recognize that terrible mustaches and ""Bring Your Own Cassette"" nights are the least of our problems. Maybe it's got something to do with the boys being back in town: They recorded in their home city, where the drink will flow and the blood will spill and if McCauley wants to fight, you better let him. This isn't a problem in and of itself, since McCauley has an endearingly ragged, if not always euphonious voice that's built for this sort of outlaw pose. Likewise, as a band Deer Tick have enough expertise to handle any style of intoxicated rock with ample hooks-- alt-country, early Replacements punk, Brit Invasion garage-- but play it sloppy enough to make it clear that being confined to a studio is a necessary evil before they come to your town and help you party down. Unless they have a warrant in it, and according to barnstorming opener ""The Bump"", they almost certainly do. And it's certainly admirable in theory that McCauley chooses to be the increasingly rare lyricist relying on storytelling-- for all of the basic rhymes and stunted poetry, he intends to be heard and taken at face value. Problem is, these songs thus live and die by the depth of McCauley's characters, and while they fuck up repeatedly and alienate everyone including the listener, they're not so much lovable losers as horribly unsympathetic people who just aren't compelling at all-- the perfect bar band for Paddy's Pub, only without the jokes. ""Give me a spark!/ And I'm an atom bomb!/ Give me some pills/ And I can't stand up!"" McCauley yells during ""The Bump"" while the band barely chips in with off-key harmonies and an interminable whistling solo as reminders that these dudes don't give a shit, bro. They don't take no shit either-- not from no two-bit job (""Chevy Express""), or woman (take your pick), or new boyfriend (""Make Believe""), or the cops (again, take your pick). Problem is, it's hard for you to give a shit either with Deer Tick's insistence on merely borrowing swagger instead of owning it. This is particularly true of the otherwise anthemic ""Main Street"", which conjures the mythos of the Rolling Stones by namedropping a bunch of their albums you could be listening to instead. Then again, I'll take their unfocused flexing of beer muscles over weepy barstool poetry-- ""Electric"" nixes the drums and guitars so McCauley can get a little time to himself to philosophize about our social contract (""I need electric to get me high/ But I don't need your friendly smiles/ I'm just the brakes and you're the miles""...huh?). But even with the portentous, droning keyboards, the lack of resonance is borderline laughable, and besides, by the next song, he's regained enough of a third wind to act like a leg-humping frat dude turning on some last-call sleaze over ""Brown Eyed Girl"" (""Miss K.""). To top it off, there's the C&W weeper sung by drummer Dennis Ryan working shopworn prayers about fighting off the devil, a concerned wife, and pedophilic urges with lines like, ""I take cover behind my white facepaint/ While I battle my bitter father's ghost."" Then you realize why this particular song is called ""Clownin' Around"", and it's actually more soul-crushing than Sufjan Stevens' ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."", albeit for none of the same reasons. For real, I'd love to think Deer Tick are fighting the good fight or at least serve a necessary purpose as rock music skews increasingly meta. Even if it's essentially a Bloodhound Gang song, or ""TV Party"" for the kind of people who thought Damaged was an endorsement for alcoholism, I gotta admit I got a laugh out of the dumbshit chants of ""Let's All Go to the Bar""-- and if I ever find myself at a raging kegger in the near future, I won't hesitate to swap out ""Red Solo Cup"" for it. But the problem is, almost none of the decadence on Divine Providence sounds like any fun at all, nor is it self-aware enough to serve as some sort of cautionary tale. Don't blame it on the Henny-- to name a few bands working in a similarly boozy milieu, Titus Andronicus (the former band of guitarist Ian O'Neil) offer bracing unity, Hold Steady great stories, and Drive-By Truckers exponentially more empathy for the human condition. Deer Tick try to score points simply by sounding like they could drink all those bands under the table, and the self-absorbed and even downright hateful Divine Providence ends up drinking at you, not with you.","On the Providence roots rockers' previous LPs, you could chalk up their rabble-rousing, hard-living, road-dog ideal to youth and inexperience, and it was hard to truly hate. It's a different story with Divine Providence.

Dreamchasers,Meek Mill,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d59d034d5c69bf4aa2/1:1/w_160/da05ae4d.jpeg,2011-10-27 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15977-dreamchasers/,,"Here's the biggest surprise in rap this year: Its preeminent tastemaker is Rick Ross. Imagine that being true in 2009, when, after being outed as an ex-corrections officer, Ross got roped into a childish feud with 50 Cent, who rediscovered his ability to ruffle the feathers of his overly serious peers, while blogs and commenters gleefully cackled along. That Ross emerged from the embarrassing fracas to become one of the few larger-than-life stars in the game was shocking enough, but now his stamp of approval alone is enough to make, or salvage, careers. Wale, who was left for dead by the major label system following his disastrous first album, was scooped up by Ross after a rather pedestrian appearance on Waka Flocka Flame's smash hit ""No Hands"" and is now poised to sell hundreds of thousands of copies of his upcoming album. But Ross' most intriguing protégé is the young (though by no means rookie) Philadelphia street rapper Meek Mill, a fact not lost on Ross, who saw fit to include himself on both of Meek's radio singles from this year. Being from Philly, it's easy to see the lineage of ex-Roc-A-Fella underlings State Property in Meek's excitable, eager shout. But we're a long way from 2002, and there's a distinctly Southern bent to his rapping that has helped him rise to prominence during the reign of Lex Luger. Meek still carries an air of detached cool that is no doubt filtered down from Jay-Z, but the rapper that he often resembles is the currently imprisoned Lil' Boosie. Though his music isn't as emotionally raw as Boosie's, both rappers engage the listener on a purely visceral level, primarily through deliveries that seem on the verge of careening off the rails. The ability to connect in this manner is something that can't be taught, or even really developed. An untold number of rappers have tried to get over on energy and the sheer force of their charisma alone, but certain guys-- DMX, Waka, Boosie-- have an innate ability to connect with their audiences in a way that can leave non-believers, especially ones who privilege lyricism, baffled. Sometimes pro scouts will watch an athlete and say that the player has ""it""-- well, Meek Mill, at least in this regard, has ""it."" Dreamchasers -- coming after the relative success of singles ""Tupac Back"" and ""Ima Boss"", and with DJ Drama on foghorn duties-- is easily the biggest solo release of Meek's career, and it ends up serving a dual purpose. On the one hand, it easily showcases how deep his talent runs and how versatile an artist he can be. On the other, it functions as a blueprint for exactly what kind of rap music he should and should not be focused on making as his career moves forward. Let's start with the disappointing stuff. The tape is littered with beats either produced by Lex Luger or by people copying Lex Luger, and while that sound is now minted and unavoidable, Meek Mill isn't a rapper that needs to be working off the template. ""Ima Boss"", which is also included on the tape, is evidence enough that Meek can bark his way onto the radio without having to fall back on Luger's lurching productions. Meek doesn't sound bad on those songs, per say, but the highlights of the tape prove just how unnecessary the generics are. For someone who doesn't try and dazzle with his lyrics, he possesses an exceptional eye for telling stories on both a macro and micro level. ""Middle of Da Summer"", for instance, finds Meek using the season as a frame for sketching a portrait of how his city revolved around him as he grew into a life of crime. ""Tony Story"" is not only one of the most vivid story raps in recent memory, but its plot and development are so engrossing on a cinematic level that it should give David Simon pause. And then there's the title track, with a beat straight out of the Clams Casino school of ""soulful"" and featuring a particularly devastating guest shot from Beanie Sigel, which transcends the trappings of rote inspirational ploys via Meek's sober and realistic rendering of the life of a struggling rapper. Meek is being groomed for rap stardom, and the genre would be better off if he were able to get there. But while his proximity to Rick Ross has accelerated his career and will continue to open doors for his art, it's important for him to remember that he's not Ross and doesn't need to be. There are plenty of mid-tier rappers willing to merely ride out Lex Luger's wave, but Meek has enough dimensions to be in it for the long haul.","Rick Ross' most intriguing protégé is young Philadelphia street rapper Meek Mill.

We Stay Together,Andy Stott,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bf5e6ef959693221a3/1:1/w_160/01ec2e05.jpeg,2011-10-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/,Modern Love,"Six months after his Passed Me By EP advanced like a scorched-earth campaign over the ruins of dance music, Andy Stott is back with another six tracks of charred techno. You can bet that in the fast-zombies-versus-slow-zombies debate, Stott sides with the groaners and stumblers: As was his previous record, We Stay Together is a Frankenstein's monster pieced together from scraps of club tracks pitched down to an agonizing crawl. Funny things happen at this speed: The beats lurch violently, kicking up clouds of ash with every impact; every syncopation becomes a hesitant shudder. Sampled vocals, looming in the background, turn to a jellied groan. The record begins rather demurely with ""Submission"", five minutes of choral samples and ambient flutter that suggests the sound of a thousand pigeons ruffling their feathers in a catacomb. ""Posers"", which follows, sets up the idea that will maintain across the rest of the record, with a slowed-down railroad chug, tri-tone strings, and dissonant washes of synthesizer; distant horns sound the mournful call of a failed hunt. Despite the leaden drowsiness, it still moves: There's an infectious sense of groove in its shuffling percussion and echoing finger snaps. After ""Posers"", the record's fastest track-- around the same tempo as many of the slow-motion house and disco records being produced by artists like John Talabot, Kassem Mosse, and Blondes; it only feels slower, thanks to its blasted, narcotic production-- things get really torpid. Not just sluggish, but also nasty and mean, degraded and depraved, with more of that death-gurgle bass that led me to compare Stott's last record to Sunn O))). If anything, We Stay Together sounds even more like it could have been released by Southern Lord. On vinyl, We Stay Together serves a two-for-one purpose: It's meant to be played at 33, but if you speed it up to 45, most of the record's tracks actually become punishing, industrial-strength techno, the kind of sledgehammers associated with Berlin's famously intense Berghain club. Even played like this, though, they don't sound like ""normal"" techno: they're warped, muted, blown out-- they sound wrong. ""Bad Wires"" becomes like Surgeon being run through a cubic meter of boiled wool; the clanging ""Cracked"" comes to sound like several dub techno tracks being played in parallel, with rhythms so disorienting you may wonder if Stott simply sampled a particularly hairy passage from an old DJ mix and slowed it down by 30%. There's another reason to get this record on vinyl: It sounds way, way better. That might seem odd, given that so much of Stott's sound has to do with using compression, distortion, and other effects to make his music not just strange but even ugly. But, on wax, his swollen low end growls in a way that's almost sensual. (If you must buy digital, pay the extra bucks for the FLAC version; the difference between the high-bitrate version and a compressed MP3 is very real.) Despite the surface similarities between We Stay Together and Passed Me By, it doesn't feel like Stott is repeating himself. Both records may seem like hellish vultures picking over the carcass of dance music, but every track on the new record yields fresh morsels. Fans of Stott's labelmates Demdike Stare, and all the other goth-n-screw artists out there at the moment, will be happy to gnaw on these bones.","Six months after his Passed Me By EP advanced like a scorched-earth campaign over the ruins of dance music, Manchester-based DJ and producer Andy Stott is back with another six tracks of charred, crawling techno.

Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You: The Fonotone Years (1958¬–1965),John Fahey,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c8ea9e61561daa680c/1:1/w_160/9e182134.jpeg,2011-10-27 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15959-your-past-comes-back-to-haunt-you-the-fonotone-years-19581965/,Dust-to-DigitalRevenant,"The liner notes for Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You-- the complete recordings guitarist John Fahey made for the tiny but crucial Fonotone label between 1958 and 1965-- comprise an 88-page book, bound in beautifully toned, dense cardboard. These 88 pages brim with an obsessive sort of information about Fahey: his slapdash drawings of important people and places in his life, the first known photograph of him with a Gibson F-hole guitar, the receipt for his Holzapfel 12-string, his Boy Scouts photo, and even a personal letter to Fonotone owner Joe Bussard where he begs for recordings of a few old blues heroes. There's a revealing and hitherto unpublished interview, remembrances from past collaborators, and Italian researcher Claudio Guerrieri's guide to the various hand-written labels Bussard affixed to the center of each record he hand-cut on order. The centerpiece of the book is Malcolm Kirton's exhaustive 40-page examination of every track on the 115-piece, 5xCD, six-hour set, including Fahey's thoughts on the tunes, his tunings, his techniques, and how a scrawny, awkward white kid from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. came to learn obscure songs from even more obscure black bluesmen long before CD reissues and online archives were even an idea. It should be noted that Kirton also helped produce The Roots of John Fahey, a free online archive of many of the songs in question. Like this set, it is also essential. As the guitarist, enthusiast, and project co-producer Glenn Jones quips in his own introduction, ""Let's face it, who is this set for if not Fahey's most hardcore fans?"" Actually, Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You is not just for Fahey zealots. It's for anyone interested in the story of American music, from its Appalachian string bands and mean-moaning Delta blues singers to the hymns sung from its church pews and the country-rock anthems soon enough crafted by its hippies. But Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You is not only the story of the musician John Fahey, it's also the story of the songs that have become crucial to his country, a place that Fahey explored from one end (he was raised in Maryland) to the other (he lived in Hawaii at one point and died in Oregon). Somewhat comparable to the sprawling ethnomusicological work of Alan Lomax, Harry Smith, Art Rosenbaum, Nick Perls, and others like them, Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You is a rich overview of America's musical bedrock-- only here, it's told through the hard-won, fast-paced development of a guitarist who, in turn, changed the way future players could consider their instrument. A must-have collection of lore, music, and history, it's a unified, brilliant, and often very challenging archive. During four decades between the time this set was recorded and Fahey's death in 2001, the guitarist would cover expansive musical ground, from transfixing, blues-based tone poems that stretched the boundaries of his instrument to, years later, luminous drones that synced with the interests of a new generation of his advocates. As Robbie Basho said in an oft-repeated explanation, ""Fahey and myself are playing frustrated little symphonies on guitar."" Over time, he was a philosophy major, an author, a record label owner, a curator, and a strange storyteller. However, here on these either unreleased or very hard-to-find tracks, he's a young American adult rifling through his friends' record collections and taking road trips to rural lands to find the music and musicians that he really loves-- raging country blues and blissful acoustic hymns, written and recorded by the likes of Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Elizabeth Cotten, Bukka White, Will Moore, Mississippi John Hurt, and a canon of others, all while building his own style. Emotionally, technically, and stylistically, Fahey makes for a suitably uneven tour guide through these dusty back pages, like a metabolic personification of Greil Marcus' old, weird America. On one version of ""Poor Boy Blues"", recorded in 1959, he plays with a great, repetitive sadness, the 20-year-old doing his best to sing like a Mississippi septuagenarian, as if inborn with an inescapable melancholy. About a year earlier, he'd folded the same tune into ""Libba's Rag"", an apparent homage to mentor Elizabeth Cotten. It sounds young and vaguely hopeful, always on the verge of lifting off. Nearly two years later, he wove a glimpse of another version of the tune-- learned from his master of sorts, Charley Patton-- into ""Dasein River Blues"", the kind of slow, wobbly, serpentine country-blues stagger that would eventually give some of Fahey's best-known music its trademark, trance-like essence. Fahey sometimes navigates these tunes with crystalline clarity, as with his stately reverence for the fifth-century ""St. Patrick's Hymn"" or his haunted slide guitar dirge behind ""In the Pines"", a duet with mountain singer Fran Vandiver. Elsewhere, he pugnaciously repurposes the material, as when he snaps the strings hard against the slide of a 1960 take on ""John Henry"" or slurs the words of ""Green Blues"". He hammers out the chords with a great aggression, as though they'd said something about his mother. Admittedly, some of the material here stands as a curiosity at best. Fahey's six collaborations with flautist Nancy McLean function more as a testament to his inquisitiveness as a player and listener than something you'll want to hear repeatedly; the same goes for his raucous, wasted take on ""I Shall Not Be Moved"". Similarly, some of the short guitar solos included here-- two versions of the gorgeous cowboy song ""Goodbye Old Paint"" or his slide through ""House Carpenter""-- aren't testaments to his otherwise-apparent abilities as an arranger. They simply shape our understanding of his lexicon. By set's end, though, Fahey's working through knotty versions of the romantic ""How Long"" and ""You Take the E Train"" (better known as ""The Last Steam Engine Train""). These songs and several of their contemporaries illustrate Fahey's very original synthesis of folk, blues, classical, and even old American standards. He was a zealous collector and an ingenious interpreter, two qualities that Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You takes great care to link. Fahey's legacy and reputation among modern guitarists is overwhelming and inescapable. Just as pop-rock bands with stacked harmonies and two guitars can't escape Beatles comparisons, an upstart learning to flatpick must initially step up to or around Fahey's prominence. Though Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You lives up to its name by finally presenting a lot of material Fahey admitted he would rather forget, it ultimately confirms his stature as one of music's pioneering polymaths. The tunes here are, at turns, funny or solemn, sober or delirious, studied or shambolic, but, with it all, Fahey was able to ingest and utilize a broad range of feelings and ideas into takes that remain totally singular and identifiable. During a session at home with Bussard in the spring of 1960, Fahey cut seven songs, including a particularly charged version of ""Sitting on Top of the World"" and a delicate, subtle ragtime mutation he called ""Hill High Blues"". The last song Fahey ostensibly cut that day was ""Paint Brush Blues"", improvised on a lark after he picked up a paintbrush Bussard used to keep his record lathe clean. He beats the strings, the chords radiating through the speakers. It's a tossed-off moment, certainly, but the anything-goes spirit validates what Kirton calls a sign of ""Fahey's experimental propensities."" Fahey was a restless listener, tinkerer, thinker, and player-- a combination that makes this set fascinating both as a history book and a lifetime listening indulgence.","This essential 5xCD, six-hour set features an 88-page book and the complete recordings the guitarist made for the Fonotone label between 1958 and 1965. It's not just for John Fahey zealots, it's for anyone interested in the story of American music.

Wasser Im Wind,Roedelius,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a3c0084474cd0c1e44/1:1/w_160/1ca19844.jpeg,2011-10-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15946-wasser-im-wind/,Bureau B,"In 1982, the groundbreaking German electronic group Cluster began an eight-year hiatus. Though the band was originally founded as Kluster in 1969 at Berlin's Zodiak Free Arts Lab under the leadership of Conrad Schnitzler, it quickly became the project of Dieter Mobius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Together, this pair created one of the most singular and distinguished catalogs in electronic music, often working with collaborators, including Brian Eno, Conny Plank, Michael Rother (with whom they had a side project called Harmonia), Holger Czukay, and Asmus Tietchens. By the time Cluster took a break, Roedelius was already nine albums into a parallel solo career, on which he'd developed his own brand of calm, inward-gazing ambient music. Odd, then, that on his second post-Cluster LP, 1982's Wasser Im Wind, he should have worked so diligently to sound a lot like Cluster. He dug out the Drummer One drum machine that was one of the group's signature sounds in its early days and crafted a series of keyboard sounds very similar to the ones he might have used in the early-to-mid 1970s. The resemblance is more than superficial, though. The convergence of strict, steady rhythm and drifting, amorphous melody on Wasser Im Wind has close relatives on Zuckerzeit and Sowiesoso. It's almost as if, one year removed from Cluster, he felt the need to go back and look around and make sure everything was still there. Think about going back to look at a house you lived in long ago, one that's been occupied by another family for years. Provided they haven't done some sort of tear-down, it's going to look familiar, and yet somehow off. The bush they removed, the tree they planted, the new siding they put on. When Roedelius goes back home to check on Cluster a year later, he doesn't quite find the place he remembers. One of the first sounds that collides with that ticky, sort of muffled drum machine programming is a few little figures tumbling out of the middle octaves of a piano, which points toward his later work, and on several tracks, he's joined by a saxophonist named Czjzek, who haunts these songs with a tone that sometimes makes his instrument sound strangely ancient. One of the most impressive things about the album is the variety Roedelius conjures using very basic ingredients. Drummer One may have been a limited machine, but he knew how to get a lot out of it, and he gets further mileage out of it by EQ-ing and tweaking the timbre of the clicks and thumps to make each beat feel very different. The standout track is ""Auf des Tigers Spur"", which goes some way toward predicting the complex ambient sound of the Orb's 1995 album Orbus Terrarum with its dense mix of pulses, drifting melodies, and sequenced melodic figures. Like the other songs, it rises and falls with no sharply defined beginning, middle, or end, but as you take in the album as a whole, there is something satisfying about that structure. These are songs that feel as though they shouldn't have sharp beginnings, middles, and endings: They lift the curtain and lower it again on something already in progress, something that could conceivably still be in progress.","Hans-Joachim Roedelius, co-founder of the groundbreaking German electronic group Cluster, first released this solo LP in 1982. Sonically, it's like he felt the need to return to Cluster, look around, and make sure everything was still there.

Bruiser,The Duke Spirit,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c9ea9e61561daa680f/1:1/w_160/7d5764a4.jpeg,2011-10-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15960-the-duke-spirit/,FictionShangri-La Music,"The Duke Spirit are a band you want to root for, blessed as they are with an alluring frontwowan (Liela Moss) and good taste (drawing on everything from 1980s UK indie to northern soul to murder ballads), but also a willingness to burnish those outsider sources with a considerable sass and swagger to bring the masses on-side. And yet, the masses have been mostly resistant to their charms-- the London group first surfaced in 2005 in the shadow of the similarly seedy but more widely celebrated Kills, while the ensuing years have seen upstart acts like the Joy Formidable emerging with more bombastic, attention-grabbing takes on shared noise-pop influences. The title of the Duke Spirit's third album would suggest they're tired of being relegated to second-class NME citizenry and ready to show the kids who's boss. But Bruiser-- produced by alt-rock spit-shiner Andrew Scheps-- feels oddly restrained, as the band sounds caught between the duelling desires to hold onto its grit-rock roots and to make its sound more sophisticated. The Duke Spirit have always attempted a tricky balancing act in their music--between the classic and the modern, the dissonant and the accessible, the decadent and the elegant-- but sometimes you wish they'd forsake this mode of controlled tension and give in to more extreme tendencies. Early singles ""Love Is an Unfamiliar Name"" and ""Cuts Across the Land"" weren't exactly textbook-definition ragers, but they still possessed a certain thrust, swing, and vigor; by contrast, Bruiser salvos ""Cherry Tree"" and ""Procession"" are set to lumbering, mid-tempo backbeats that don't provide the band with much opportunity to catch fire and push the Duke Spirit perilously close to run-of-the-mill mid-2000s modern rock. (The pomped-up power ballad ""Northbound"" doesn't do them any favors in that regard either, sounding a few years too late for an O.C. prom-scene placement.) But if Bruiser's more straightforward rock turns mostly disappoint (one notable exception: the late-game adrenaline shot ""Everybody's Under Your Spell""), the album does find the band showcasing its dynamic range in new and intriguing ways, from the winning ""Villain""-- the sort of sly, piano-rolled lullaby Nina Persson might've brought to a latter-day Cardigans or A Camp record-- to ""Sweet Bitter Sweet"", a solitary blues that blossoms into a theatrical show-stopper. Best of all is ""Bodies"", which makes great use of a stalking bassline and Moss' reverbed voice to set a grimly atmospheric scene, the creeping unease eventually manifesting itself into a powerful, almost stoner-metalesque surge. It's a rare instance where Bruiser lives up to its titular threat, but given this album's near-50/50 split between chugging rockers and elaborate, downcast balladry, it's safe to say that, at this point, the Duke Spirit are becoming ever more interested in cataloguing emotional wounds as leaving physical ones.","The title of the Duke Spirit's third album would suggest the London group's tired of being relegated to second-class NME citizenry and ready to show the kids who's boss.

Unto the Locust,Machine Head,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d6ea9e61561daa6824/1:1/w_160/521dda29.jpg,2011-10-26 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15978-unto-the-locust/,Roadrunner,"More than a decade after releasing 1994's Burn My Eyes, the groove metal group Machine Head, led by ex-Forbidden/Vio-lence guitarist Robb Flynn, won me back with their sixth album, the Grammy-nominated The Blackening. The 2007 effort made it onto my Show No Mercy year-end list and didn't leave my stereo for long stretches. It followed 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, a solid enough return to form that came on the heels of a couple of misdirected nu/rap-metal duds-- 1999's The Burning Red and 2001's Supercharger. Which is why The Blackening caught a lot of other folks off guard, too. Once someone flirts with Limp Bizkit territory (and then feuds with Fred Durst and friends), it's usually safe to stop paying attention. In that sense, The Blackening was a revelation. I was drawn to its ambitious sprawl and its dark, angry scowls; its impressive scope, melodies, vastness, and unexpected changes. There was no attempt to make it easy: The opener was close to 11 minutes long, the closer not much shorter, and a couple of the tracks went over nine. The sound, too, was huge-- enough so that, at the time, I said the Oakland group was more mainstream than my usual taste. I meant ""stadium-sized."" Album seven, Unto the Locust, is just as big as The Blackening, but it feels tighter, more easily digested, and yet somehow pleasingly rougher around the edges. As a whole, I ultimately prefer its predecessor, but Unto the Locust's highs go places only hinted at on the earlier collection. See, for instance, opener, ""I Am Hell (Sonata in C#)"", an eight-minute, three-movement anthem that starts, somberly, with a mass of a cappella voices, Flynn singing elegantly in Latin about a female arsonist. A few moments later, the band cruises into a violent explosion, Flynn's voice shifting into rawer thrash mode. This is the sort of transition that would be easy to fuck up, but Machine Head pull it off. From there, the seven-song, 50-minute collection slows down for a number of these sort of curve ball intros before breaking open into magisterial head-bangers. There are curious details worth pointing out-- overlapping guitar and cello, the repeated use of a string quartet, crazy time signatures, a Pink Floyd-style children's choir-- but none of this would matter much if the material weren't strong enough to contain these elements. (Machine Head are still very heavy, they've just done away with their earlier template.) Despite the length of these songs, Unto the Locust is focused, with memorable choruses, expressive riffs, escalating dynamics, and swarming instrumentation. Crunching floor punching shifts easily into acoustic madrigals. Classical moments turn into vintage thrash. The guitar solos are expressive and self-contained but deepen the rest of the track. Standout ""Be Still and Know"" opens with ultra-technical, dueling double soloing topped only by the track's huge chorus. There, and elsewhere, you get clean vocals messing with and cascading alongside raspy howls. At its best, this music is invigorating, urgent, necessary. Unto the Locust does fall off a bit toward the end, but that's largely because the first four tracks add up to just under 30 minutes of the most exciting metal you'll hear all year. (""Pearls Before the Swine"" is a solid enough thrasher and the anthemic closer ""Who We Are"" features the first use of kids in a rock context in ages that hasn't made me wince, though we could've done without the nu metal-ish ""Darkness Within"".) All told, like Master of Puppets-era Metallica, Machine Head are able to intelligently realize their ambition, weaving risky, progressive elements into the mix without forgoing their roots.","Though they once flirted with nu metal, Machine Head have settled into a more experimental and expansive place, with multi-part songs that make use of strings, choirs, and more.

"FAC. DANCE: Factory Records 12"" Mixes & Rarities 1980-1987",Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b7ea9e61561daa67f4/1:1/w_160/4466506e.jpeg,2011-10-26 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15963-fac-dance-factory-records-12-mixes-rarities-1980-1987/,Strut,"What does dance music sound like when it's made by people who seem slightly worried about the whole idea of dancing? What about people who are totally passionate about dance music even if it's not their native language, who can tackle it with the fearlessness of musicians who love something but aren't of it? Stateside, the music of Talking Heads is one answer. Along with a host of American artists from the same time, they carved out a unique interstice between rock and dance-- not quite one or the other. Fac. Dance goes some way to answering those questions from the UK's perspective, and it's probably no coincidence that some of it mines the same vein as Talking Heads before they discovered M.O.R. A collection of singles from (mostly) the early days of Factory Records, it's a glimpse of world where former wallflowers, whether one-time punks, or one-man avant acts suddenly found the possibilities of disco and post-disco club music too enticing to ignore. For some, those possibilities were purely musical, a new set of compositional ideas to explore and formal rules to bend or break. On their 1985 single ""Boss Toyota Trouble"", Manchester post-punks Biting Tongues, featuring future members of Simply Red, Yargo, and 808 State, sound like an industrial band who got its wigs flipped by Middle Eastern music and Ethiopian jazz and gamelan, but who couldn't quite shake the perversity that leads people to form industrial bands in the first place. Two inclusions from the Durutti Column are just jittery and uptempo variations on Vini Reilly's usual plangent and gorgeous brand of guitar-based instrumental music, seeming to have wandered in from a completely different compilation. In each case, the communal qualities of dance music get short-circuited, in both interesting and ""interesting"" ways, by artists too individualist to join any club night that'd have them as a member. And sometimes this formalist fucking around just leads to jokes that burn themselves as quickly as you'd expect. Experimental jazz-rock group Blurt founded by poet/puppeteer Ted Milton, for example, certainly earn their name, their 1980 track ""Puppeteer"" featuring an early hip-hop groove where the MC is replaced by an imitation of a mentally ill ranter who owns a cheap saxophone. It's a curious artifact of one of those rare moments when bands felt the compulsion to experiment with whatever was in the cultural air around them, but ultimately that's all it is, like a lot of the stuff collected here to pad things out to two discs (the inclusion of such tracks when the comp has nothing by New Order doesn't help). For other Factory artists, though, dance music became both an experiment in new sounds and their first real attempt to make records that met the needs of an audience who wanted to do more than nod with approval at the innovation on display. This is the impulse that animates the bulk of Fac. Dance, and it's why the compilation is worth hearing. Dance music can be many things, but to actually be dance music, it's got to be, you know, funky. You can't impede the groove, whether out of nervousness or perversity or indifference. What's most surprising is how many of these artists, a lot of them reared more on the pogo than the hustle, made these tracks into real-deal dance music that also served as experimental tape collages or extended trance-rock jams. Section 25's legendary but only intermittently available-for-purchase 1984 B-Side ""Looking From a Hilltop (Megamix)"" is, on one level, pure street-level electro of the glassy and inhuman sort that was everywhere in the early 1980s. But the tension comes from the way it seamlessly weaves in the abrasive, clanging post-punk Factory was first known for, jolting you out of dancefloor hypnosis without disturbing that groove. Section 25 and a few other Factory artists also helped not to break but to extend the rules enough to help create the next wave of dance. It's telling that Fac. Dance cuts off at 1987, a year before acid house took parts of Factory's later, compulsive, electro-driven sound and remade the dance mainstream. However out-there or abrasive it gets, much of Fac. Dance is also stuff that still worked for clubbers, mostly young ones hungry for something new, in New York and Detroit as much as Manchester and London, kids who saw group revelry as the whole point of pop. Note, for example, how many tracks here are the ""New York Mix"" version, with Factory also drafting in U.S. producers like Jellybean Benitez as the label's records became international DJ tools and its artists began making pilgrimages to New York studios to learn the ropes, often leaving any lingering trace of their punk past behind. One representative and truly obscure American inclusion, the Hood's 1987 cut ""Salvation! (Nitromix)"" is pure early freestyle/electro, that simultaneously most machine-driven and most pop brand of mid-80s dance, denigrated by old heads but integral to all the house and techno tweaks that would follow. Much of Fac. Dance probably wasn't considered ""true"" dance music by certain disco aesthetes at the time. But its fearlessness, its untrueness, helped in a small way to invent the future we're still living through.","This 2xCD collection of singles from Factory Records' early days offers a glimpse of a world where former wallflowers-- whether one-time punks or one-man avant acts-- found the possibilities of disco and post-disco club music too enticing to ignore.

Mylo Xyloto,Coldplay,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b3b1335d7bf169a311/1:1/w_160/74437e29.jpeg,2011-10-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15953-mylo-xyloto/,Parlophone,"""No one knows what it means, but it's provocative… gets the people going."" A couple of Chris Martin's good buddies memorably flipped this obscure bit of Blades of Glory dialogue on Watch the Throne to annotate the purchase of Margiela jackets, but it's every bit as applicable to the title of Mylo Xyloto and speaks toward Coldplay's lofty ambitions on it. A new Coldplay album is the sort of thing that's used as a health check for the record industry, and the band is very much aware that they could just release ""a new Coldplay album"" that would leave everyone involved satisfied-- this is essentially what happened on 2005's X&Y, their fastest seller and also their weakest LP according to many. But being criticized as bantamweight compared to peers like U2, R.E.M., or Radiohead has clearly worn on them-- and truth is, they're all the better for their guilty conscience about a total lack of post-punk credentials. While Coldplay will always be more enjoyable than groundbreaking and their artistic advances seen as smart troubleshooting than divine intervention, Mylo Xyloto works because the band once again manages to sound like Coldplay without sounding like any of their previous LPs, maintaining their stadium-spanning grandeur while subtly challenging preconceptions. While retaining the studio services and crucial cosign of Brian Eno, it's a relief that their most carefully thought-out work initially sounds less ambitious than Viva La Vida, a record whose orchestral and political bombast felt at the very least a necessary act of aggressive rebranding. Mylo Xyloto is brighter in both attitude and especially timbre, sleeker, more emphatic and up to the task of being a capital-E Event. Though their collaboration with Rihanna on ""Princess of China"" makes it all the more explicit, when you're at Coldplay's level, pop acts are your competition and Mylo places itself in a lineage of ultra-mainstream rock records spanning from Born in the U.S.A. to Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix-- swaddled in synths and gilded by state-of-the-art production, but never too off-putting if you still insist that ""real music"" is played by men with guitars. Indeed, the militant, pound-the-dashboard beat that powers ""Hurts Like Heaven"" sounds like the band jockeying for the Boss' nod of approval. It's a remarkably aerodynamic piece of all-purpose inspirational rock that never gets too pushy even with Martin's meaningful/meaningless proclamations (""You use your heart as a weapon/ And it hurts like heaven""), tweaking its classicist template with a slight Auto-Tune on the falsetto harmonies. Likewise, the imperial march of ""Paradise"" is wheelhouse Coldplay, as is Martin's unfortunate tendency to stretch out syllables for rhymes that really aren't worth saving. But its power has little to do with whatever Martin's going on about (dreaming of paradise, mostly)-- it's all about how they unabashedly flirt with contemporary R&B production, cranking the drums way up in the mix and the massing the vocals on the chorus to overwhelming, Pavlovian effect. They don't want to completely do away with Coldplay qua Coldplay-- they're still four normal-looking guys who introduced themselves with frail post-The Bends Britrock like ""Yellow"" and ""Trouble"". But they continually ask, why limit themselves to that? Of course, some of their limitations aren't really a matter of choice. While there's no shortage of venomous carping at Coldplay's expense, I've never heard anyone complain about Jon Buckland's guitar tone or the rhythm section not being up to snuff. All sonic tinkering aside, Martin is still a full-time target serving as the perfect avatar for Coldplay, undeniably well-meaning, painfully earnest, and lord, does he try. When Martin tells you that Mylo Xyloto is a conceptual love story inspired by the White Rose movement and The Wire, don't you at least believe that he believes it? So he's still a sucker for big parables told like he's the first to come up with them-- the innocence lost on the Muse-like stargazer ""Charlie Brown"" is documented awkwardly enough (""Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet/ Took a car downtown and took what they offered me""), even before you deal with the use of the Peanuts character as some sort of entry-level embodiment of adolescent purity. Likewise, though it's commendable that a multi-platinum band on its fifth record could make a swooning, waltz-time ballad called ""Us Against the World"" notable for not laying it on too thick, Martin pops off a line, ""Drunken like a Daniel in a lions' den,"" like someone who's somehow just managed to hear ""Hallelujah"" for the first time. Still, the collection of softies is among their best-- the measured beauty of breakup weeper ""Up in Flames"" and ""U.F.O."" confidently update the guilelessness of Parachutes through a self-described and self-explanatory ""Enoxification."" But maybe restraint's not what you're looking for out of a Coldplay album, and if that's the case, none of the ballads have the sort of shameless goosebump triggering of ""Fix You"" or ""The Scientist"". Which isn't to say that Mylo lacks populist thrill; it's just trying to mine alternative sources. They've sidled up toward music of more hedonistic ideals before, especially on A Rush of Blood to the Head; Martin's vocals on ""Clocks"" worked incredibly well filtered through dance remixes, while the ecstatic surge of ""Daylight"" really needed no translation. And thankfully, the revolutionary rhetoric of Mylo is based on love in this club rather than dope, guns, and fucking in the streets. The aforementioned ""Princess of China"" is an insistent, mechanized grind that fits just as easily on Mylo as the next Rihanna album, though it wouldn't be a single-- everyone seems to be taking it just a little too seriously. The important thing is that it'll sound great at the Grammys. And ""Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall"" will surely work well as a festival closer: As a call to arms, it's pretty much nonsense, Martin's already infamous ""I'd rather be a comma than a full stop"" threatening to bring ""Teardrop"" to a dead halt. But then you remember Coldplay aren't just Martin-- it's Will Champion's kick drum guiding its four minutes of skyward propulsion, one of the cruelly underrated Buckland's pealing, major-key guitar leads (think ""Strawberry Swing""), and, yes, Martin's wordless cooing coming together in a way that's sui generis Coldplay-- a band on top of a game they really don't have much competition in. These are the moments I think about when people lament the lack of a monoculture-- so often we speak of indie bands that ""should be huge"" and songs that ""could be hits"" in an alternate universe. But with ""Teardrop"" and ""Hurts Like Heaven"", there's a thrill of knowing these songs can, should, and will be on the radio that you just can't recreate. With all due respect, while M83 shoot for a similar extroverted exhilaration on Hurry Up, We're Dreaming-- the penultimate electro rush of ""Don't Let It Break Your Heart"" proves both bands are ever closer to intersecting-- the idea that it could fill arenas still involves wishful thinking. It's still one man's project, whereas Coldplay was built for this from day one. It shouldn't matter, but it does-- while so many bands at their status revert to bloated contentment or some vague idea of rockist salvation, Mylo Xyloto finds Coldplay successfully continuing to explore the tension of wanting to be one of the best bands in the world and having to settle for being one of the biggest.","While Coldplay will always be more enjoyable than groundbreaking, Mylo Xyloto works because the band once again manages to sound like Coldplay without sounding like any of its previous LPs.

He Thinks He's People,Rob Crow,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c2c0084474cd0c1e78/1:1/w_160/9a523b81.jpeg,2011-10-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15958-he-thinks-hes-people/,Temporary Residence,"Rob Crow owes us a new Pinback LP; that much, he knows. And the shadow of the California compulsive's most famous band's unfinished work seems to loom over He Thinks He's People, Crow's fourth solo effort. People got its start as something of a warm-up for Pinback's long-awaited follow-up to 2007's Autumn of the Seraphs; a relatively modest affair, at times almost seeming as though it's saving its strength. But, while People doesn't set its sights especially high, as another showcase of Crow's multifaceted, pinprick-pristine songcraft-- and a sort of low-key sneak preview of the new Pinback LP-- it's a small success. People primarily draws from murkily precise post-grunge and morose Elliott Smith-style balladry, cut with hints of hardcore, power-pop, and prog. Crow's laconic delivery gives the LP its distinctive mark; with a calm smirk, he centers the music, allowing a blast of spazz-punk to sit comfortably alongside a bit of intricate acoustic fretwork. Cloudy and labyrinthine at times, airy and placid elsewhere, People cuts a pretty wide swath, an approach that feels a bit more mature and confident than the bending over backwards he sometimes had to do to reach the disparate genres on his earlier solo records. But one can't quite shake the feeling that a lot of these songs haven't been given the fleshing out they should have. One of People's finest moment, Either/Or-nodding self-effacer ""Pat's Cabs"", matches a descending strum to a downtrodden melody that, halfway through, transforms itself, its quiet desperation taking a sharp turn toward the rousing. All this happens in just 65 seconds; then it's over, onto the chiming ""So Way"". This could've been the record's centerpiece, melodically rich and deeply moving; instead, it's something of a tease, just on the cusp of affecting. It's rare that Crow lets you get comfortable in a track before letting it veer into the next one, which-- when coupled with its frequent tone shifts-- lends the record a somewhat sketchbook-like quality. As ever, Crow is an impressive arranger, his claustrophobic compositions offer just enough room to uncoil, and even when the songs feel dashed-off, they rarely sound it. The driving ""Build"" isn't much of a tune, but it gets by on sheer propulsion. And while the knottier, Pinbackier stuff like ""Tranked"" or ""Prepare to be Mined"" don't quite affix themselves to your skull the way the best of that band's output can, one can certainly see why they were up for consideration. Sweeping post-punker ""Locking Seth Putnam in a Hot Topic"" (a tribute of sorts to the late Anal Cunt frontman) ushers in a late-LP shift that largely continues through the rickety ""I'd Like to Be There"" and the dewy sheen of ""Hangnailed"". This sequence finds Crow easing up on the tricky rhythms and the guitar tangles that are his stock-in-trade, drawing on Americana for inspiration, and bringing its dinger first half out into the late-afternoon light. These lilting, levity-imbued tunes never once feel like they're waiting on Crow to complete his thought, nor are they auditioning for a walk-on role in Pinback's next one; rather, they send the record out on a high, finally fixing on that warmth Crow sought from People. Now he's got some work to do.","The Pinback frontman's fourth solo LP feels like a preview of his main band's anticipated follow-up to 2007's Autumn of the Seraphs.

The Ann Steel Album,Roberto Cacciapaglia,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a8c0084474cd0c1e4c/1:1/w_160/371c3e8c.jpeg,2011-10-25 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15947-the-ann-steel-album/,Half Machine,"Pierre Henry, White Noise, and Bruce Haack were all touchstones cited by Animal Collective frontman Avey Tare when he discussed Roberto Cacciapaglia's The Ann Steel Album on Altered Zones in 2010. What binds the work of those artists with Cacciapaglia's intent for this album is a desire to funnel avant-garde influences into a robust future-pop sound. This record originally came out in 1979, just a few years after Giorgio Moroder was in his pomp with ""I Feel Love"", and during a time when the ""disco sucks"" campaign was gathering momentum. This isn't a disco record, but it leans hard on the kind of arpeggiated synths Moroder often favored, and occasionally acts as a precursor to the kind of spacey club jams Arthur Russell dabbled in around this time. It was certainly made during a period when dark clouds loomed over anything bridging the unholy triumvirate of dance, pop, and electronic music. Imagine Ann Magnuson of Bongwater teaming up with Russell in a dingy studio in Reagan-era New York City and you're close to grasping how The Ann Steel Album sounds. So who are Roberto Cacciapaglia and Ann Steel? The former is an Italian musician who specialized in electronic composition after starting his career in the early 1970s on the edges of the krautrock scene. The latter is a Michigan-bred singer who spun into Cacciapaglia's orbit during a trip to Italy in the 1970s to do some modeling. The Ann Steel Album is the one-off result of that happy accident, a record so full of joy that it's a surprise they weren't tempted to go back for another bite once it was in the can. But it's a credit to both of them that they knew when to stop, perhaps feeling that the sugary pop perfection of these recordings could never be replicated. There's a clunky charm to many of the synth sounds, most of which influenced bands like Stereolab and the perennially underrated Pram in future years; Steel even has a strain to her voice that's reminiscent of Pram singer Rosie Cuckston. There are two modes that Cacciapaglia and Steel flit between on this album. Mostly it's a precise brand of fizzy avant-electronica with a utopian edge to it (""My Time"", ""Media""), set to lyrics about metaphysics, Freud, Warhol, the media, candy bars, and a huge range of pop culture marginalia. Albert Einstein gets a mention in both of the first two tracks, preceding a brief trend for writing songs about him (Landscape, Big Audio Dynamite) in the 80s. The second type of song on The Ann Steel Album echoes the kind of ruminative electronic work Broadcast would pick up on in future years, with tracks like ""Quite Still"" and ""Sparkling World"" set around half-paced beats and blotchy keyboard noise. But it's in the upbeat work that the pair really excels, and the basic formula is often retooled to work in other elements such as the funk undertow of ""Portrait"" and the unabashed ABBA tributary of ""Media"", which give the album a broad range of colors that help overcome Steel's limited (and endearingly squeaky) voice. One of the strongest and most interesting songs comes at the center of the record in the shape of ""Measurable Joys"", which works as Cacciapaglia and Steel's paean to the completely synthetic world they long to inhabit. The lyrics condemn nature, punk, poetry, and even stained-glass windows, while praise is heaped on artifice, precision, technology, and TV. It's a song that works in two ways, both as a critique of the traditionalists crushing hard on the heels of musicians working in a certain strain of electronic music at the time, and as a harbinger of what was to come. After all, in a few years following The Ann Steel Album the pair almost got their wish, with the European charts awash with bands like Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, the Human League, and other starry-eyed forward thinkers. But this record works somewhere on the fringes of pop, as a distant cousin to commercially successful songs with an off-kilter hue like the Rah Band's ""Clouds Across the Moon"" or Dollar's ""Hand Held in Black and White"", where its reputation has deservedly grown to something approximating cult-classic status.","Italian electronic composer Roberto Cacciapaglia's one-off collaboration with Michigan singer Ann Steel funnels avant-garde influences into a robust future-pop sound.

Eyewash Silver,King Blood,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c79d034d5c69bf4a8a/1:1/w_160/602fa920.jpeg,2011-10-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15967-eyewash-silver/,Permanent Records,"There are at least two ways to look at a guitar riff-- as a building block for a song, or as an end in itself. Ryland Wharton, aka King Blood, has taken the latter viewpoint to a mesmerizing extreme. On Eyewash Silver-- originally released in a tiny edition in 2010-- he treats fuzzy guitar riffs not simply as ends, but as mantras to be chanted and monuments to be worshiped. Each track offers one simple figure devoutly repeated, as if musical nirvana is always just one more riff away. If I'm making Eyewash Silver sound too solemn or reverent, don't worry-- it's also a lot of fun. Wharton's clanging chords never feel dry or studied. Instead they're charged with an impulsive exuberance. Often it sounds like he came up with a guitar loop right before he hit record on his four-track, and was so excited that he didn't want to waste another second before churning away. That feel is enhanced by muddy, static-drenched production. The album drips with overload, creating a raw, gut-level immediacy. The idea behind each song is delivered unwashed and unrefined. In that sense, Eyewash Silver reminds me of Neil Young, particularly his solo guitar soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch's 1995 existential western Dead Man. Wharton's songs aren't nearly as sparse or forlorn as Young's score, but both share a near-anthropological fascination with the primal force of repeated notes. (Besides, the swinging hooks of ""Poison in Jest"" and ""Sinfull Woman"" sound extracted and extended from Crazy Horse tunes). You'll hear other reference points throughout Eyewash Silver-- the noisy wash of Japanese bands like Fushitsusha and Les Rallizes Denudes, the motor-garage of Wooden Shjips, and, on the near-perfect ""End of a Primitive"", the classic amp-melt of great Velvet Underground bootlegs. But I keep coming back to Young and his exploratory wanderings, a standard to which Wharton measures up well. The only flaw you might find in Eyewash Silver is the claustrophobic effect its relentless distortion can create. Sometimes after I've listened to it repeatedly, it's taken me a while to shake the feeling that I'm wearing earmuffs. But this also gives the album a world-apart feel-- it's unlikely you'll get distracted by anything else while this album is on. Besides, even if you can't bear to hear King Blood over and over, one listen to its echoing riffs might make you feel like you have.","Ryland Wharton, aka King Blood, treats fuzzy guitar riffs not simply as ends, but as mantras to be chanted and monuments to be worshiped. The clanging chords, charged with an impulsive exuberance, are also a lot of fun.

DJ-Kicks,Scuba,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18513d197565213a621/1:1/w_160/e4fd4874.jpeg,2011-10-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15928-dj-kicks/,!K7,"There's been no shortage of dialogue around how dubstep has exploded and splintered into countless fragments-- disparate but still interlinked shards reflecting shades of techno, house, garage, drum'n'bass and everything else under the sun. English-born Paul Rose has historically been one of the earliest agents of this dubstep disintegration, making the move to techno haven Berlin early and establishing an interest in the genre that soon became commonplace among many of his genre contemporaries. Founding what would become one of the leading institutions in the techno/dubstep fusion with his Hotflush Recordings label and unprecedentedly landing a residency at the world's most infamous techno club, Berghain, Rose-- better known as Scuba, SCB, or Spectr-- has been a leading light in dissolving the boundaries between different worlds of dance music. But no matter how experimental or cross-boundary this particular sphere of music gets, there's always a line drawn between all these iterations of ""bass music"" and what might be considered ""proper"" techno and house. It's the reason why Rose splits his time between Scuba (bass music) and SCB (straight-up techno), why his memorable RA podcast was a ""versus"" between his alter egos, and why his SUB:STANCE club night happens on Fridays at Berghain and not Saturdays. It's the reason why his only previous commercial mix CD as Scuba focused almost exclusively on dubstep-centric sounds with none of SCB trickling in. But all bets are off with Rose's contribution to the long-running DJ-Kicks series, where that border fence between ""bass"" and techno is finally demolished. Mixing genres isn't anything out of the ordinary anymore (in fact, it's pretty much expected), but rarely do we see this kind of flitting between extremes in such a small and confined space. I'm tempted to say that the overarching theme here is techno, but it's a weird sort of techno. Even when we get big names like Surgeon and Marcel Dettmann, we're not given chunky workouts or sleek, streamlined bangers, but the militarist thrust of ""The Power of Doubt"" and the jerky IDM of ""Captivate"". Rose prefers these album cuts over easily more functional single material from either producer, which says a lot about his outside-the-box approach here. Forgoing both the instant-gratification quick mixing of bass music DJs and the lengthy blends of Berlin techno jocks, the tracks feel like they're melting in and out of each other, which means their generic signifiers melt away as well. Rose's style is a fastidious ebb and flow of microscopic beat-stitching. Structurally, Scuba's DJ-Kicks throws another curveball: It doesn't build toward any particular climax, nor is it centered around the ""drop"" structure inherent to most bass music. The closest we get are the bits of warm melody that seep in with tracks like Braille's jazzy ""Breakup"" or Mr. Beatnick's elegant G-funk epic ""Don't Walk Away From My Love"". Lately Rose's own productions have been moving into house territory, slowing below even the accepted median ""bass"" tempo of 130 beats per minute (as theorized by Pitchfork's own Martin Clark). What this means is that his mix plays the aural illusion of actually slowing down over the course of its duration: where most DJs would gradually ratchet up the tempo, Rose drags it down from a healthy 132 BPM to a leisurely 125, right where his newest tracks sit. The descent is deceptive, because the mix comes closer to anthemic as it slows: The CD-exclusive ""M.A.R.S"" is an uncharacteristically happy-go-lucky banger, and it's followed by a rousing selection of house producers like Recondite, Jichael Mackson, and Rivet, previously unassociated with either Scuba or SCB. No late-2011 Scuba mix would be complete without his controversial ""Adrenalin"", and DJ-Kicks finally delivers it. The track is given a five-minute spotlight, a gratuitous move for an equally gratuitous track touching on the untouchable: The pariah genres of prog house and trance are fastened with the most decadent breakdown you've heard since you used to listen to Sasha. Leaving ""Adrenalin"" to the end of the mix is perhaps the only predictable moment on Paul Rose's DJ-Kicks, a disc that's otherwise determined in its mission to keep you on your toes, knitting complex percussive webs and blending genres at a reckless rate that feels like a new gold standard for an already bled-through music world. It might be just a mix CD, but Scuba's DJ-Kicks is a landmark both personal and scene-wide. It shouldn't come as a surprise though, because Paul Rose is just leading the pack like he's always done.","The founder of the influential Hotflush label here crafts a satisfying mix that finds him moving seamlessly between bass music and techno proper, carving out a middle ground that feels oddly fresh.

"Audio, Video, Disco",Justice,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c19d034d5c69bf4a85/1:1/w_160/7975e1a0.jpeg,2011-10-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/,Ed Banger,"Let's get something out of the way: prog. As in, it's impossible to discuss Justice's sophomore album, Audio, Video, Disco without noting just how thoroughly the Parisian duo has adopted the brash sounds of late-1970s progressive rock. The referents-- Yes for turbulent guitar lines, Goblin for sly italo beats, Queen for unapologetic bombast-- jump off the plastic, announcing that Justice will not re-hash the ornery, clubby obelisks that defined †. Their new direction is precocious, brave, and surprising even if it damns them by placing emphasis on qualities-- arrangement, fidelity, patience-- that Justice lack. Though it sparked a still-running debate about the duo's credentials, †, by accessing unexplored levels of sleaze and cheese, actually fit into dance music's long, proud tradition of not giving a fuck. That they did this in a rock context-- leather jackets; big live show; loud, terrible mastering-- seemed at the time reverent of peak-era Daft Punk but in retrospect appears prescient: Deadmau5 and Skrillex headline festivals, hellbent on teasing out the most seizure-inducing mix of lighting and music possible. In 2011 anyone looking to beef about ""real"" dance music stares into a smaller barrel filled with bigger fish. In this way, AVD is a natural progression for Justice. Their M.O. is bold irreverence, and they've found multiple ways to express it. Still, it's hard not to admire their choice: It threatens to alienate their core audience while endearing them to a group of fans unlikely to take up their cause (or realize they exist). Prog-rock has long been championed by experimental music fans for its complexity and ambition-- it was outsider art that made the mistake of actually selling records. Prog remains a mostly unclaimed orphan of rock history, and while certain corners of the indie establishment-- Fiery Furnaces, Sufjan Stevens, Dirty Projectors-- have adopted its structure and imagination, they've left the flute solos behind. (Dance acts like Aeroplane and Wolfram have mined this territory to mixed effect.) Justice take the opposite tack: AVD is composed of short, simple tracks stuffed with stairway-climbing solos, ascendant male vocalists, and starry-skied bridges. The duo has called AVD a ""daylight"" album, presumably in contrast with †'s nocturnal vibe. But just like a low-lit club can mask flaws, Justice's full-bore wall-of-dance bulldozed some of their compositional shortcomings. AVD is brighter and more diffuse (though, sadly, its recording style is no more dynamic), but the light shining through does Justice no favors. It's easy to admire progressive rock for its immersion and commitment to concept, as well as its musical prowess and scope. These are, sadly, the elements Justice strip away. Instead, they employ prog's sounds in short, distracting bursts, filling AVD with melodies that are curious but difficult to remember or enjoy. They do this in the style they know how-- with hoary, space-eating electronics-- which suggests supreme digital craftsmanship but doesn't do the listener any favors. The guitars sounds are uniformly shrill, the bass flatulent, the rhythms rudimentary. They employ singers more frequently than on †: male voices, pinched and bleating. I won't do you the disservice of examining their lyrics (they're hardly the point, for Justice or for us), but suffice to say they don't add much. AVD's finest moment is the title track, in which a voice is digitally manipulated into a current of high-strung, winsome tunefulness. ""Helix"", their most blatant disco move, is robotically funky, a reminder of what Justice are capable of when they commit fully to Daft pyrotechnics. The majority of AVD, though, is cheese-rock signifiers dressed up as dance music. Once you get over the fact that the band got a little Cerrone in your ""Kashmir"" (""On'n'on"") or spiked your Moroder with Toto (""Horsepower"") there's little reason to come back to AVD. Immersing yourself in the record is an exercise in liking Justice as a concept more while liking their actual output less. There's too much space between AVD and actual prog to accept that Justice are committed to this direction. They spent all their daring on concept, with little to spare for execution. Even for a duo as image-conscious and savvy as these guys, there is little style in their reduction.","On their second full-length, the French production duo incorporates the brash sounds of late-1970s progressive rock. The direction is precocious, brave, and surprising even if it amplifies their weak points.

(I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson,Stevie Jackson,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a4c0084474cd0c1e47/1:1/w_160/c6cd24b7.jpeg,2011-10-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15939-i-cant-get-no-stevie-jackson/,self-released,"Stevie Jackson joined Belle and Sebastian about 15 years ago, and he's been playing hard to get ever since. As guitarist-vocalist for Glasgow's preeminent indie pop outfit, Jackson typically contributes only a track or two per LP. While frontman Stuart Murdoch has been busy with new project God Help the Girl, and former bandmate Isobel Campbell has put out album after album with gravelly-voiced collaborator Mark Lanegan, Jackson has pretty much limited his extracurricular activities to covers, soundtrack work, and instrumental appearances. If Jackson's solo debut is overdue, though, it's also disappointingly undercooked. Sure, (I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson sounds a lot like what Belle and Sebastian fans might expect, with tinges of 1970s singer-songwriter records, bucolic late-1960s British pop, and, yup, showtunes. Put together intermittently since 2006 with fellow B&S members and a few longtime friends, these 12 songs feel like whimsical larks, and Jackson's considerable charm should be able to put them over just fine in a live setting. But the record can also be too whimsical for its own good, and for most listeners, Jackson's Belle and Sebastian songs will be enough. Chalk it up, perhaps, to yet another case of a solo artist's gifts working better with a band. In the context of last year's Write About Love, Jackson's ""I'm Not Living in the Real World"" is as accomplished as it is crazy for key changes. Here, when Jackson channels Elton John while proclaiming that he's ""Pure at Heart"", tosses off literary puns over ambling ""Mellow Yellow"" psych-pop, and coos, ""Along came a bigger bird/ More bigger than he,"" amid twee-pop orchestration-- all on the same album-- it's a little tougher to take. When he jauntily narrates the potential pitfalls if you ""Press Send"" on an email to an object of your affection, context isn't the problem. On a musty tape somewhere, there must be a forgotten Jens Lekman song that brings this stale theme to wittier, more vivid life. That said, Jackson has long since proved himself to be more than merely an adept sideman, and he flashes glimmers of those skills here. Jittery preview track ""Try Me"" skirts the album's occasionally narrow topical concerns (two songs loosely about directors, one about a redevelopment project) and dippy faux-innocence (""He was my best friend at school...""). Instead, Jackson homes in neatly on a rich, distinctive emotional state-- ""I got pills and I'm looking for thrills/ At the same time I want to start a family""-- and an equally well-developed organ-rock sound that builds on predecessors like ? and the Mysterians, the Clean, and Love Is All. This one's definitely worth the attempt. The new album's other preview track, the string-splashed, many-voiced ""Man of God"", comes closest to the Jesus Christ Superstar theatricality of The Life Pursuit songs like ""Act of the Apostle"". Only appropriate, given the title. Here, though, Jackson dodges some of the new record's pitfalls with yet another droll piece of songwriting: The religious imagery turns out to be just an unlikely setting for a music fan's doomed attempt to seduce through the strength of his record collection. Thankfully, Jackson doesn't make that mistake on (I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson. Still, there's a disconnect between this fair-to-middling solo record and the vital role its creator plays in one of the indie world's truly singular ensembles.","The Belle and Sebastian guitarist-vocalist's solo debut sounds like what fans might expect, with tinges of 1970s singer-songwriter records, late-1960s British pop, and showtunes.

Rising Doom,Mondkopf,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b189c0084474cd0c1e1d/1:1/w_160/53da35fa.jpeg,2011-10-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15924-mondkopf-rising-doom/,Fool House,"Mondkopf is a French artist with a German name, which is fitting, given how often his productions play in a middle ground between those two countries' archetypal modes of electronic music. Looked at a certain way, Rising Doom, the 24-year old's latest full-length and first for Fool House, the label imprint of French fashion/mp3 blog Fluokids, borrows the machine muscle of harsh Teutonic techno and leavens it with just a bit of the joviality and melody of French touch. Of course, genre divides don't break down cleanly along national lines. German and French electronic music have long been in close conversation-- especially in recent years, with crossover acts like Digitalism or the Ed Banger roster frequently blurring the lines, or with UK dubstep usurping the conversation altogether. And while Rising Doom is no more dubstep than it is minimal or filter house, it might actually be British bass music's mutations that make the single largest mark on the album. This is most apparent in terms of overall mood. From the name Rising Doom to track titles that sound like weightier Dr. Who episodes (""Where the Gods Fall"", ""The Song of Shadows"", ""Day of Anger"") on down to the creeping stereo synths and stalking drum-machine beats, the album is permeated by the kind of ominousness and menace that is increasingly the currency of dubstep as it goes teenage testosteroned and mainstream. Which would grate or bore if it weren't also so meticulously sculpted. Rising Doom is full of the kind of 3-D sound design, melodramatic melodic arcs, and chest-thumping bass beats that might make Mondkopf's closest peers in terms of pure sonics the German duo Modeselektor, especially on songs like the staticky, synth-sawing ""Day of Anger"", although its classical-sounding piano bookends recall something else entirely. Other audio-engineering showpieces include the muffled haunted-house organs and big-room shuffle of ""Deadwood"", or ""Where the Gods Fall"", which-- with its lurching rhythm, shushing, shrill-as-hell hi-hat slicing, and mid-frequency rave synths stabbing in the background-- might be the closest thing here to a proper dubstep track. This stuff can turn ponderous, though, as on the nine-minute-long closer ""Fossil Lights"", a half-time fade-out which strains for the sort of cinematic epic of an M83 coda but ends up feeling incidental. He sometimes succumbs to this sort of well-crafted sound for its own sake, rather than in the service of either a memorable song or a physically functional track.","Mondkopf is a French artist with a German name, which is fitting: The 24-year old's latest full-length borrows the harsh machine muscle of Teutonic techno and leavens it with French electro's archetypal joviality and melody.

Let the Poison Out,The Beets,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b6c0084474cd0c1e64/1:1/w_160/f88f2a26.jpeg,2011-10-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15954-let-the-poison-out/,Hardly Art,"Earlier this year, in an interview published shortly after the release of Stay Home, Beets principles Juan Wauters and Jose Garcia revealed that the writing for their next album had already been completed. This is far from a surprising development in the world of garage-rock, where most bands worth their weight in Nuggets compilations are prone (or, at the very least, prepared) to release two albums, five 7"" and 12"" singles, and maybe even a tour-only cassette as a forget-me-not in the span of about nine months. Being prolific is not a minor miracle in garage so much as it is muscle memory; the defining trait of this style of music is that it's not incredibly difficult to compose. This is especially true of the Beets, a band who tours the Continental 48 in a station wagon, whose cover art is exclusively drawn with crayons. You get the impression that a Beets song takes about as much time to write and record a song as it takes Beets album artist Matthew Volz to run to Walgreens and get a 64-color box of Crayolas. What would probably be considered an insult to most other bands is part and parcel to the Beets' charm. Much like their heroes Ramones-- a band namedropped in Howard Stern's brief on-air appraisal of the band-- the Beets are long on attitude. On their debut, Spit in the Face of People Who Don't Want to Be Cool, the album's title served equally well as a mission statement. When the production quality of your record is equivalent to a damp fast food napkin, attitude is pretty much all you have to go on. Spit in the Face was intriguing and enjoyable because it was a lot like watching a band playing through a garage door made of opaque glass: You couldn't tell exactly what they were doing, but you wanted to be a part of it anyway. Let the Poison Out continues the band's gradual crawl out of the basement, and with the added sonic clarity comes the best collection of songs Wauters has written. Granted, the chords haven't ventured into jazzy diminished sevenths-- nor has the band decided to use a full drum kit to play its songs-- but the album showcases the Beets as a band every bit as off-the-cuff as it has been, though far more distinctive. With Wauters' voice pushed to the forefront, the bratty scream-singing of Spit in the Face of People Who Don't Want to Be Cool and Stay Home makes way for heavily accented-- and, in the case of ""Wipe It Off"", intentionally broken-- English, something undetected on past Beets records, where the vocals either sat among or were buried underneath the thudding drums. In general, Wauters is working with a broader songwriting palette. Adding to various Beets traditions-- the tune sung in Spanish (""Preso Voy""), the loopy, experimental interlude (""Eat No Dick 3"")-- he boasts a love for stream-of-consciousness imagery on opener ""You Don't Want Kids to be Dead"", offers sage advice on ""Doing as I Do"", and plays a lovelorn game of ""this or that"" on ""I Don't Know"". The record also marks the addition of drummer Chie Mori, whose plaintive anti-harmonies augment Wauters' singing in a way that recalls a less irksome version of the Moldy Peaches. The boy-girl vocals do more than just add to the pop bliss of the record's more infectious moments: ""Friends of Friends"" is made rowdier by Mori's contributions, while her backing vocals on quasi-psychedelic closer ""Walking to My House"" give the song a skewed and eerie vibe. The Beets' newfound focus on recording quality could have easily highlighted shortcomings, but instead, the band found a way to broaden its sound by recruiting a member who exponentially adds to its worth.","On their newest LP, the prolific Queens garage rockers add a new drummer and continue their gradual crawl out of the basement. With the added sonic clarity come the best songs frontman Juan Wauters has written.

Tarot Classics EP,Surfer Blood,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b95e6ef95969322199/1:1/w_160/7badeb02.jpeg,2011-10-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15962-tarot-classics/,Kanine,"""I'm not ready to look the other way,"" Surfer Blood frontman John Paul Pitts lets loose halfway through ""I'm Not Ready"". So it would seem. ""Ready"" launches Tarot Classics, Surfer Blood's first proper release since early 2010's Astro Coast. Title aside, it's a modest effort, four sturdy pop-rockers, 15 easy minutes. Blithely confident, Astro Coast's sunsoaked power-pop found Surfer Blood blowing through one breezily bulbous hook and escapist lyric after another. Tarot Classics finds Surfer Blood throwing a little shade. With its so-bright-you'll-squint melody and bummer-in-the-summer vibe, ""I'm Not Ready"" would've fit just fine almost anywhere on Astro Coast. But its crisp handclaps and neon guitars belie a serious compositional sophistication, a seemingly endless string of bridges charting the path to the song's bounding hook. ""Your mouth is running off now that you've seen a few things,"" Pitts admonishes, and ""don't get too big for your britches"" seems in some ways Tarot Classics' guiding principle. As on Astro Coast, they seem confident in their every move but unwilling to take on more than they can handle. First single ""Miranda"" is a bit of a blur, highlighted by its a rousing guitar break, its one-word chorus (hint: it's a girl's name), and a more-than-passable Morrissey impression from Pitts. The hints of Anglophilia that emerge on ""Miranda"" and through the rest of Tarot Classics are, in many ways, their biggest step away from the distinctly American roots (Beach Boys, Weezer, Cheap Trick) of Astro Coast. Pitts' voice wears this somewhat dolorous tone every bit as well as he did Astro Coast's shouty Brian Wilsonisms, and the band follows suit, lending a richly textured, slightly overcast New Romantic lean to the proceedings that feels deeper-- if a bit less retina-searing-- than the brasher Astro Coast. ""Voyager Reprise"" takes off slowly, eventually settling into a shuffly, somewhat morose melody and dance-night-at-the-pub groove pitched somewhere between the Strokes and those early Cure singles. It's aching melody amplified by that newfound gravity in Pitts' voice, ""Voyager"" certainly feels like Surfer Blood's first truly sad song, the longing in its simply stated chorus impossible to miss. Closer ""Drinking Problem"" is alternately Tarot Classics' highlight and its least characteristic track, a lush, staggering bit of New Romantic pop that finds Pitts switching out the Moz for a Bernard Sumnerian swoon not unlike that of Kisses frontman Jesse Kivel. A shimmering synth melody buoys the aching Pitts, reassuring himself with, ""at least I know who my friends are,"" every utterance sounding less and less convinced of itself. A year and change on the road finds Pitts seeming a bit guarded, picking at the long-term scars of short-term affairs, questioning everyone's motivations, starting with his own. But if he's undergoing some crisis of confidence, it's not shared by his bandmates; like Astro Coast, Tarot Classics' popcraft proves well beyond promising, and these songs are certainly sturdy enough to handle their lusher productions and knottier sentiments. Tarot Classics once again fixes the spotlight on Surfer Blood's insidious melodies, refining-- rather than reconfiguring-- their self-possessed sound. It's still summer where Surfer Blood come from, it's just a little colder there now.","The Florida band's first proper release since early 2010's Astro Coast is a modest effort featuring four sturdy pop-rockers that breeze by in 15 easy minutes and introduces a bit of Anglophilia into the power pop mix.

Bad as Me,Tom Waits,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ba9d034d5c69bf4a77/1:1/w_160/581ce09c.jpeg,2011-10-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15961-bad-as-me/,Anti-,"Back when The Old, Weird America, Greil Marcus' expansive treatise on Bob Dylan's 1967 collaboration with the Band, was first published in hardcover in 1997 (the same year, incidentally, that Smithsonian Folkways reissued Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music), it was called Invisible Republic. It was an apt, even poignant title that still never managed to evoke half the wistfulness its paperback replacement did. Marcus' disciples quickly rallied around the new phrase, adopting it as a kind of credo, a genre, and an aspirational aesthetic that owed as much to Robert Frank and Jack Kerouac as it did to Charley Patton and the Carter Family.  And while collective cultural nostalgia (for times real or imagined) has become part of the zeitgeist, longing for a dusty and peculiar past-- for the misbegotten and the unfussed-with, the archaic and the odd-- isn't a particularly new phenomenon. Marcus sought and found those things in pre-war vernacular American music, in the songs Smith culled from his crates of 78s and gathered under a Celestial Monochord. Tom Waits hears them everywhere. Bad as Me is Waits' first proper collection of studio material since 2004's Real Gone (in 2006, he released Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards, a 3xCD mélange of lost-and-found tracks). He's backed by a cabal of familiar, gnarly-faced noisemakers (David Hildalgo, longtime bandleader Marc Ribot, Keith Richards, Flea), and again shares writing and producing credit with his wife and frequent collaborator Kathleen Brennan. Waits' jerky grandpa bark, which he'd honed and perfected by his mid-twenties, was reverse-engineered to age well. Now, perhaps freed from the burden of approximation, he sounds especially wild and gleeful, hollering with deranged aplomb. Bad as Me is as essential-- and as essentially weird-- as anything he's done before. Bad as Me comprises mostly love songs: paeans to lasting love, the kind that changes and bends. Even when Waits is yearning for freedom, as he does on the drunk and twitchy ""Get Lost"", he still wants his longtime girl by his side. ""When you wear that real tight sweater/ You know I can't resist/ It's been that way forever baby/ Ever since we kissed,"" he croons, his voice raw and giddy; he sounds like a guy who was pummeled by a car, got up, staggered off, and started singing. On the title track, over piano, baritone sax, and spastic guitar stabs, he celebrates mutual failure (""You're mother superior in only a bra/ You're the same kind of bad as me""), positioning compatible sin as its own triumph over circumstance.  Elsewhere, he adheres to old-fashioned ideals about the ""power of a good woman's love,"" lamenting, as he does on the ramshackle ""Raised Right Men"", the ways in which imperfect husbands (""Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George, Ice Pick Ed Newcomb"") routinely fail their partners. None of this is particularly new lyrical or musical fodder for Waits, and, nearly 20 records in, he's clearly locked into a formula-- however atypical, however idiosyncratic-- he's not particularly keen to abandon (read enough interviews, and you'll also see him trotting out the same stock punchlines-- and you'll still laugh). Still, he does push his voice here, and to wildly gratifying ends. On ""Talking at the Same Time"", a woozy, horn-accented shuffle (it evokes Ennio Morricone, David Lynch, Alice in Wonderland), he adopts a soft, wheezing falsetto, while on ""Pay Me"", he sounds docile and sleepy, like he's singing from bed (it's a heartbreaking choice for a track that contains the admission, ""They pay me not to come home""). As with any Tom Waits album, there are a few absurd affectations at work, both on record and off (in a recent New York Times profile, Waits is caught driving a black Suburban with a newspaper announcing the inauguration of John F. Kennedy spread across the passenger seat) but there's enough variation here that all that oldness and weirdness-- all those frantic, busted melodies, all that carnie growl, all those sarsaparilla bottles banging around the backseat-- never gets tiresome. For all his indulgences, Waits never lingers too long; these tracks are concise and expertly edited, and Bad as Me feels as new as it does ancient.","Featuring contributions from longtime bandleader Marc Ribot, Keith Richards, and Flea, among others, Bad as Me is Tom Waits' first proper collection of studio material since 2004's Real Gone. He doesn't veer from his established sound, but the songwriting is as strong as ever.

Glowing Mouth,Milagres,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a7c0084474cd0c1e4a/1:1/w_160/3eb2edbe.jpeg,2011-10-21 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15949-glowing-mouth/,Kill Rock Stars,"Milagres are from Brooklyn but they seem like a ""Brooklyn band"" in ways that that extend beyond geography. Despite those zeitgeisty triangles on the album cover, their debut LP, Glowing Mouth, brings to mind that period between 2005 and 2009, when the borough pumped out earnest rock bands that embraced ornate, occasionally anthemic song structures and on-the-cusp-of-turning-30 neuroses. Needless to say, things have changed since then, as James Murphy's decade-old jab about how ""your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables"" has more or less become reality (again). One of Brooklyn's remaining guitar bands, Real Estate, aren't really from Brooklyn, and elsewhere you're more likely to find piles of synthesizers and stoner-friendly visuals at a D.I.Y. show, anyway. Even that bastion of wistful, distanced indie-pop, Captured Tracks, has taken a turn toward largely embracing the harsh synth minimalism of coldwave. The sepia-toned M.O.R. Glowing Mouth, then, is almost tailor-made for those nostalgic for the days when nostalgia wasn't indie culture's M.O.-- or, for when tickets to see Grizzly Bear weren't too expensive. Calling Milagres ""fussy"" is only half the story, though. Glowing Mouth represents something of a collective split personality within the band, and they're at their best when embracing the high-stakes theater of emotional, mainstream rock. A recent article in The Guardian compared Milagres to Coldplay, which is half right, since if Milagres were half as playful and unabashedly romantic as Coldplay, they'd be a much more interesting band. There is a sort of distinctly British world-weariness to lead singer Kyle Wilson's voice, though, swinging and swaying toward the rafters while still retaining an elegant, low-level misery. A times, they recall the stronger points of Elbow's catalog (witness album closer ""Doubted"", where Wilson sounds like a slightly weakened dead ringer for Guy Garvey). If you've spent more than a minute of your life defending Doves, there are moments on Glowing Mouth that are pure catnip. In the end, though, it's Grizzly Bear's influence that looms largest over Glowing Mouth. There's plenty that brings Yellow House to mind, from the cavernous surroundings to the jagged, obtuse guitars on ""For Disposal"". Like records by Grizzly Bear, St. Vincent, and the National, nothing feels out of place on Glowing Mouth; it's precise and hermetically sealed to perfection, the kind of reasonably competent mid-2000s mainstream indie that inevitably finds an audience, no matter how small and blog-specific. But while Milagres may sound like a lot of music fans' favorite bands, it's hard to imagine anyone preferring this record to the real deal.","This Brooklyn quintet's debut LP evokes a time when their borough regularly pumped out earnest bands that embraced ornate, occasionally anthemic song structures. But they're at their best when embracing the high-stakes theater of emotional mainstream rock.

Follow Your Heart,Cubic Zirconia,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a913d197565213a654/1:1/w_160/4ea68d1d.jpeg,2011-10-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15948-cubic-zirconia-follow-your-heart/,Fool’s Gold,"Fake-diamond punchlines aside-- and on a label called Fool's Gold, no less-- there's something hard to shake about the all-surface nature of Cubic Zirconia's floss. Here's a group from New York that shoots for a Basement Jaxx-caliber house/funk crossover, one that rides on the presence of a singer who paid her dues alongside Detroit rap'n'B artists Platinum Pied Pipers, mutant-disco purveyors the Phenomenal Handclap Band, and post-dubstep architect Kingdom. Cubic Zirconia set their sights on a genre-demolishing, universal club-hopper soundtrack that's aimed to fuse altered-state headrush and restless libido in ways that made those two sensations feel inseparable. And after surveying the crowded field of all-purpose post-hip-hop/post-electro dance music, they set about figuring out what parts to draw from to synthesize it all into the only album in the field that anybody would need to own. The end result of all this is Follow Your Heart, and it's the most frustrating kind of retro-pastiche. This is one of those albums that attempts to fuse multiple instances of the familiar instead of trying to coax underheard and unusual ideas out of a single deeper vein. There's a dominant, vaguely 1980s feel about it, and even if there's some loosely hinted signs of picking up a particular inspiration from the big three mid-American hotspots of the era-- Minneapolis, Detroit, and Chicago-- they're rolled out with what feels like the musical equivalent of received wisdom, letting experienced listeners fill in the blanks in the hope that the blanks aren't the only thing they hear. You like frenetic, high-concept synthesized funk à la Prince? See if you can cope with the way ""Freebase You"" and ""Runnin' in and Out of Love"" siphon it into a nuance-free piledriver. Think acid/techno fusion is interesting? The title track provides the absolute basic clichés of that potential and lets it ride out on autopilot. You want an aloof, slightly off singer muttering come-ons and empty debauched phraseology over electro homages that don't sound much different as 30-year throwbacks than they did as 20-year throwbacks? ""Cherry Nights"" and ""Yellow Spaceship Pt. 2"" have you covered. The singer in question, Tiombe Lockhart, is not untalented-- there are some flashes of charisma and fuck-what-you-think oddness that sneak through during odd moments in Follow Your Heart. But there's this sort of semi-intentional Teflon aloofness to her voice, and for the most part her notes just kind of drone out instead of soaring or piercing or hitting with any real impact. For most singers, that detached, flat, and affectless tendency can sound either cool or empty depending on the surrounding production. So when it's hard to tell how much depth the backing track's supposed to have, it's also hard to suss out any real emotion from that pro-forma deadpan, whether she's quipping about ""writing a neo-soul song"" on the exact opposite thereof in electro workout ""Darko"" or making lovestruck euphoria sound mildly diverting on ""Take Me High"". It only becomes more obvious when she's pitted against someone with some chops (Bilal providing subtly rich harmonies on ""Night or Day"") or an actual personality (Dâm-Funk going all-out on ""I Got What You Need""). And when you pair that voice and those beats with similarly placeholder-feeling lyrics-- ""Summertime"" actually follows up the couplet, ""Never makes me feel bad/ Never makes me feel sad,"" with the line, ""Every time I see you my heart skips a beat""-- it's enough to make you wonder if trendy NYC dance music's found a way to run on aggregators.","This New York dance outfit's LP is the most frustrating kind of retro-pastiche, one of those albums that tries to fuse multiple instances of the familiar instead of coaxing underheard and unusual ideas out of a single deeper vein.

Takes Place in Your Work Space EP,White Denim,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b49d034d5c69bf4a71/1:1/w_160/de8c9f62.jpeg,2011-10-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15956-white-denim-takes-place-in-your-workplace/,Downtown,"Taking it easy doesn't seem to come naturally to White Denim. They've been an ongoing concern only since 2007, yet they already have five LPs and just as many EPs (and a handful of singles) to their credit. However, unlike other similarly prolific acts like Guided by Voices or Thee Oh Sees, where the energy to write and record all those songs doesn't necessarily find itself reflected in the actual music, White Denim's material more than reflects the speed with which it was released. It's only fitting one of their earlier full-lengths was titled Fits. It's not just that the band itself often seems eager to stuff as many notes as possible into every moment of every song, but that the songs themselves are filled to the brim with tempo shifts and nods to different kinds of music-- and all these ideas that just seem to pour out of the band. Even as the group's brand of psychedelica has grown from its garagey roots into something more expansive and jammy, that frenetic energy hasn't ebbed. For the most part, White Denim succeed with this full-steam-ahead tack, though the generosity of creative spirit (and the high-speed fashion in which said spirit is imparted onto the listener) might seem exhausting as often as it does exhilarating. What makes Takes Place in Your Work Space a welcome addition to the burgeoning White Denim discography is its road-not-taken approach. This EP might be the most relaxed the band has ever been on record. Of course, I am talking in terms of the group, not what most folks consider ""relaxed."" When ""Cat City"" starts up, the guitar and drums kick into high gear as if it's business as usual. Despite how that may sound, the song itself is sedate, thanks in no small part to subtle, backward guitar loops and James Petralli's easygoing vocals. Elsewhere on the EP, the band uses similar tactics and arrangements to take the edge off. On ""Handwriting"", the contrast to the main group's hustle is provided by a string section, some nicely pitched background vocals, and a little pedal steel. For ""Company"", it's Petralli's falsetto (at times sounding a lot like Andrew Bird's) that does the job, though nicking the gait and melody from Love's ""Alone Again Or"" doesn't hurt. The EP's best track, ""No Real Reason"", is similarly beholden to its possible source material-- LCD Soundsystem fans might hear more than a passing resemblance to ""Never as Tired...""-- but White Denim's homage (inadvertent or otherwise) is wholly successful, showing the group can slow its roll without losing its sense of direction or purpose. More heartening than that minor revelation is the EP's overall cohesion. Being only four tracks long goes a long way toward maintaining a release's integrity and focus, but unlike other White Denim albums-- which contain some great-sounding, highly dissimilar tracks that just happen to be sharing the same space-- the songs on Takes Place complement each other and sound like they belong together. If there's been any tool missing from White Denim's warehouse-sized arsenal, it's this sort of ability to mete their boundless creativity with a sense of consistency and cohesion.","What makes this four-song EP a welcome addition to the White Denim discography is its road-not-taken approach. It might also be the most relaxed the band's ever sounded on record.

Impossible Spaces,Sandro Perri,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19eea9e61561daa67d6/1:1/w_160/d1e05c22.jpeg,2011-10-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15940-sandro-perri/,Constellation,"Sandro Perri has never shied away from expressing his admiration for Arthur Russell; among the highlights of the Toronto musician/producer's decade-plus-long career was a distended, 21-minute reinterpretation of Russell's already lengthy Dinosaur disco classic ""Kiss Me Again"". But as Perri's discography has pluralized and diversified in unexpected ways, Russell has become less of a direct musical influence than an inspirational model of following one's muse across dance, avant-garde, and roots-rock boundaries, and marking those stylistic shifts with different, highly evocative aliases. Since first establishing himself in the early 2000s as a producer of aquatic, cerebral techno under the Polmo Polpo moniker, Perri has variously indulged his interest in Nigerian juju and shantytown funk with one-album wonders Glissandro 70 and dubby disco as Dot Wiggin. But since 2007, he's been releasing albums under his own name, signaling a singer-songwriterly shift that foregrounds Perri's considerable talents as a pedal-steel guitarist and fondness for 1970s AM-radio pop, even going so far as to faithfully cover Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" and Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin'"". Scanning the tracklist on Perri's new album, Impossible Spaces, you're first greeted with another familiar title: ""Changes"". But while the song that bears its name turns out not to be a version of either the David Bowie classic or the Black Sabbath piano ballad, Perri at the very least embraces the root sentiment behind that well-worn title. Though ""Changes"" picks up where 2007's tropically tranquil Tiny Mirrors left off, there are some immediately noticeable developments: Perri's plainspoken voice is several inches higher in the mix, and the sound has been thickened considerably by warm organ tones and more scabrous electric-guitar lines, while drummer Dan Gaucher sounds like he's itching to kick into a more robust backbeat. But then after three and a half minutes of stop-start teases, ""Changes"" does just that, by shifting into a glorious instrumental coda-- powered by a chugging Afro-funk groove and analog-synth starbursts-- that feels like an ecstatic, out-of-body-experience answer to the more tentative passage that preceded it. ""Changes"" effectively confirms Impossible Spaces as the first Sandro Perri release to truly synthesize his myriad musical interests and place equal emphasis on rhythm, texture, and melody. With Perri backed once again by a coterie of Toronto improv-scene all stars-- who provide him with all the queasy-listening sophistication of a more inebriated Sea and Cake or a less spastic Dirty Projectors-- the album strikes an uncanny balance between sounding ambitiously executed and completely off-the-cuff; an epic of both accident and design. Perri isn't afraid to push his song lengths past the seven-minute mark (or thematically link shorter tracks into two-part suites), but Impossible Spaces never feels taxing or overwrought. Rather, extended and exceedingly patient pieces like the woodwind-powered ""How Will I?"" and the exquisite 10-minute beast ""Wolfman"" yield a sustained thrill of discovery as, with each new verse, they wind and wander into an ever-dislocating swirl of brass, flutes, electric guitar, strings, and synth drones. Throughout it all, Perri's invariably calm tenor assumes the reassuring presence of a tour guide who won't tell you where you're going but ensures you pass through safely: He rarely sings his verse melodies in any kind of formalized cadence but always returns to a familiar chorus refrain at just the right time to help you get reoriented. In that sense, Impossible Spaces isn't simply the most accessible and immediately rewarding album to bear Sandro Perri's name, it also serves as a handy musical roadmap to its maker's sinuous creative course.","For the past decade, Sandro Perri has followed his muse across dance, avant-garde, and roots-rock boundaries. The Toronto musician/producer's new album is his first to truly synthesize these musical interests.

Laughing Stock / Mark Hollis,Talk TalkMark Hollis,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b05e6ef9596932218a/1:1/w_160/cf97e4ec.jpeg,2011-10-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15957-laughing-stock-mark-hollis/,Ba Da Bing,"There are many ways for a band to follow up a hit. None of them is guaranteed to work, but some are more likely than others to flop, artistically or otherwise. This reissue of Talk Talk's final album, 1991's Laughing Stock, presented here without any distracting ""bonuses"" on immaculate vinyl, helps tells the story of Talk Talk's fraught, exhausting, confounding, brave, and ultimately brilliant final act. (There's also a postscript, in the form of frontman Mark Hollis' solo album, but we'll get to that.) Though you're more likely to describe Laughing Stock as lovely or otherworldly or even gentle, in its way it's as uncompromising as any apocalyptic noise record. And in a weird way it exists only because Talk Talk were at one time a hit-making pop band. Formed in 1981, by 1986 Talk Talk were enjoying the biggest sales and best reviews of their short career, thanks to their third album, The Colour of Spring. Having started out as a moodier-than-average synth-pop act-- Duran Duran with the glitz and hedonism swapped out for nervous jitters and existential dread-- they'd transformed into the avant-garde edge of 1980s M.O.R. Even at their most acceptance-hungry, there'd always been something faintly left-of-center about Talk Talk, from Mark Hollis' haunted and word-swallowing singing to the musical hints that the band was more interested in 1970s prog than 80s dance-rock. On The Colour of Spring, the big, romantic ballads were still there, but they were strangely muted. They had an eerie jazz-like minimalism and attention to atmosphere that suggested an appreciation for Eno's ambient records. This canny mix, stadium-friendly melodrama in an experimental but not too out-there package, paid greater commercial dividends than probably anyone would have guessed. With EMI's accounting department more than pleased, the label gave Talk Talk carte blanche to make any damned album they wished. The result was the band's fourth album, 1988's Spirit of Eden. Talk Talk took up this new freedom with a perverse relish, racking up countless hours and major dollars recording Spirit, a gorgeous but amorphous epic that proved that ruthless quiet could be just as difficult as ear-harassing volume. Talk Talk took this go-ahead from their label as their chance, possibly their last, to explore their truly envelope-pushing ideas, rather than the hints they'd offered on Spring. By the time of Spirit, Talk Talk had fully rejected the sleek and kitschily futuristic music that first brought then to prominence. In its place, they crafted an immersive and ever-flowing style, alternately hushed and loud, lush and arid. It was a brand of unashamed art rock that was completely out of step with both the underground's unkempt roar and the manicured mainstream. Jazz became a more major component than ever, both in the overall style of playing, especially drummer Lee Harris' steady and cymbal-heavy swing, but also in the band's increasingly complex and usually improvised interaction. These improvisations were stitched together after the fact into what sound like carefully thought-out compositions that still somehow vibrate with the surprise of in-the-moment exploration. Which partly explains how ""I Believe in You"", Hollis' most comprehensible performance on an album where a lyric sheet is very necessary, can feel like a singer-songwriter ballad floating in and out of a swirl that evokes avant-classical at its least forbidding and electric jazz at its most beatific. This genre-blurring fearlessness, along with the way Spirit and Laughing Stock bloom from extreme quiet to extreme loudness only to slowly recede again, is why these albums get tagged as precursors to post-rock, when no post-rock albums much resemble them in sound, construction, or especially ambition. Talk Talk use ideas from jazz and classical to build the subtlest gradations of drama. But despite the restraint, it's also not polite, musically or otherwise. Hands were wrung on a corporate level over Spirit. Some old fans understandably balked, though new fans did gradually accumulate. An note of puzzlement could be read in the press notices, whether they offered praise or derision. The band decamped to Polydor and made an even more opaque fifth and final album, using much the same methodology as on Spirit and seeming to give even less of a shit about how it would all be received. This is the oft-repeated and probably too-pat story that gave Talk Talk a second life as fame-spurning and journey-hardened underground icons. But it's also not hard to understand why the band broke up after Laughing Stock, or was simply broken. There's more going on in these six tracks than on Spirit, but the song structures are even stranger, built up from the tiniest musical gestures, clashing in mood from track to track, frequently more improvised-sounding than ever. The goal, assembling a coherent album from all this stuff, probably seemed quixotic to many of the contributors as it was being made. The recording process has long been described as one of the most arduous and prone to control freakitude ever. The band members were probably relieved to dissolve Talk Talk, move on to less demanding projects, or recede back into private life, once Laughing Stock was finished, despite the monumentality of what they finally made. And it remains wholly singular, however many indie rock bands and experimental composers have genuflected toward it over the last 20 years. The half-dozen songs on Laughing Stock feel discrete, complete-unto-themselves, each one a little world that doesn't always seem to have much to do with the song that precedes or follows it. The underwater glide of ""New Grass"" is Talk Talk as a purely placid and lovely proposition, electric organ and lilting guitar endlessly circling around Harris' heartbeat-steady drumming, recalling the tranquility threatened with an edge of disquiet in Robert Wyatt's early solo work. ""Ascension Day"" remains the band's most chaotic and vicious song, like a small jazz combo being elbowed aside by a noise-rock band, with a climactic barrage of drumming that falls on your ears like an avalanche before the audible tape-splice cuts it dead. But even in this assault you can hear the monomaniacal care and craft that went into assembling and recording Laughing Stock, from the full-bodied throb of the upright bass to the little twitches and groans of horror-movie music lurking in the background on the verses. Laughing Stock was Talk Talk at their most demanding, and when listening to the spectral free jazz squeal of ""Taphead"", you understand why it was saddled for so many years with the ""difficult"" epithet. The Laughing Stock reissue sounds amazing, as good as the album's ever sounded, in any format. Which is crucial, because on some level Talk Talk's later albums are all about sound. How startling, isolated moments of sound, or a formless wash of sound, can wring emotions out of listeners as powerfully as any conventional melody. How the ambient sound of the room in which an album was recorded can be used almost as instrument in itself, and how the studio can be used to create a sense of environment in the listener's mind that has nothing to do with recording booths and control decks. How far the sound of a rock song can be pared back and loosened up and still be ""rock,"" or even still be ""a song."" And especially how sound can become all the more powerful when surrounded by silence, great gulfs of which are all over the later Talk Talk albums, especially Laughing Stock, captured here in a remarkable vinyl mastering job on Ba Da Bing's part. Seven years after Laughing Stock, and seven years into the band's slow word-of-mouth rehabilitation from pretentious flop to shining example for independent artists, Mark Hollis returned with a completely unexpected solo album, which seemed to almost sneak out into the real world rather than be ""released"" with the usual promotional fanfare. Part of this feeling comes from Hollis' almost Salinger-grade rejection of celebrity, journalism, the industry, even making art for public consumption. (Talk Talk virtually disappeared as a public entity from Spirit onward, leaving the records to do most of the talking.) But it also comes from the startlingly private sound of Mark Hollis itself, like the kind of painful, personal document that's usually released only after the artist's death. Where Laughing Stock creates multiple environments, Mark Hollis is intimate, almost shockingly so. Hollis often sings as if he's right up against your ear, at a volume designed to not wake spouses and small children. Listening, you often feel like you're eavesdropping on a musician working in the supposed seclusion of his home. Indeed, like few other records I know-- maybe Panda Bear's Young Prayer and Arthur Russell's World of Echo-- Mark Hollis creates the sensation that you're very much in the room where it was recorded. But where those albums sounded very much like thrifty, one-man-band operations, Mark Hollis draws on a cast of musicians almost as large as Laughing Stock, and in their own self-consciously restricted way, these songs are as dramatic as anything on that album. Certainly they're as immersive, if only because you have to listen so closely, thanks to the lower-than-low-volume approach to recording and playing, in order to follow the even more classical-informed logic of their movement, whole songs carried by just an oblique dance of woodwinds or a long-decaying string melody. Over its eight minutes, ""A Life (1895-1915)"" plays like a novel whittled down to a haiku, tracing one WWI soldier's tragic arc from birth to early death on the battlefield, with Hollis' barely audible voice at the song's end communicating as much ache as any of his more full-throated performances. If the hermetic Laughing Stock was a scaling back of the wide-open grandeur of Spirit of Eden, then Mark Hollis is an even more radical reduction of scale. So it's no surprise that Hollis has been publicly silent ever since, since silence always seems to be where the songs on Mark Hollis want to go, as if it took great effort to even decide to commit these particular sounds to tape. Perhaps Hollis just feels that he's said everything he had to say. Or perhaps he's still deliberating as to what, if anything, he's comfortable with releasing next. Unlike many reclusive musicians, though, you won't feel that Hollis absented himself before his overall project was completed. These albums still stand a good chance of alienating you, but if you find yourself vibrating sympathetically to them, there's enough mystery and beauty in them to sustain a lifetime's listening, whether Hollis or Talk Talk ever record another note.","These magnificent reissues of English art-rock innovators Talk Talk's 1991 final record Laughing Stock and their reclusive leader Mark Hollis' 1998 self-titled solo album are presented on immaculate vinyl.

Harbored Mantras,Water Borders,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a1b1335d7bf169a2eb/1:1/w_160/2ab742d4.jpeg,2011-10-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15938-harbored-mantras/,Tri Angle,"For a debut, Harbored Mantras is impressively consistent. Water Borders, the San Francisco-based duo of Amitai Heller and Loric Sih, have clearly put lots of thought and effort into honing their sound-- a dark, gothic mix of shadowy synths, dogmatic beats, and disembodied vocals. Their ghostly style touches on the industrial haunts of Coil as well as the mysterious vibes of various dance and techno sub-genres. It's not a wide range of reference points, but the limited palate helps give Water Borders focus. There are none of the random misfires or gratuitous left turns here that can mar debut albums. Where Harbored Mantras does sound like a first try is in its lack of surprise. Water Borders haven't yet figured out how to insert substantial variety into such a well-defined sound. As the album progresses, consistency becomes a straitjacket. The duo seems so unwilling to break its own rules that it rarely bends them. This is most apparent in the vocals, which can be evocatively chilly, but often sound generic-- like a diluted Peter Murphy or Andrew Eldritch-- and more concerned with matching the music than adding something unique to it. The result is that you've heard everything Water Borders do long before Harbored Mantras is over. Still, every track has something interesting to offer. At their best, like on the rattling ""Bad Ethos"", simple repetition becomes hypnotic mantra, evoking the stunning séances of Forest Swords. The duo builds deep layers of mood, giving Harbored Mantras the feel of an infinite cave, which can be both absorbing and suffocating. But they fare best when their air-shaking beats thrust through those layers. Take the Gang Gang Dance-like ritual ""Feasting on Mongeese"", or the spooky tribalism of ""Antechamber"", which sounds like the Residents doing techno. In both cases, rhythm proves to be an eminently sturdy spine. Perhaps that's what will ultimately allow Water Borders to stretch their sound: Their beats are solid and captivating enough that they should be able to expand sonically without surrendering their stable core.","On their debut LP, San Francisco's Water Borders create a dark, gothic mix of shadowy synths, dogmatic beats, and disembodied vocals, touching on the industrial haunts of Coil and the mysterious vibes of various dance and techno sub-genres.

Twerps,Twerps,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1afc0084474cd0c1e57/1:1/w_160/93bba42a.jpeg,2011-10-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15951-twerps-twerps/,Underwater PeoplesChapter Music,"When Twerps got together in 2008, they've said they wanted to write a song like the Clean's ""Anything Could Happen"". The Melbourne band did just that, and on their 2009 self-titled EP, the influence of the Clean and other Flying Nun artists could be heard in the paced-but-driving riffs of songs like ""Little Guys"". Unfortunately, the EP wasn't very cohesive-- it sounded like a group of people tinkering with different ideas and sounds without fully settling on an aesthetic. There were ballads, but also a lo-fi tune where the vocal sounded like a Dead Milkmen-style monologue. On their self-titled full-length debut, they keep the Flying Nun influence, ramp up the jangle in their guitar sound, and find their voice. ""Voice"" can be a nebulous term for four people, but the the band definitely has a unified point of view here. Musically, Twerps features several breezy, reverb-laced riffs, most of which could earn them an easy comparison to Real Estate-- although the influence, again, likely comes from their Australia- and New Zealand-based forebears. There are also some assertive riffs, like the driving surf rock solo of ""Dreamin'"" or the urgent, distortion-heavy refrain of ""Don't Be Surprised"".  And, on ""Who Are You"", a paced, inebriated sing-along, the band's joined by members of their Australian rock community, folks from Eddy Current Suppression Ring, Beaches, and Panel of Judges all slurring a looped ""We'll get drunk/ we'll get stoned/ We'll get high/ We'll get..."" They're tightest thematically: Every song follows a related narrative of young, conflicted love. Several times they present a melodramatic statement-- for instance, ""This Guy""'s ""If you want me to/ I'll die for you""-- but sing the line with a straight-faced, unswerving delivery. Toward the end of the album, guitarist/vocalist Marty Frawley's voice becomes quiet and fragile. On ""Bring Me Down"", it's weary and deep as he quietly delivers a few vignettes of heartbreak behind an acoustic strum. He doesn't get into specifics or talk much about his feelings-- he just walks around the block to clear his head, and, after some thought, hastily decides to skip town. In the middle of the album, there's the five-minute ""Jam Song"". For the most part, it's exactly that-- a song where they jam for a while with some loose vocals attached. But in fact, Frawley's slurring is another illustration of overbearing desperation: ""I wanna live inside your soul,"" he shouts. These are all good examples of what they do so well on Twerps: excellent melodies, simple guitar lines, and simple lyrics that imply something urgent or devastating. As they've said in interviews, they've done some growing up for this album, and you can hear it, mostly in the tone of their instruments. They make those bold, doe-eyed statements, then offset them by a tinge of melancholy in their guitars, implying something more self-aware and devastating.","After a mixed-bag EP, Twerps' self-titled debut finds the breezy Melbourne pop quartet ramping up the jangle of its Flying Nun-influenced sound and finding its voice in a series of songs about young, conflicted love.

Creatures of an Hour,Still Corners,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15d9d034d5c69bf49eb/1:1/w_160/f9fa53b1.jpeg,2011-10-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15894-still-corners-creatures-of-an-hour/,Sub Pop,"When Tessa Murray sings ""Stuck in a time machine/ That was just a dream,"" on ""Cuckoo"", the lead-off track from Still Corners' Creatures of an Hour, she sums up much of the dreamy, 1960s-obsessed band's most obvious attributes. London-based Still Corners are something of a transatlantic hybrid: American Greg Hughes began the band when he met Murray in London, and they grew to a quartet shortly afterwards. There was a long spell between their debut EP Remember Pepper? and last year's sweetly jangly single ""Don't Fall in Love"", but their first full-length, Creatures of an Hour, is a cohesive statement of the band's aesthetic-- nouvelle-vague-nodding retro-cool. Fashioning the most familiar signifiers of 60s style in a contemporary frame, Creatures of an Hour is a perfect soundtrack for the internet's vast acreage of Anna Karina Tumblrs. Which makes a certain kind of sense: Still Corners like movies. They talk in interviews about the inspiration they draw from their favorite kinds of films (Italian horror, French New Wave, and anything soundtracked by Ennio Morricone), and their music often gets tagged with that puzzlingly synesthesiac adjective ""cinematic."" It calls to mind the way earlier this year the internet was buzzing with talk about Dirty Beaches' Badlands, a record that drew more comparisons to like-minded filmmakers (David Lynch, Wong Kar Wai) than musicians. It seemed to signal something about the way we listen to music now-- the importance of the audio-visual experience in making aesthetic connections in a digital music scene flooded with new artists. Still Corners' most prominent touchstone, though, is a band that, even a decade ago, sounded like they were making soundtracks to imaginary French New Wave classics. The influence of Broadcast is evident all over Creatures of an Hour, from the eerie carnival synths of ""Circulars"" to the chilly, music-box plink of ""The White Season"". It's perhaps unfair to hold a band's first record up to the high-water mark of their idols-- and especially brutal since most of us are still reeling from singer Trish Keenan's untimely passing. But since they draw overtly from Broadcast's overall aesthetic, Murray's vocals cannot but fall flat under the inevitable comparison the rest of their sound evokes. She sings each track in a breathy exhale like she's trying to fog up a car window. All of which sounds lovely, but there's not enough substance or personality in the vocals she displays on these tracks to transcend her influences-- or to be very memorable at all. Creatures of an Hour is top-heavy: the early-sequenced ""Cuckoo"" and ""Endless Summer"" are the record's incontestable highlights. The rest of the music lacks specificity: No particular melodies, images, or moods really stick out from the vast, dreamy atmosphere that washes over you while you're listening. Creatures is a nice dream-- certainly not an unpleasant place to be. But its resounding vagueness becomes apparent once you wake: It's not exactly going to make for a rip-roaring entry in your dream journal or anything.","Fashioning the most familiar signifiers of 1960s style in a contemporary frame, dreamy London-based quartet Still Corner's full-length debut is a cohesive statement of the band's nouvelle-vague-nodding retro-cool.

Rapprocher,Class Actress,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19cea9e61561daa67d1/1:1/w_160/3d3d1e68.jpeg,2011-10-20 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15941-rapprocher/,Carpark,"The musical past of Elizabeth Harper, the frontwoman for Brooklyn electronic pop outfit Class Actress, is fairly well-documented-- it's something even the band doesn't attempt to hide. And yet, with the arrival of Class Actress's debut full-length, Rapprocher, that past seems worth pointing out again, if only to illustrate the drastic turn her career's taken over the past eight or so years. In 2004, years before Class Actress came into existence, Harper released a self-titled solo album of singer/songwriter-y material with no spangly synths. Even if what she was doing then wasn't terribly compelling, you get the impression she valued substance over style. Skip to five years later when Harper linked up with producer Mark Richardson (no relation to Pitchfork's editor-in-chief) and engineer/multi-instrumentalist Scott Rosenthal for Class Actress' debut EP, Journal of Ardency, and you can almost hear her sonically relocating from open-mic night culture to cool, cosmopolitan glam-- in other words, from one part of Manhattan to, well, another part of Manhattan. (Even if they do call themselves a Brooklyn band, the truth is that Class Actress have never sounded like they're from Brooklyn.) The cover of Rapprocher brings that transformation full circle: witness Harper, lying on white sheets, mugging seductively for the camera with something awfully sparkly hiding behind her ear. It's a glamorous image, and besides being incredibly reminiscent of the cover art for Bryan Ferry's solo album from last year, Olympia, it's an excellent representation of how Rapprocher sounds-- that is, luxurious and picture-perfect in presentation. The somewhat shy intimacy that marked Journal of Ardency is more or less gone, replaced by bright, layered production. (If Richardson and Rosenthal ever decide to ditch the band thing to become for-hire studio rats, they'll have little trouble finding work.) The synth work on Rapprocher is particularly impressive, maintaining a tangy sharpness while a pop sweetness flows from every corner. Eschewing any notions of ""indie"" that come with releasing a record on the increasingly faddish Carpark label, Rapprocher is a capital-P pop album, and a pretty good one at that. Despite the band's cited influences (Depeche Mode, the first few Madonna albums), a fair amount of this record sounds rooted in the more out-there sounds of contemporary pop. (If you're skeptical, listen to ""Prove Me Wrong"" back to back with Ludacris' ""Splash Waterfalls"".) There's little doubt that Class Actress are ambitious for success beyond opening tour slots; even the lyrical content, which is super-generalized and occasionally empty of meaning, suggest a yearning for mainstream achievement outside the five boroughs. Honestly, I'm not sure this album is their ticket to that party. Don't get me wrong, they sound plenty accessible here, and it's only a matter of time before early singles ""Keep You"" and ""Weekend"" find placement on a TV show on the CW. Considering the populist roots of their sound, though, Class Actress still sound a little too weird to truly break through (and if they toned that weirdness down, this record just wouldn't be as interesting). Another barrier holding Rapprocher from being a complete success is Elizabeth Harper's voice, a voice that worked well amidst the low-key surroundings on Journal of Ardency but often falters here. The issue at hand: there are more than a few songs (""Keep You"" and ""Love Me Like You Used To"" being the most egregious offenders) with choruses that call for world-beating, chest-thumping delivery. Harper doesn't have the strength for that, so every time she tries to tackle those, it fizzles like a wet bottle rocket. She fares much better on the album's closing track, ""Let Me In"", an electro-bliss freefall that takes Rapprocher out on a slo-mo rocket of beauty. Otherwise, she still sounds like she's struggling to find what fits her best-- she's come this far, though, so be patient.","The Elizabeth Harper-fronted Brooklyn electronic pop outfit's full-length debut replaces the shy intimacy of the band's earlier work with bright, layered production and a luxurious, picture-perfect presentation.

Life Is Full of Possibilities,Dntel,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ad5e6ef95969322182/1:1/w_160/b2937f63.jpeg,2011-10-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15950-dntel-life-is-full-of-possibilities/,Sub Pop,"Ten years ago, this sounded like the future. The combination of pop songcraft and electronic texture that Jimmy Tamborello conjured on Dntel's Life Is Full of Possibilities seemed to achieve one of the implicit cardinal goals of independent music: to strike a seamless balance between ""catchy"" and ""experimental."" It was a coup for those of us who had both Squarepusher and Promise Ring discs in our CD changers, a promise that the exhilarating high-budget sonics of Radiohead's Kid A could be brought down to the more human scale of bedroom indie pop. In a certain, ineffable way it just sounded right for its time, much in the way that Dirty Projectors' Bitte Orca and tUnE-yArDs' w h o k i l l have in recent years. In the decade since Life Is Full of Possibilities was first released on the Plug Research label, we've realigned our perceptions of both ""catchy"" and ""experimental."" The sweet, straightforward melodies on Life Is Full of Possibilities now seem almost embarrassingly earnest, the electronic manipulations cold and procedural. While Tamborello's mastery is undeniable, there's a staggering sense of openness to Life Is Full of Possibilities in both its content and its execution. There is no mystery here; you can see the gears turning, both emotionally and sonically. For all its skittery beats and overdriven synthesizers, Life Is Full of Possibilities often feels less like an ""intelligent dance music"" record than a straight-up 1990s emo record, with the muscle of a traditional rock band proxied by Tamborello's smart, dynamic arrangements. Though Tamborello's instrumentals are the only constant on an album studded with guest vocalists, Life Is Full of Possibilities feels more like the product of a disciplined, rotating collective than a solo album with one-off collaborators. Each song is particularly well-suited to its respective singer, and each singer fully engages with Tamborello's instrumental tracks. An air of melancholy hangs over most of this album, but Tamborello understands that Mia Doi Todd's flat, confident vocals on ""Anywhere Anyone"" evoke a very different kind of melancholy from Beachwood Sparks singer Chris Gunst's fragile, unsteady vocals on ""Umbrella"". Tamborello foregos a more manipulated vocal treatment and lets a tuneful vocal from Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard anchor the swirling, overdriven ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"", setting the stage for the bajillion-selling full-length collaboration the two would release as the Postal Service. (Music theory geek aside: there's a certain magic to Gibbard's voice when he sings a perfect fifth up followed by a minor third down, as he does in nearly all of his best songs.) Four remixes of ""Evan and Chan"" are far and away the drabbest bonus material on Sub Pop's deluxe reissue; removed from the original song's arc, the individual sonic elements here just aren't that interesting. An alternate version of ""Umbrella"" shows what a more half-assed version of this album might have sounded like, with Chris Gunst's voice locked into a repetitive pattern and bolstered by obvious, heavy-handed swells of distortion. ""Evan and Chan"" B-side ""Your Hill"" is the strongest non-album cut here, culling its primary melody from a loud monophonic synthesizer while using vocals as abstract, poetic ornamentation. Broadly speaking, the bonus material here veers more toward the conventional IDM of its time, falling short of the original album but also making a case for its unique strengths. The best thing about this reissue has nothing to do with its bonus material, though; a solid remastering job pushes both treble and the bass beyond the relatively thin, high-mid-leaning sonic footprint of many late-90s and early-00s computer-recorded albums. Digital conversion technology, much like music itself, has changed a lot in the last 10 years-- which seems like a fairly short time between release and reissue, but also a really long time to have passed since this particular album came out. For a record fixated on personal nostalgia, Life Is Full of Possibilities still feels bright-eyed and forward-thinking. That Tamborello's ambition and optimism now seem slightly distant and idealistic probably says more about us now than it does about this album. This may not be the future we chose, but it remains a beautiful future to imagine.","Now reissued with bonus material, this album is now best rememberd for birthing the Postal Service, via the Jimmy Tamborello and Ben Gibbard collaboration ""The Dream of Evan and Chan"". A decade on, it offers a vision of how ""experimental"" met ""catchy"" in 2001.

Trust Now,Prince Rama,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b195b1335d7bf169a2d5/1:1/w_160/a3013b8e.jpeg,2011-10-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15933-trust-now/,Paw Tracks,"When Pitchfork's Joe Colly reviewed Prince Rama's fourth album, Shadow Temple, he signed off by hinting that the band's psych experiments ""might become something more"" in the future. A little over a year later, Trust Now has arrived, again on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks imprint, to test out that prognosis. A few things have changed in the intervening months-- they've slimmed down to a duo of sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson after their fellow founding member Michael Collins went on hiatus from the group, and Scott Colburn (Sun City Girls, Arcade Fire) replaced Avey Tare and Deakin in the producers' chair. There's been a minor toughening up of the sound, with everything from the swampy keyboard work to the wailed vocal lines gaining a little more bite, but otherwise Trust Now continues in the same vein as its predecessor. For a band reportedly raised on a Hare Krishna farm and with a live show that positively reeks of patchouli oil, there's a surprising amount of bad vibes sunk into Prince Rama's music. They may give their songs titles like ""Golden Silence"" and ""Summer of Love"", but the repetitive stretches of tribal drumming and vocal incantations makes them sound like they're trying to cook up the accompaniment to a horrific Wicker Man-style ritual. The problem is one of identity; the music doesn't swing far enough in a full-on occult direction to give a true sense of nastiness, nor does it completely bask in the hippy idealism the Larson sisters are clearly so well versed in. It's a touch too polite and apologetic, more Sabrina, the Teenage Witch than Witchfinder General. ""Trust"" is the best demonstration of the dichotomy at the heart of the band. It begins with a vocal line that intones the title of the song over and over, like we're being ushered into the most genial ritual sacrifice of all time, while squealing synth tones wail in the background. Midway through the song, it's turned into much lighter fare, with a keyboard motif that could have been ripped straight from Haha Sound-era Broadcast, which picks out a poppy melody that feels at odds with the first half of the track. In fact, Prince Rama could learn something by listening to Broadcast and the Focus Group's collaborative album, Investigate W**itch Cults of the Radio Age, which contains the creepy air of inventiveness that Trust Now is striving for but can't ever reach. The music here contains germs of good ideas, but too often they get frittered away through loose and indulgent jams that never go anywhere. On those Broadcast/Focus Group recordings, the musicians appeared to be immersed in the kind of folkloric tales that provide the unpleasant edge material like this needs. It's also got the kind of razor-sharp sense of purpose from which Trust Now could benefit. Instead Prince Rama end up mired somewhere closer to kitsch, especially when their music meanders without much purpose on songs like ""Portaling"" or uses a corny ""boing"" sound (presumably made by a mouth harp, or a sample of one) on ""Incarnation"". Frustratingly, Trust Now doesn't advance on the better ideas from Shadow Temple, particularly the elements of dance music that occasionally surfaced. Essentially it's the core Prince Rama sound boiled down to its essence, which means anyone hoping for this band to ""become something more"" should sit this one out and hope the Larsons can finely trim their vision next time.","Boiled down to sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson and featuring producer Scott Colburn instead of Animal Collective's Avey Tare and Deakin, Prince Rama's fifth album finds the Brooklyn experimental psych duo continuing in the same vein as 2010's Shadow Temple.

Gauntlet Hair,Gauntlet Hair,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b154b1335d7bf169a26a/1:1/w_160/c4c996c3.jpeg,2011-10-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15884-gauntlet-hair/,Dead Oceans,"Artsy, reverb-damaged experimental poppers with negligible lyrics aren't exactly rare these days. Whether chillwave or lo-fi, post-dubstep or just plain unclassifiable, many of our decade's most intriguing young voices are often less than wholly articulate. Even when you can make out the lyrics, as Pitchfork's Brian Howe observed recently, they're often cryptic or generic-- both in big-tent indie rock and on the U.S. pop charts. Take Gauntlet Hair. They're not even alone in their own adopted Mile High City. Denver's nonprofit D.I.Y. art space Rhinoceropolis has also midwifed instrumental electro-rockers Tjutjuna, formerly instrumental electro-rockers Woodsman, and punk-scorched electro-house producer Pictureplane. But the duo of Andy R. (né Andy Rauworth) and drummer Craig Nice (né Craig Fleischman) don't only hang out in the world of ""avant"" prefixes. Their stirring 2010 single, ""I Was Thinking..."", aired during an ESPN special on quarterback Tim Tebow. And Craig, who also uses electronic drum triggers, has cited Beyoncé as an influence on his beats. Gauntlet Hair's self-titled debut is the most compelling demonstration yet of the band's knack for headphones-friendly fist-pumpers. Andy and Craig say they've been playing together since they were 15-- almost a decade ago-- and their songs are stacked with enough ideas to back that up. Andy, who lists the Durutti Column's impeccably fluid guitarist Vini Reilly as an inspiration, uses lots of delay, chorus, and echo effects on his springy guitar licks, giving them a refracted, percussive quality while also making them sound larger than life. When Craig drops those Timbaland-style beats next to his cymbal crashes, you almost wonder whether these guys pal around with Colorado's own, chart-topping OneRepublic. But then you remember Gauntlet Hair are originally from Illinois, where they recorded this album-- at Andy's grandmother's house. Andy and Craig trade off vocals, which evokes comparisons to likeminded duos: the more cerebral No Age, the more visceral Japandroids. Except Gauntlet Hair sing in half-decipherable yawps, lofted, in celebration or in heartache, over neatly constructed, shape-shifting songs-- when words fail, the feelings still resonate. The longest track here, ""Lights Out"", plays like a fun-house guitar version of a hugely dramatic Tears for Fears song for three minutes, then swerves into a massive two-minute outro, adding and subtracting just enough catchy bits to maintain the emotional affect. No, ""I Was Thinking..."" isn't here, and second A-side ""Out, Don't..."" isn't, either. As a result, yes, Gauntlet Hair lasts only nine songs. But they're all potential singles in their own right, all different: the romantic smolder of ""Showing"", the jittery throb of ""Mop It Up"" (the one that goes, ""You say goodbye""), the sparkly shuffle of ""Overkill"" (something about ""praying"" and a ""vision""). On closing track ""Shout in Tongues"", the drums drop out to expose a repeated shout that brings to mind the most famous song by the godfathers of the current decade's artsy, reverb-damaged experimental poppers, Animal Collective. ""I want a child that breaks the rules, goes to school, and""-- I'm not sure what comes next. Adobe slats? Better listen again.","This Denver experimental pop duo's self-titled debut is a compelling demonstration of their knack for headphones-friendly fist-pumpers.

All Things Will Unwind,My Brightest Diamond,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a2ea9e61561daa67da/1:1/w_160/7df297ea.jpeg,2011-10-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15942-all-things-will-unwind/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Shara Worden's output as My Brightest Diamond is largely unclassifiable, a designation that's favorable in theory but can also be deeply stunting. For years, Worden has drifted between genres and tones (assimilating bits of the opera, classical, indie rock, folk, and experimental canons), letting her vocals act as the lone narrative thread and defining principle. These songs were hers because she was the only person who could sing them, and that felt like enough. Still, while confining artists to a single sound or style might be a philistine's errand, it also gives listeners something recognizable to cling to; there are no bits of boat floating in the water here, and her third LP, All Things Will Unwind, both suffers and succeeds in relation to its scope. Already well known for her collaborations with chamber-oriented musicians (Sufjan Stevens, the National), Worden is now backed by the contemporary ensemble yMusic, who add plenty of playful bits to her oft-ethereal, shifting folk songs. Strummed opener ""We Added It Up"" is punctuated by various strings and toots; it unfolds like a Rube Goldberg contraption, all call and response. Worden sings about circumstantial incompatibility-- ""If I was love/ Then you were shhh""-- with convincing fervor, before the track transforms into a quasi-reassuring mantra. ""Love binds the world,"" Worden and her backing vocalists chant, but it's still hard to know (with good reason) whether those particular shackles are supposed to be a comfort or a curse.  It's a pleasantly hazy refrain; Worden's best moments come when she's at her darkest and most uncertain. The excellent ""Be Brave"" opens quietly, with muted drums and Worden's low growls: ""I'm feeling scared and I am overwhelmed,"" she sings. ""Be brave, dear one/ Be changed, be undone,"" she coaxes, and like ""We Added It Up"", the song proffers a tiny, passing glimpse of insecurity. Although Worden's vocal performances are varied and borderline virtuosic, it's easy to find yourself wishing for her voice to crack or crumple or fail, to be fallible in a way that's just as beautiful. The carefulness of All Things Will Unwind can feel impenetrable sometimes, and while her closest musical analogue is the equally ambitious Joanna Newsom, Worden lacks Newsom's oddball vulnerability-- it's the difference between performance and possession, and while there's certainly room for both, the former comes, always, with the risk of affectation. All Things Will Unwind's theatrical bent can read as goofy, if not wholly inscrutable (the slow-but-punchy ""There's a Rat"" feels cartoonish, while ""High Low Middle"" feels showy, staged). Mostly, though, Worden's drive-- to be so many things, to harness and perfect so many disparate sounds-- makes her work feel more distant than it should.","Known for collaborations with chamber-oriented musicians like Sufjan Stevens and the National, Shara Worden is backed by the contemporary ensemble yMusic on her third LP, a record that both suffers and succeeds in relation to its scope.

Tragedy,Julia Holter,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b193b1335d7bf169a2d1/1:1/w_160/f749b145.jpeg,2011-10-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15932-julia-holter/,Leaving,"It's almost unfortunate that Tragedy-- an album of distant, breathy voices; grainy sound collages; and heavy atmosphere with nearly no release-- came out now, in late 2011, if for no other reason that it sounds so contemporary. Younger bands making cool underground music have become goth-curious for the first time in probably 20 years, and the tendency to filter all ""pop"" hooks through the funhouses mirrors of ""avant-garde"" production techniques is so commonplace that clarity-- a voice spared from way too much reverb, for example-- has become the exception instead of the rule. Tragedy-- Julia Holter's first full-length-- is one of ""those records,"" but it's also more: more sonically detailed, more attentive to its compositions, and more clever and varied about its use of grayscale. Holter isn't just holding a Russian icon painting in the air and cranking the echo. In turn, it's a record with more integrity than a lot of its peers, a record committed to itself as a project but also exemplary as a summary of several trends in contemporary underground music now. If ""integrity"" sounds like an old-fashioned argument, well, it is. Holter's work here rhymes not only with artists as disparate as Zola Jesus and Grouper (or even a bad-dream version of Julianna Barwick), but with the quasi-classical, quasi-medieval sounds of 4AD bands circa the mid-1980s or a tradition of adventurous female artists like Laurie Anderson and Meredith Monk-- arty music that tends toward a kind of austere, asexual mystery. Holter uses plenty of synthesizers, but also field recordings and percussion that sounds like rattling chains, a blend of sounds that register as obviously ""unnatural"" and ones that register as almost tactile. Long passages of the record have no beats or vocals, and some of the more song-oriented tracks-- ""Try to Make Yourself a Work of Art"" or ""So Lillies"", for example-- are structured as ambient passages that seem like they're trying to organically slip into their ""pop"" moments, then slip out of them as the track comes to a close. The result is that Tragedy is a continuous experience that I've enjoyed best front-to-back instead of in parts-- a strength for when you have time and patience, a weakness when you don't. (And there's no ambiguity, I don't think, that Holter wants it that way: The first track is called ""Introduction"", the fifth is called ""Interlude"", and the last is called ""Tragedy Finale"".) I first heard Holter's music a few years ago, when a friend played me Monika Enterprise's 4 Women No Cry compilation, and her contributions there were more contained and mixtape-able-- it's a mode I think she can work in but chooses not to here. As a general rule, I try and avoid album concepts, especially when it gives the album weight it doesn't earn elsewhere. Tragedy, for example, is based on a 2,439-year-old Greek play by Euripedes-- just try and make it seem unimportant after that. Holter has made a dreamy, intense album that aligns with a variety of traditions but, like a lot of great contemporary music, synthesizes them in novel or at least artful ways. What gets me about it most, though, is its atmosphere and consistency: Sounds I can't identify resonate in the background; drones underpin entire songs without ever intruding. Still, I know Holter has made this possible, and that's what makes me trust her-- that's what makes me acknowledge the album's integrity. Results with other listeners may vary, but one of my favorite moments of Tragedy is listening to the murmuring, disjointed voices fade out in the album's last 30 seconds: That's when I realize how unified it is, hanging like a storm cloud that barely opens up.","Julia Holter's first LP-- an album of distant, breathy voices; grainy sound collages; and heavy atmosphere with nearly no release-- is a record committed to itself as a project, one that calls to mind the arty, austere work of Laurie Anderson, Grouper, and Meredith Monk.

Norman OST,Various Artists,by: Rachael Maddux,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19dea9e61561daa67d3/1:1/w_160/2fc3549c.jpeg,2011-10-19 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15943-norman-ost/,Mom + Pop,"It's been four years since Juno and seven since Garden State, which means we're due for another carefully soundtracked independent film celebrating young white folks' ability to find love despite crippling quirkiness. Right on schedule, here comes Norman, a 2010 festival-circuit selection rolling into theaters across the country with all the proper credentials: the square-peg protagonist (here, the titular Norman), the sweetly bumbling dalliance with an equally off-kilter would-be soulmate (Emily, ""a girl who likes Monty Python""), the heavy-hanging bleakness of some unfortunately timed personal tragedy (the death and illness of Norman's parents). Then, of course, there's the music, a soundtrack released a few weeks before the movie's super-limited national opening. But while the names on the tracklist read with the same indie-ish panache as those of Garden State and Juno, the two best-selling sophomore-year mix tapes in history, Norman takes a more focused approach. The film's score was composed and performed by Andrew Bird, a move that should shock no one faintly familiar with the classically trained multi-instrumentalist: Over the course of five solo albums, his swooping melodies and carefully built arrangements have all but pleaded to be overlaid on celluloid. Ten of his Norman tracks are original instrumental pieces that, even when taken out of their intended context (as we experienced them, unable to catch one of the movie's limited screenings before press time), fit nicely among his existing catalog. ""3:36"" is perhaps the most readily-identifiable as a Bird song, its nervous, gnawing waves pocked with violin pizzicato and eerie whistling, his dual touchstones that he's almost always better off ditching. Here, though, they're used sparingly, maximizing their effect. When the dreadful pulse that opens first track ""Scotch and Milk"" repeats three tracks later on ""Hospital"", the ominous thrum glowers, grows heavy, then finally gives way to mournful violin pulls and plucks. That textural push-and-pull defines the score, Bird's strings caustic against the smooth, near-perpetual hum of the organ (or maybe it's a hurdy-gurdy, or deeply distorted violin loop-- whatever it is, its pitiless drone is so reminiscent of Wendy Carlos' analog-synth soundtrack to The Shining that Bird seems bound to one day score a horror flick). Here, if not for the gentle, almost mischievous lope of ""The Kiss/Time and Space/Waterfall"", the title of which tells its own little story, the tension would be nearly unbearable. Bird has promised a new record out early next year, and if this collection can be considered any kind of preview, the arrangements will be darker, bolder, weirder-- but his songwriting, perhaps, more direct. On recent albums, especially 2009's Noble Beast, he has seemed nearly incapable of anything but lyrical abstruseness, throwing out mentions of aubergines and Cypriots like decoys, as if his cleverness would distract from his avoidance of grappling with anything more frighteningly real. Instrumentally, while ""Arcs and Coulombs"", the first of Bird's three proper songs on Norman, holds tight to brushed drums and glockenspiel (his third- and fourth-most-often-deployed tricks), but its talk of candy-apple lips and ""your serum in my veins"" are new, their borderline corniness forgivable for their offering of proof that Bird is capable of feeling, or at least transmitting, such a pedestrian sentiment as romantic infatuation. It seems to be the most straightforward love song he's ever turned out, at least until ""Night Sky"" comes along a bit later: ""What if we hadn't been born at the same time?/ What if you were 75 and I were nine?"" he wonders, supported only by a feverishly stroked acoustic guitar carried over from the preceding track. Nary a whistle, a pluck, nor an obscure scientific metaphor-- just straight-up wonder at two people somehow managing to find each other amidst the whole mess of space and time. It's a new Andrew Bird, followed shortly by the old one: ""Darkmatter"", from 2007's Armchair Apocrypha, is the only Bird song not original to the soundtrack, but here it blazes in with a cinematic bravado that all but destroys its former self. Contributions from three other artists are nestled among Bird's tracks. The Blow's Khaela Maricich lends the compilation its only female voice with ""S.O.S."", a dreamy, heavy-lidded cry for help: ""If you get a minute, would you come and look for me?"" ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son"", the crunching, stilted opener of Wolf Parade's 2005 LP Apologies to the Queen Mary, is reworked here into a darkly pulsing near-dirge, its electric guitars pushed down, Spencer Krug's yawp subdued and accented with slinky percussion and accordion wheezes. And Chad VanGaalen's ""Rabid Bits of Time"" is carried over directly from his Soft Airplane, its mournful cello slub and lonely guitar fitting it in neatly among Bird's instrumentals, VanGaalen's ragged, exhausted bleating no doubt laid over some key moment onscreen, pushing the movie and soundtrack into its cathartic final third. A soundtrack taken apart from its movie is a funny thing, especially one working in such familiar territory as Norman. It's not hard to imagine the scenes these songs must play over on screen: here's when he walks through the halls and the other kids stare, here's when he wonders how her hair smells, here's where he wonders about the vagaries of human existence and what's the point of it all, here's where they kiss, here's where they cry. Maybe it's that easy; maybe it's not. At the very least, it's beautiful.","Andrew Bird composed and performed the soundtrack to the independent film Norman.

Whatever/Whenever,Mark Sultan,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b198ea9e61561daa67ca/1:1/w_160/a021e001.jpeg,2011-10-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15935-mark-sultan-whatever-whenever/,In the Red,"Mark Sultan's plan was to release three albums this month: Whatever I Want, Whenever I Want, and a compilation of songs from each album, Whatever/Whenever. Apparently, the first two have been delayed, leaving us with this-- a handful of songs from each LP. But if the compilation is an indicator of the rest of the material, Sultan did an excellent job naming those records. These songs are exactly that-- whatever kind of track he wants to do, inspired by whichever era he chooses. Sultan-- who has pilfered from doo-wop, early-1960s rock and R&B, punk, garage, and plenty of other styles-- isn't a guy with a limited palate, so maybe he didn't want to be limited to one time period or sound or idea. In this sense, and others, Whatever/Whenever is a grab bag. The final track, for example, is an experimental free jazz song that's over eight minutes long. Surprisingly, it's the best thing on the album. Two tracks earlier, by contrast, is the gratingly repetitive ""Party Crasher"". The positive part of putting out such an uninhibited range of work? By moving into territory not covered by him or one of his various bands (the King Khan & BBQ Show, the Spaceshits, the Ding-Dongs), he's managed to make something ethereal and oddly beautiful. The negative? Whatever/Whenever is all over the place. There are quality moments, though, and songs that would fit well with the source material he's evoking. ""Song in Grey"" could stand next to an early-60s girl-group or rock song with its sunny delivery of a heartbreaking message and earworm vocal hook. But even when a song stands out, the next track cheapens it. ""Just Like Before"" follows ""Song in Grey""-- it's a breezy ukulele-wielding ballad that would've fit tidily in the Mills Brothers' catalog. And after that, ""Calloused Hands"", a fuzzy pop rocker, jumps in. Just about every song presents a new disparity, and with each subsequent track, it's a new genre or time or attitude that jumps in. It's a crowded album layout that doesn't give the songs much room to breathe. One saving grace is Sultan's croon, which is especially bold this time around. ""If I Had a Polaroid"" finds him belting out those dragging vowels he's done for a while (""daaaaaarling""). It's a great vocal performance-- he tempers the volume to sound vulnerable, and later he growls out lines for an extra emotional punch. Unfortunately, the song itself sounds like a balladized cousin of King Khan & BBQ's ""I'll Be Loving You"" and doesn't bring anything new to the table. The songs where he does kick up the tempo are a welcome addition: ""Satisfied & Lazy"" lights a rockabilly-paced fire with its heavy-handed drums and biting vocals, and ""Let Me Freeze"" is a lo-fi, minute-long song where he shouts and points back to the Circle Jerks. Songs like these deserve to shine, but Whatever/Whenever is too claustrophobic for that sort of possibility. Because Sultan casts such a wide net, it would probably be better if each song had its own 7""-- all together, it sounds like a poorly organized collection of demos and ideas.","The King Khan & BBQ Show member's latest is a hodgepodge of songs that run from free jazz, 60s pop, garage rock, and breezy acoustic ballads.

Severant,Kuedo,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19fea9e61561daa67d8/1:1/w_160/75a8b946.jpeg,2011-10-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15945-severant/,Planet Mu,"Back when he was making music with Vex'd, Jamie Teasdale was responsible for some of the more harder-edged, aggressive dubstep out there. With partner Roly Porter, the duo highlighted the genre's grimiest qualities, making industrial tracks like ""Thunder"" that sounded not unlike high-speed car crashes. But that wasn't his true calling. ""I was more the technical guy in Vex'd,"" Teasdale, now going by Kuedo, recently told the Quietus. ""A lot of the musical language came from Roly's side."" And so it turns out that Teasdale's own musical language is actually quite dreamy and even romantic. His debut LP, Severant, brings together expressive synth work and cinematic sweep with a degree of nuance and, well, prettiness that's frankly kind of surprising. Teasdale cleverly combines a few different genres here. First, through the use of vintage synth equipment, he conjures sci-fi soundscapes similar to the type deployed by Oneohtrix Point Never and Laurel Halo. With Vangelis' 1982 Blade Runner score an obvious touchstone, he layers nostalgia-hued synths in swirling, evocative patterns. But where guys like OPN like to leave these sounds untethered, Teasdale grounds them in the wobble and kick of dance music. Hearing these generally spacey tones backed by drums is cool on its own, but it's the kind of beats he chooses that really sets this record apart. Ignoring the cavernous drops of dubstep, Teasdale pulls instead from the faster, tinnier percussion of Chicago footwork and Lex Luger-style hip-hop production. This unlikely pairing creates variations in speed, color, and texture that make Severant a dynamic listen. There's constant tension between an otherworldly, futuristic feeling and this more stuttering energy that keeps the tracks earthbound. Take ""Scissors"" for an example: Teasdale floats an airy, alien organ over quick-hitting bass and machine gun hi-hats, and the result is visceral, like standing under a helicopter taking off; at the same time, there's an eerily peaceful sensation to it. He also shows a good amount of range, going moody on ""Seeing the Edges"", darkly menacing on ""Flight Path"", and even R&B-sexy with closer ""Memory Rain"". In each case the tracks avoid one-note flatness by spreading the sounds in several different directions at once. At 15 songs, Severant is long and occasionally becomes drifty, but at its best, the album is a confident, even inspired, solo debut. There are stretches where it feels like you're hearing sounds being put together for the first time, which is something that can't be said of many artists in an increasingly crowded and diluted electronic-music field. And it's not just that Teasdale cracks open a new micro-strain of music here-- call it the midpoint between experimental techno and the hip-hop street banger-- it's that he does it with a lot of warmth and nuance. Tonally these tracks are a world away from the aggro crunch of Vex'd. For other artists, there's plenty of value in that style, but Severant feels like the kind of music that this guy is intended to make.","Using Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack as a touchstone, ex-Vex'd member Jamie Teasdale's solo debut brings together expressive synth work and cinematic sweep with a surprising degree of nuance and prettiness.

Glass Swords,Rustie,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19bc0084474cd0c1e34/1:1/w_160/72ec58f5.jpeg,2011-10-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/,Warp,"Twenty years ago, Warp released Frequencies, the debut album by LFO, a duo who'd come up in the North England rave scene and scored an unexpected UK chart hit with their bold and brutal eponymous bleep techno single. This year, Warp releases Glass Swords, the debut album by Rustie, a young Glasgow producer who's come up in the protean post-dubstep scene and has yet to rough up the mainstream. (Give him time, though, especially if he catches the ear of a diva.) Most of the vinyl-only singles by LFO's revolutionary contemporaries are now sadly forgotten. In another 20 years, there's a good chance that most of the singles by Rustie's boundary-pushing peers will likewise be gathering metaphorical dust in the deep recesses of some iPod. But LFO's music has survived, and I have a feeling Rustie's will too. Because Rustie knows, like LFO knew, that the surest route to dance music immortality is to reach both the dabblers and the hardcore, marrying underground innovation with as many of electronic music's biggest ideas and best hooks as you can cram in. Frequencies kicked off with LFO literally asking, ""What is house?"" The duo's answer was the album itself. For LFO, house was everything that had already come along, from wistful Kraftwerk to future-shock electro to beatific Detroit techno. They then edited it all into short and vibrant jolts, without watering things down a bit. Glass Swords takes the same tack, to brilliant and sometimes bewildering effect. The heavy wobble of dubstep is the frame that holds everything together, but thankfully Rustie's no purist. The title track is a dreamy and disorienting merger of metal guitar and IDM ambiance, bombastic and beatless, that owes as much to a portentous Metallica intro as old-school shoegaze swirl as Daft Punk's kitschy take on progressive rock. And like the new wave of take-rave-back-to-the-kids producers, Rustie is also fearless about rehabilitating and reinventing the genre's cheesiest and most pleasurable moments, the stuff dubstep's more glower-prone producers wouldn't even claim as being part of the genre's DNA. On the so-giddy-it-feels-unstable ""Crystal Echo"", you might mistake Rustie for a happy hardcore producer brought out of retirement to remix Rihanna, all squeaky, sped-up voices and hammering drums, twinkling melodies running smack into dubstep's bass whomp. Glass Swords might just as well have opened with Rustie asking, ""What is dubstep?"" His answer is the same as LFO's was for house: Everything, but as shiny and delirious and speaker-rattling as you can make it. But Rustie is operating in a world where radio producers have already plundered dubstep for fresh sounds, and as if knowing he's now competing as much with Billboard hit-makers, his tracks have the maximalist zeal of Max Martin bubblegum. Even his most traditionally ""dubstep"" tunes won't sit still or do what they're supposed to, maniacally morphing plastic basslines and synth riffs with the sharpness of the album's titular crystal weaponry. ""Surph"" has the genre's requisite big bass drops, but Rustie also throws in pop-rave pianos, trance keyboards, and snippets of sugary R&B, because he can, because he's showing off, because it's fun, because he's never interested in just turning out another scene-pleasing exercise. He shares the make-it-immediate urge of Deadmau5 and his ilk but has no time for their simplicity or brutality. One of the best things about Glass Swords is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks-- as you'd expect from a Warp album-- whether we're talking their classic-era IDM records or more recent signings like Flying Lotus. ""Cry Flames"" has more of metal's brute force in its gnarled groove, but the real shiver-inducing moment comes when Rustie begins weaving a fragile, almost Satie-like piano melody into the bass snarl. All that said, there's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a ""greatest bits"" collage. A lot of déjà vu elements are worked onto the framework of a current club trend, little hints of everything from Art of Noise to U-Ziq to the S.O.S. Band to old RPG soundtracks colliding with dubstep's bass pressure. But compared to the sterile sound of most retro-collage electronic albums, it's also an undeniable and up-to-the-minute rush. And in a couple of decades, when you're looking for an instant hit of what electronic pop felt like in 2011, you'll be able to throw on Glass Swords and get a dose of that feeling in its purest form.","On his debut, this young Glasgow post-dubstep producer seems to understand that the surest route to dance music immortality is to reach both the dabblers and the hardcore by marrying innovation with hooks.

Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a69d034d5c69bf4a60/1:1/w_160/edc93ab8.jpeg,2011-10-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15944-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-st/,Sour Mash,"Oasis perpetually faced accusations of over-borrowing from rock history, unapologetically nicking words and melodies from the biggest groups of all time. But the band were also skilled samplers of rock'n'roll storylines, arriving in the early 1990s pre-equipped with that classic intra-band conflict, the singer vs. the songwriter. The tension between Noel and Liam Gallagher arrived with Oasis in the early 90s as a fully-formed rock drama worthy of Keith-Mick, Robert-Jimmy, and Rog-Pete, given added juice by shared genetics. With Chekhov's gun inevitability, their squabbles blew Oasis apart in 2009, with the final indignity of forcing Noel, the band's master architect, to quit his own masterpiece project via blog post. So here begins the familiar second act of the rock'n'roll story arc, the competitive-solo-record period. While Liam and the rest of Oasis got in the first punch (reforming and flicking Vs at their former bandleader as Beady Eye), Noel has launched his High Flying Birds ""collective"" with a premise that's also rock canon: who needs a frontman, anyway? Oasis history already gives Noel some credibility on that front-- by their second album, the guitarist was already taking lead vox duties on a hit single (""Don't Look Back in Anger""), and the notorious MTV Unplugged episode proved he could do just fine without his brother on the band's other material, thank you very much. But for a declaration of independence, the self-titled High Flying Birds LP sounds awfully nostalgic for the good old days. Through most of the mercifully brief 10 tracks, Gallagher passes on the opportunity to use this new career chapter for either an Albarn-like experimental exploration or something stripped-down and personal. Of course, nothing in his career to date would suggest ""stripped-down"" is in Noel's vocabulary. His new band goes straight back to the widescreen aesthetic, with choirs, string sections, horn sections, and choruses aiming for the universal. Noel is still writing for the stadium-- it's the only audience he knows. Keeping that in mind, a listener can forgive a lot of corniness, even as Noel tests the limits. At this point, it's almost endearing that he earnestly sees no problem starting a song with the lyric, ""Hot time/ Summer in the city,"" and thinks the clunky ""(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine"" is an acceptable song title and hook. But the latter track also shows Gallagher can still tickle anyone who once took the kind of soaring-orchestra-and-guitar-solo bridge (think Slash emerging from a pool of water in the rain) seriously. If the emotional power of anthemic rock is quickly draining, Gallagher remains among the best conductors of the fumes. Still, there are some intriguing ideas buried under the maudlin arrangements and verse-chorus-verses. Often, the most interesting parts of the songs float frustratingly on the periphery of the mix, as with the lap steel of ""If I Had a Gun…"" or the musical saw that eerily haunts both ""The Death of You and Me"" and ""AKA… Broken Arrow"". One place where that formula reverses promisingly is ""AKA… What a Life!"", which is built upon a stormy piano loop, filtered drums, and Noel's melancholic take on 20 years of stardom. The song is a reminder that Gallagher might have found a more exciting solo path by revisiting ""Setting Sun"", the Oasis-related moment that sounds most vital in 2011 (and perhaps the inspiration for his upcoming collab with Future Sound of London side project the Amorphous Androgynous). But instead he chooses to make another MTV Unplugged statement that's equal parts self-sufficient and self-conscious, all but writing in Liam and the rest of Beady Eye drunkenly heckling from the balcony. Founding High Flying Birds on pretty much the same musical territory as his old band, where Liam's snide yowl will always win out over Noel's passable but pedestrian voice, is the album's critical flaw. Forever a slave to rock history, Gallagher feels like he's biding his time for the third act reunion rather than breaking from the well-trod path.","With Liam Gallagher of Oasis fronting his Beady Eye project, his brother Noel has launched his own new band. For a declaration of independence, the group's debut sounds awfully nostalgic for the good old days.

Days,Real Estate,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17eea9e61561daa67aa/1:1/w_160/dc7156db.jpg,2011-10-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days/,Domino,"For a mix of songs made at different times, Real Estate's self-titled 2009 debut was impressively consistent. Given how well the New Jersey band fused disparate moments, you had to figure they could reach even greater heights were they to craft their next set all at once. They did just that last winter, and the result is indeed a step forward. Cleaner, sharper, and just plain stronger, Days is like a single idea divided into simple statements-- a suite of subtle variations on a theme. Its coherence sounds remarkably effortless, as if stringing together catchy gems is as easy as, in the words of one song, ""floating on an inner tube in the sun."" Interestingly, Real Estate actually acknowledge this sense of ease. The opener is bluntly titled ""Easy"", and references to carefree simplicity abound. As singer/guitarist Martin Courtney puts it, ""If it takes all summer long/ Just to write one simple song/ There's too much to focus on/ Clearly there is something wrong."" But the band's celebration of the uncomplicated is less about how Days was written than about the beauty of life seen in retrospect, especially young life in small towns. Like the stirring scenes of suburban Texas in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, these songs find meaning in daily mundanities-- in houses and gardens, phone lines and street lights, names carved in trees and leaves pressed by footsteps. ""All those wasted miles/ All those aimless drives through green aisles,"" sings Courtney wistfully. ""Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise."" That sentiment was evident on the band's debut, but here they've honed it to its essence. The music bears a simplicity to match. These aren't minimal songs by any means, but the layers of cycling guitar, rolling rhythm, and gentle echo are always understated, more about conveying feeling than showing off the band's considerable chops. There's also a smooth efficiency in these rich tunes. No note feels wasted, and nothing happens at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Much of this precision comes from guitarist Matt Mondanile, whose nimble playing adds color to each song's shape. It's most noticeable in the insistent ""It's Real"", but I'm even more taken with his sonic smoke rings in ""Out of Tune"", and how his shimmering guitar evokes sunrays mingling through branches and sparkling off pools. That idyllic tone permeates Days, and in lesser hands could deprive it of tension or variety. But Real Estate have such a knack for classic-sounding melody that every song quickly engages on a musical gut level. It's a quality their music shares with the jangly hooks of early R.E.M., the breeziness of later Pavement, and the garage twang of the Fresh & Onlys. But their closest kin are New Jersey forefathers the Feelies. That group's undying ability to mine repeated chords and Zen phrases is matched best by the album's closer, ""All the Same"", a looping study of how night and day are merely sides of the same coin. Lasting over seven minutes, it might be Real Estate's first epic. But it's as subtle and unassuming as anything on Days-- more evidence from this band that great music doesn't have to sound hard to make, even if it is.","Cleaner, sharper, and stronger than the quartet's excellent 2009 self-titled debut, Days is like a single idea divided into simple statements.

Twirligig,Jonti,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b172c0084474cd0c1df8/1:1/w_160/706b191c.jpeg,2011-10-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15909-jonti-twirligig/,Stones Throw,"The weird thing about early synthesized pop was that it made a quick, self-aware leap from signifying a shiny, electronic future to a sense of cheery, almost inane frothiness. Early Moog-tweaking musicians and engineers spent a lot of time figuring out how to electronically warp the work of baroque composers into ironic juxtapositions between tradition and technology, but eventually they had to come to terms with the fact that much of it still registered as grotesque distortions of nuanced melody. And for every musique concrète and BBC Radiophonic Workshop genius who turned those limitations into successfully arresting experiments, there was someone like Jean-Jacques Perrey who thrived on the potential of the equipment's inherent pop goofiness. Combine the cheerfully dippy, utopian enthusiasm of late-1960s electronic music with the more whimsical strains of the same era's psychedelic experimentation, and the end result can be clamorously demented at worst. Or best. Of course, it means something drastically different to invoke that synthemesc horrorshow now that it's 40-plus years in the past, what with a couple of dozen hours' worth of Gary Wilson, Stereolab, and Black Moth Super Rainbow having had their say in the intervening decades. Twirligig is the first full-length album from Sydney multi-instrumentalist Jonti Danilewitz, and if it follows those aforementioned artists' archly playful approach to retrofuturist synth-psych, it also embodies it in odd, frivolous little songs that are as intricately constructed as they are naggingly irritating. Once the second track and highlight ""Nightshift in Blue"" is done working its sun-bleached, rubber-limbed Pet Sounds vibe, the rest of the album falls into a succession of woozy, disorienting, somewhat uncomfortable assemblages of brow-furrowing sketch-songs that often amble along a little too preciously for their own good. Sometimes the tone is overly quirky: ""Firework Spraying Moon"" and ""Begone Slumber"" are short, slight, and often pretty, but in a way that seems too slapstick, like the notebook-paper-doodled title sequence to your typical indie comedy film. Sometimes it's almost obnoxiously overstuffed with noise, albeit in a half-speed, low-energy way, as in ""Spooky Sport"" and the layers of screeching bird/rubber/guitar/Atari ambiance that make its quasi-Polynesian swoon so bracing. And sometimes it feigns one of those moods before dropping the other on you. ""Nodlews Way Home"" stabs its ambling, mellow blues lope between the shoulder blades with a piercing, oscillating synthesizer squall that seems to be drunkenly picking a fight with the rest of the song. And the title track feels like two half-finished ideas haphazardly stapled together to make a quarter-finished song, a rhythm-machine and faux-Theremin reverie pushed unceremoniously toward a fuzz-synth drone through a tunnel of overbearing distortion. But credit where it's due: Irritation and bafflement might actually be part of the intent, especially when they're so often used to cut through moments that would otherwise feel a bit pat in their serenity. It clearly took a lot of work to assemble some of these noisy, chirpy things, and there are a number of odd little details of four-track alchemy to unearth, even though the bulk of the songs clock in at less time than your average commercial break. It's pretty dense stuff: Every sound melts into itself with such viscous goopiness that eventually it's easy to forget that what you're listening to may have involved instruments at some point, rather than just the residue of some kind of ancient digital ectoplasm. It is a bit ephemeral, but not quite as music to relax to-- more like music to be bewildered by. And there's real craft in the way Jonti manipulates his multitracked vocals, pulling them apart to disorienting, clashing effect or merging them into seamless harmony. In either case, he's got a good sense of how to shape his voice into power-pop harmonic wonderment. It's not a good enough sense to avoid having it buried in the mix, rendering the occasional lyrics not only indecipherable but almost beside the point. But sometimes you've just got to let the machines win.","The first full-length from Sydney multi-instrumentalist Jonti Danilewitz showcases an archly playful approach to retrofuturist synth-psych via intricately constructed oddball songs and other noisy, chirpy things.

Staring at the X,Forest Fire,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18ab1335d7bf169a2ca/1:1/w_160/ec7b554a.jpeg,2011-10-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15925-forest-fire-staring-at-the-x/,Fat Cat,"Much of the indie rock coming out of the Pacific Northwest in the mid 1990s had a particular, cross-eyed stare: one eye looking to the cosmos, the other to the dirt. Something about the music felt both gigantic and life-sized, characterized by a seamless mingling of the mythic and the quotidian. This was how Isaac Brock could stare at the queue at a dying shopping mall's Orange Julius and see a metaphor for an existential purgatory, or how Doug Martsch, in his friendly, slacker lilt, could have late night bro-to-bro conversations with the Big Dipper. The New York band Forest Fire don't sound much like early Modest Mouse or Built to Spill, but one of the exciting things about their debut, the sleeper hit Survival, was that it recalled the spirit of indie rock's feet-on-the-ground, eyes-to-the-sky stance. There was a lackadaisical quality to its casually strummed guitars and to Mark Thresher's easygoing drawl, but embedded within what a cursory listen might mistakenly dismiss as sonic shrugs was something that felt decidedly and almost deceptively epic. It was one of those records that would always trick you into forgetting it was only 29 minutes long. It was also easy to forget that Forest Fire were from Brooklyn. Not just because of the sweeping sprawl of their sound, but because they seemed to exist, in 2008 anyway, somewhere just outside of the churn of the hype machine. Released as a free download through the tiny but formidable blog-based imprint Catbird Records, Survival built an audience mainly through blogs and ended up appearing on (and even, in a few instances, topping) some notable year-end lists. A vote for Survival was a vote against buzz, as it seemed to gesture toward a whole, wide internet dense with undiscovered gems. Three years later, the digital landscape into which Forest Fire release their second LP feels more cluttered and complicated for sure, but they've still got a rogue streak to their image. One of their press bios claims that Forest Fire ""reject the 'what's next' attitude plaguing so many of the NYC/Brooklyn scene,"" which-- as far as Amazon.com editorial lines go-- sound like fighting words. Fortunately, Staring at the X doesn't need them; it's good enough-- and weird enough-- to assert these kinds of claims on its own. Signs of the band's development are scattered all over the record's first two minutes. Gone are Survival's campfire strums, and in their place some fuzzed-out, Martsch-sized riffage that unfurls across ""Born Into""'s expansive sprawl. And in true Forest Fire fashion, there's plenty more sprawl where that came from. Clocking in at six-and-a-half minutes, the record's most extreme departure is also one of its standout moments: the sinister, hypnotic, bass-driven space-groove ""They Pray Execution Style"" (featuring perfectly deadpan lead vocals by multi-instrumentalist Natalie Stormann). Forest Fire swing between long stretches of darkness and sudden sunbursts (""The News""), and occasionally these two impulses compete within a single song. The ostensibly sprightly ""Future Shadows"" is a meditation on love and death, concluding with Thresher's steady-voiced admission, ""I am afraid/ And I'm on my way."" Staring at the X ambles and meanders-- occasionally too much for its own good. Its second half in particular stays at a pretty uniform and sluggish tempo, which will make you long for such pop interruptions as the infectious single ""The News"" provided on Side A. As on Survival, Forest Fire are at their best when they're teasing out the formal contrasts in their sound, pivoting expertly between spacey slowburners and compact pop gems. But even more so than their promising debut, Staring at the X proves them to be a commendably ambitious band with the chops to carry out even their most far-flung ideas.","When Forest Fire released their 2008 debut, the band seemed to exist somewhere just outside the hype machine. Three years later, the digital landscape feels more cluttered and complicated, but the Brooklyn indie rock quartet still has a rogue streak.

An Ache for the Distance,The Atlas Moth,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19ab1335d7bf169a2e0/1:1/w_160/431515c7.jpeg,2011-10-17 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15936-an-ache-for-the-distance/,Profound Lore,"""Horse Thieves"" is the final and best track on An Ache for the Distance, the second album by Chicago's distorted doom squadron the Atlas Moth. It opens with a pit-of-hell black-metal sigh: Vocalist/guitarist Stavros Giannopoulos sounds as malevolent as Malefic once did on Sunn O)))'s Black One, when the Xasthur leader infamously recorded his vocal parts from inside a coffin that was itself inside a Cadillac hearse. Appropriately, Giannopoulos sings of the end with apocalyptic imagery, a would-be horseman requesting that a ""divine mare"" help him spread an unspoken plague. ""Our light has been eclipsed, the tides washing ashore,"" he screams, his voice so serrated, his tone so saturated, that the words are barely decipherable. The sound is threatening enough, with words or not. Indeed, even during what turns out to be a fairly indelible chorus, ""Horse Thieves""'s voices vacillate between dark, darker, and darkest. It's like a seven-minute history of the progression of black-metal vocals from the basements of Oslo 20 years ago to, these days, high-end recording studios. But the Atlas Moth aren't a black metal band-- at all. Rather, they're one of a growing legion of bands to use bits of that form-- and, really, everything from stoner metal to psychedelic rock, free jazz to electric blues-- to make militantly adventurous heavy metal. In fact, when Giannopoulos is howling his imprecations during ""Horse Theives"", he's backed by a slow, stubborn, swaggering blues riff and a rhythm section that has more to do with Mono's escalating brood than Mayhem's shrieking ferocity. Jamie Branch streaks the song's bridge with trumpet hiss, while Andrew Ragin puts down his guitar to add eerie piano jet wash. It all sounds like some awesome, evil vaudeville after-party that, after an impasse, somehow erupts into a sludgy sing-along about a serpent's tongue and staying alive. Such patent unpredictability and versatility fuel the entirety of An Ache for the Distance, a dense, 45-minute listen that never seems to stop revealing new aspects and assets. The Atlas Moth are an excellent three-guitar quintet as capable of heroic, spiraling leads (see the start of ""Coffin Varnish"") as they are thick, interlocking lines that serve more as a working matrix for the lyrics, as with ""Your Calm Waters"". Giannopoulos takes the lead on that track, crying out for a commitment of assistance should he not make it out alive. ""Before you climb off, check the pulse/ Bring me back to life,"" he yells. His call is actually answered by David Kush, the Atlas Moth's sort of hook singer (the liner notes credit him with ""clean vocals""). Throughout Distance, he and Giannopoulos trade lines and parts, occasionally creating conversations between hope and despair. Lyrically, Distance is anchored on old-fashioned worry for the future; as with those blues guitars and rock'n'roll drums, Kush's hooks, which strangely split the difference between Hawkwind and Hot Topics, create tension for Giannopoulos' protestations. They make his bleak seem that much bleaker. What's more, Kush's singing prevents the album's one collaboration from seeming out of place. Mark Solotroff is best known for his work in power electronics as Bloodyminded, but on ""Courage"", he sings like Mark Kozelek fronting Jesu. The unlikely ballad offers a perfect respite for Distance's general roar and, once again, reveals another capability of the band without squandering too much of the album's propulsion. The divide between advocates for purity and post-everything blends feels particularly polarized right now-- not just in metal or even music, but in entertainment at large and politics. The Atlas Moth certainly falls into the latter category, churning ideas sometimes considered mutually exclusive inside one relentless package. Importantly, though, it feels neither like a pastiche nor like a pretense. On only their second album, the Atlas Moth have successfully captured a signature, singular mix of ideas and impulses, quickly covering a distance that others waste careers trying to match.","The Atlas Moth use bits of black metal-- and, really, everything, from stoner metal to psychedelic rock, free jazz to electric blues-- to make militantly adventurous music. The three-guitar Chicago quintet's sophomore album never stops revealing new aspects and assets.

The Great Escape Artist,Jane's Addiction,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b174ea9e61561daa679e/1:1/w_160/a4d0f693.jpeg,2011-10-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15910-janes-addiction/,Capitol,"The year 1991 was a significant one in Jane's Addiction lore, marking both the launch of the L.A. art-rockers' Lollapalooza travelling-circus experiment and the announcement of the band's dissolution. Now, on the 20th anniversary of those events, both brands are still making headlines, despite enduring extended periods of inactivity, aborted restarts, and organizational restructuring. And it's perhaps no coincidence that both Jane's Addiction and Lollapalooza have evolved in exactly the same way: What were once unpredictable, chaotic forces have inevitably mutated into well-oiled, monolithic entities bearing little of the charm and character of their original incarnations. This circumstance is not lost on frontman/Lolla visionary Perry Farrell who, on Jane's Addiction's new album, proudly declares, ""We've become a big business/ A galaxy merger!"" Even if that line is intended to be a metaphor for a blossoming romantic relationship, the fact that Farrell's singing of love in the language of commerce effectively sums up the proficient but perfunctory nature of The Great Escape Artist, Jane's Addiction's fifth official album, their second comeback record (following 2003's Strays), and the first release since the short-lived reintroduction of founding bassist Eric Avery into the fold for a 2009 tour. No doubt, their various attempts to keep Jane's alive over the past decade have taught Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, and drummer Stephen Perkins that replacing Avery requires more than just finding a talented bass player. In many respects, Avery defined the band's sonic identity and mystique; think of any Jane's classic, and often the first thing that pops into your head is one of those ominous, propulsive basslines. So while the middling Strays tried to plug session vet Chris Chaney into the dynamic, for The Great Escape Artist, the band makes a more concerted effort at revitalization, recruiting everyone from TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek to Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan to Morocco's Master Musicians of Joujouka-- a trifecta of collaborators who respectively play to Jane's Addiction's affinities for heady atmosphere, raunchy hard rock, and tribal-percussion jams. At the outset, The Great Escape Artist lives up to that on-paper potential: Farrell's freak-scene re-indoctrination ""Underground"" and Avery-directed invective ""End to the Lies"" (featuring the Joujouka crew) open the album with a pair of promisingly authoritative metallic grinds that sound like they were grafted from the slow-motion mid-section of Ritual de lo Habitual's ""Stop"", but with Sitek's chrome-plated textures adding a post-apocalyptic ambience that greatly complements Navarro's eerie six-string squeals. But there's a palpable dip in intensity from there on in, as The Great Escape Artist gets mired in the not-quite-rock/not-quite-ballad purgatory that defines so much post-grunge alt-radio. As slickly produced as Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual were, you always got the sense that Jane's Addiction were a band of four interconnected personalities contributing distinct, individual parts to the majestic whole. But even compared to the nu-metalloid sheen of Strays, The Great Escape Artist's intricate, heavily lacquered production-- courtesy of Muse-man Rich Costey-- has the effect of making Jane's Addiction sound like an anonymous assemblage of oversaturated recording tracks. More so than Avery's commanding presence, what's really missing here is Jane's Addiction's sense of playfulness, absurdity, and rhythmic verve. Beyond hard-charging closer ""Words Right Out of My Mouth"", powerhouse drummer Perkins is given scant opportunity to flex his percussive muscle and is instead relegated to playing the mild-mannered time-keeper on melodramatic turns like ""Twisted Tales"" and ""Splash a Little Water on It"", while Sitek's bass contributions are barely perceptible underneath the glossy sheen. And for a frontman who's always been happy to flaunt his own ridiculousness, Farrell is surprisingly humorless here, the quirky character studies and brash swagger of old replaced by straight-faced pleading and vague second-person admonishments. Sure, the line, ""You were the foreskin/ I was the real head,"" reads as hilarious but, coming from a Jew, probably isn't meant as a term of endearment. There is, however, one song here-- ""Broken People""-- that cuts through The Great Escape Artist's sleek surface and provides a glimpse of the charismatic, affective band that Jane's once were and still could be. (Surprisingly, it's one of McKagan's three co-writes.) And, as per the standard set by ""I Would For You"", ""Jane Says"", and ""Then She Did..."", ""Broken People"" is a melancholic reverie dedicated to a tragic female protagonist, though instead calling upon his usual cast of junkies and eccentrics, Farrell updates the archetype to paint a sympathetic portrait of a sex-vid-shilling celebutante. Despite the sensationalistic subject matter, Jane's treat it with an understated elegance, thanks to Navarro's beautifully restrained guitar line, a sensitive but not mawkish vocal from Farrell, and-- rare for this album-- a concise, unfussy arrangement; even the amped-up, fist-pump treatment applied to the third verse can't sully the song's graceful sway. In a world where truly nothing is shocking, Jane's Addiction have understandably lost the will and desire to be as outrageous and confrontational as they once were. But as ""Broken People"" attests, the most effective way for a big business to surprise you is through a simple, humble act of charity.","On the 20th anniversary of their initial dissolution, the alt-rock OGs release an album produced by Muse-man Rich Costey and featuring TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek and Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan, among others.

"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming",M83,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14c9d034d5c69bf49d5/1:1/w_160/be990fa7.jpg,2011-10-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/,Mute,"Late last year, Anthony Gonzalez announced his next album was almost complete and would be ""very, very, very epic."" With all due respect, consider the redundancy of that statement: Since 2003 breakthrough Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, every new and increasingly colossal M83 studio record has led to widespread crowdsourcing of synonyms for ""epic."" What exactly was he promising other than simply another album? Well, throughout the past decade, the 30-year old Gonzalez has honored the tremendous impact of growing up during the golden age of CD buying by implicitly serving as a patron saint for those who treat the weekly trip to the record store as a pilgrimage and still covet the album as a physical proposition: His output always comes stylishly packaged, with cover art worth obsessing over and credits that need to be scoured in order to spot the guest appearances. Unsurprisingly, he ups the ante here by aspiring to what is still the paradigm of artistic permanence, both in terms of legacy and tactility: the double album, that occasionally ambitious, usually decadent, and almost always fascinatingly flawed endeavor of musicians convinced (rightfully or otherwise) that they're at the peak of their own powers. Hurry Up, We're Dreaming might be all of those things, but above all else, it's the best M83 record yet. But let's talk about restraint for a moment: While each side of Hurry Up would be oddly slight for an M83 album, the demands of its 74-minute runtime are hardly daunting. It's actually the easiest M83 album to consume in one sitting, a reverse accumulation of past strengths that makes for Gonzalez's most compact and combustive music yet. He continues the path set by Saturdays=Youth by easing out of the mini-movie business in exchange for pop songcraft, while trading that LP's pretty-in-pink pastels for the urban neons and fluorescents of Before the Dawn Heals Us and embodying Dead Cities' mile-wide expansiveness. But the most crucial change is how touring with the likes of Depeche Mode has inspired a newfound showmanship in his vocals: Previously, Gonzalez enlisted outside help, piped in plot-advancing narratives, or sang in a low, tentative murmur that submitted to its massive surroundings. But here, within the first minutes of ""Intro"", he's matching blows with the juggernaut bellow of Zola Jesus' Nika Danilova to the point where it's much tougher than you'd think to tell them apart. It's really not too different from the first chords of ""Planet Telex"" or Lil Wayne's ""Tha Mobb"" in terms of being an unmistakable sign that you're going to be listening to this familiar act differently. M83 have never stood for half measures in any aspect, but Gonzalez is absolutely going for it here in a way that sheds new light on known tricks: The hair-triggered drum rolls of ""New Map"" recall Before the Dawn's searing car-crash fantasy ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"", but Gonzalez's nervy punctuation at the end of each line sells the idea that he's along for the ride this time rather than being a passive observer. Dead Cities' ""In Church"" was the sound of blissful acquiescence, but amidst the swaggering synth-metal of ""Midnight City"", Gonzalez hollers, ""The city is my church!"" empowered and present, finding a voice for the evangelical zeal always implicit in his work. Gonzalez has stressed Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as a major inspiration (and by extension, its forefather, The Wall), and its influence can be spotted in Hurry Up's power ballads ""Wait"" and ""My Tears Are Becoming a Sea"", sumptuously arranged tracks that could still be played solo on an acoustic guitar. Thankfully, he didn't retain much from ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" or ""The Trial"", and rather than one man lashing out at the world from the safety of his own thematic construct, you feel that Gonzalez is trying to connect with it. As such, the moments of indulgence are in service of the album's most endearing and silly emotions: Some might consider ""Raconte-Moi Une Histoire"" a throwaway because it's ""the one about a magic frog,"" but besides embodying the whiplash emotions of youth by following the magnificent melancholy of ""Wait"", its almost eerie brightness and Windows 95-era sound effects capture a technological optimism better than a lot of artists who are trying only to do that. Meanwhile, ""Year One, One UFO"" attempts to distill the percussion-mad, organic ecstasy of Vision Creation Newsun into three minutes, while on the opposite side, ""Claudia Lewis"" and ""OK Pal"" show a mastery of slapbass-poppin', corporate funk-rock comparable to Ford & Lopatin or Cut Copy without the twinge of pastiche. As with any double album, there's a temptation to strip away the instrumental tracks or simply pick the best 50 minutes for your daily commute. But the interludes here are intended to be every bit as purposeful as the singles: The shorter the track, the more evocative its title (""Where the Boats Go"", ""Train to Pluton"", ""Another Wave From You""). While many of them stand as intriguing meditations on their own merits, they reinforce Hurry Up's intentions to be an immersive universe-- check in whenever you want, but the magic's in the exploratory phases. And why leave out what falls in between, like the thermite burst of the two-minute ""This Bright Flash"" or the stately ""When Will You Come Home?""-to-""My Tears Are Becoming a Sea"" triptych that serves as the connective transit between Side 1 and Side 2. Then again, I can't blame anyone who takes shortcuts, since the traditionally structured songs here are some of the most thrilling pop music released this year. The heavily saturated synths Gonzalez favored early in his career invited plenty of My Bloody Valentine comparisons, but whereas pure shoegaze of that nature attempts to overwhelm and obliterate, Hurry Up is like a sonic planetarium, penetrable and totally geared toward enhancing the user experience. Few artists make more ingenious use of the sheer physics of rock to this extent-- defining which synth pads strike which emotional pressure points, using percussion as explosives rather than mere elements of timekeeping, coiling the tension of a verse to make every chorus feel phenomenally cathartic even without any words. At this point in the year, you'd think a saxophone solo would have lost all the novelty it had accumulated over decades of disuse, yet when one pops up at the end of ""Midnight City"", it triumphantly squires the track out at the highest point possible. After a streak of staccato guitar chords and splashy cymbal hits rev up ""Reunion"", the shouts from its chorus could come from a soccer stadium or a speedboat chase. ""Intro"" is typical of Gonzalez's love for zero-gravity arrangements of massed choirs and cathedral reverb, but there's nothing buzzy or clouded about it-- as high as he takes things, you can still see everything underneath in crisp, butterflies-inducing depth and detail. And then there's ""Steve McQueen"", which somehow makes the preceding hour of music feel like its prelude. Point blank, it's as close as most of us will get to being strapped inside a space shuttle, as midway through an almost unbearably tensile verse, you don't hear drums so much as afterburners kicking in. By the chorus, it simply cannot go further up, and it explodes at the perfect moment into hair-metal guitar chords and synth-led skywriting. And yet, because it's almost impossible to say what ""Steve McQueen"" is about (certainly not the actor), it's capable of glorifying anything you choose-- a slow motion shot of Kirk Gibson rounding the bases in the 1988 World Series, a holiday fireworks display, or getting into your car and simply celebrating the end of an exhausting day. Is it a lot to handle? Of course, and those who have yet to connect with M83 may wonder if the sort of incapacitating longing expressed by ""Wait"" can possibly be experienced by anyone over the age of 16 or whether they'll ever be able to afford the stereo equipment seemingly required for its intended effect. But remember, it's called Hurry Up, We're Dreaming: It doesn't attempt to be a comprehensive or even realistic purview of the human experience, and lord knows there's plenty out there that's meant to capture small moments. It's easy to mistrust something so irrepressibly optimistic about the affective possibilities of music and to attribute these feelings to the domain of some ""other,"" whether it's the 1980s, teenhood, or a pop product. Does it share some sort of commonality with ""Born This Way"" or ""Firework"", or any other entry from 2011's chart music that attempts to convince you of your own superstardom? Surely, but Gonzalez never comes off like he's selling a brand, a lifestyle, or even himself-- his lyrics remain as opaque as ever. Hurry Up instead serves as a framework to realize the marvelous capability of our dreams and daily lives, should we be open to experiencing it.","Since 2003's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, M83 mastermind Anthony Gonzalez has created increasingly colossal records. His latest, a double album that serves as a framework to realize the marvelous capability of our dreams and daily lives, could be his best record yet.

Enemy/Lover,Dreamers of the Ghetto,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b192c0084474cd0c1e2c/1:1/w_160/67eaba9a.png,2011-10-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15931-enemylover/,Temporary Residence,"Dreamers of the Ghetto frontman Luke Jones has this great big voice; not just recording-booth big, but grain-silo big, the kind so rousing, so grandiose, it'd overpower anything short of an anthem. And so Dreamers of the Ghetto write anthems, all these great big songs to go with their frontman's great big voice. Enemy/Lover, their debut LP, is not just indie rock-club big. It's mainstage big. Listening to Enemy/Lover, it takes no stretch of the imagination to see the band's long name inching its way toward the top of all sorts of bills in the months ahead. Enemy/Lover works in widescreen, searching verses crashing into sweeping choruses, Jones shouting big questions at the sky. Towering and triumphal, Dreamers take most of their cues from stadium-fillers from U2 to Springsteen to indie overgrounders like Arcade Fire and the National. I sometimes hear an optimism-infused spin on much-missed Canadian rockers Constantines; listen close, and you'll pick up hints of Rod Stewart, Simple Minds, and Coldplay. It's not that Dreamers of the Ghetto sound especially like any one of these, but that they sound a bit like all of them, and just about anybody else who's ever stretched the canvas out as far as it goes. Nearly every note on Enemy/Lover is pitched as far as it'll fly; subtlety, as befits a band who would call itself Dreamers of the Ghetto, isn't exactly job one. More room under the big tent that way, I reckon. A panoramic guitar figure and a stampede of drums set the scene for the ponderous ""State of a Dream"", a slice of Inception-style uncertainty blown up to billboard size. It's bettered by ""Connection"", its bleary, solitary organ giving way to its towering chorus, ""When you're gone, I know you're with me."" This is no mild disruption in the REM cycle or absence-addled fondness; both songs find Jones practically doubled-over from pleading, bouncing those lines off a (for now, imaginary) sea of thousands. The constant craving in Jones' throat keeps Enemy/Lover well-suited for a solitary bedroom hideout, but its insistent songs aim for anyone within earshot. The Dreamers aren't seeking some midpoint between intimacy and grandiosity, they're aiming for both at once; that same combination's kept Bono in leather and wraparounds for decades now, a rarified territory these Dreamers seem almost born into. The band's gaping chords and roaring percussion rarely snag the spotlight from Jones' voice; when it does, as on the oscillating guitar that closes out ""Regulator"", what could easily turn to empty embellishment feels instead like an elevation of the song itself. Again, decorum's not their strongest suit, but when they swing a line from the aforementioned ""Regulator"" back around into ""Dark Falcons"", it suggests that there are plenty of small pleasures to be found amidst Enemy/Lover's biggie-sized wallop. It's the sort of record you locate yourself in, its concerns universal, its populist appeal easy to grasp, its songs at once moving and movable. Stirring as they can be, a couple of Enemy/Lover's sky-streaking melodies seem to stick to a similar flightpath. And at times, the Dreamers' all-encompassing approach proves a little too ecumenical, its arms outstretched too wide to pull you in close. But those are the risks you run when you're operating on such a grand scale, and the exultant, openhearted Enemy/Lover is rarely outpaced by its lofty ambitions.","On their debut, Bloomington, Indiana's Dreamers of the Ghetto write great big songs to go with their frontman Luke Jones' great big voice.

The Abandoned Lullaby,Icebird,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b180b1335d7bf169a2b8/1:1/w_160/31a4a4ed.jpeg,2011-10-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15919-icebird-the-abandoned-lullaby/,RJ's Electrical Connections,"As shaky as his output was in the years since he first set hip hop orthodoxy aside, writing RJD2 off as a total loss seems premature. The Third Hand's dippy bedroom-pop flopped in the way that only abrupt stylistic detours can, but when he honed that lite-funk sound on last year's decent-enough follow-up The Colossus, he seemed on his way toward actually taking it into appealing places. Factor in this year's oddball side project as the Insane Warrior, the 1980s horror soundtrack/electro-prog/library music pastiche We Are the Doorways, and he's already put out a couple of solid pieces of work in the last few years that retain his adventurous nature without letting the burden of his early rep stifle him. Maybe all he really needs to do is keep working out the kinks and find a way to let his beat-making chops translate more readily into traditional song arrangement. Plus, teaming up with a pretty good vocalist wouldn't hurt. Enter Aaron Livingston, a singer originally out of Philly who flirted with fame via a guest spot on the Roots' ""Guns Are Drawn"" and showed up on The Colossus six years later to lend his talents to ""Crumbs Off the Table"". That went so well that Livingston and RJ recorded another dozen songs under the name Icebird, and if The Abandoned Lullaby is the best piece of evidence so far to justify RJD2 Mk. II, it's also a good showcase for an eccentric singer on the verge of reaching a wide, receptive audience. Both parties click together because they're willing to let genre be an afterthought, yet they still avoid succumbing to a rootless, stylistically overreaching identity crisis. Identity crises being what they've been over RJD2's career, the fact that he's pulled together a number of familiar elements from his past repertoire is unsurprising but well-executed. Fans enamored with the rangy, all-things-1970s blowout Since We Last Spoke will find some good moments to grab on here-- there's still no gymnastic drum-break sample flipping, but RJ's geeky ear for cross-genre fusion pays off in a similarly satisfying way. The ""Move on Up"" vibe of ""Just Love Me"" and the minor-key, piano-driven skulk of ""Please, Don't"" are retro-funk 101, but their straightforwardness is driven by a marked flair for percussive arrangements that hit with more oomph than anything on his last two solo records. And his sense of ambition starts cresting on the album's dramatic, moody second half, where he indulges in the best instincts of his prog affinity to ends both icily ambient (""The Return of Tronson"") and arena-rock heavy (""Gun for Hire""). Livingston, meanwhile, makes for a good foil to RJ's occasionally grandiose production. There are moments where he switches from a casually conversational way of singing into a full-on jolt of unadulterated joy or frustration with Swiss-watch timing. He works his raspy tenor well enough to make the moments where he drops flat, bum notes (like the quasi-Egyptian chorus in ""King Tut"") more of a jokey, self-aware idiosyncrasy than actual sandbagging. Best of all, he's got enough charisma to break out of pro-forma neo-soul roles: an optimist getting frustrated in the face of aggravating bullshit on ""Going and Going. And Going"", the desperately haunted lover on ""Spirit Ache"", the recidivist begging not to be led back into temptation on ""Please, Don't"". He doesn't have the show-stopping voice or the lyrical incisiveness of a Cee-Lo to justify the surface-level Gnarls Barkley comparisons The Abandoned Lullaby might rack up-- and RJ's not quite at the full command of a landmark signature sound like Danger Mouse was a couple of years back, either. But if there's been a better two-man indie-funk producer/singer superduo to come out of the woodwork since ""Crazy"" dropped, I must have missed it.","The indie-funk duo of RJD2 and Aaron Livingston offer the best piece of evidence so far to justify RJD2 Mk.

Aabenbaringen Over Aaskammen,Casiokids,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b197b1335d7bf169a2d9/1:1/w_160/65b2182e.jpeg,2011-10-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15934-aabenbaringen-over-aaskammen/,Polyvinyl,"The breezy yet meticulous music of Norway's Casiokids sneaks up on you. It radiates earnestness and simplicity, which can obscure the fine inner workings. Watery vocal hooks and refrains tug at your ear first, but it's the tiny moving parts and lathed instrumental motifs that really get lodged there. This works out to either a kind of failure for a persona-seeking indie-pop band or a kind of success for an atmospheric dance band, two spheres Casiokids have always seemed slightly adrift between, to intriguing but muddying effect. After a scrappy debut and a singles collection disguised as a sophomore album, you might consider this their first shot at a ""mature"" record-- meaning more lavishly recorded, majestically played, and ambitious in scope. Maturity can be tricky to navigate for bands that have established themselves in the symbolic context of childhood. At this point, Casiokids are a synth-pop band only in the same, broad sense that the Flaming Lips (whose multimedia extravaganzas must have been an influence on their celebratory live show) are a psych-pop band. Big sing-alongs, Western house and disco beats, and squiggly analog synths are important elements of their sound, but no more so than Afro-Caribbean percussion, beatific 1960s pop, swarming funk guitars, and (especially as of Aabenbaeringen Over Aaskammen) gnarled psychedelia that drives the Flaming Lips comparison more firmly home. After about seven years in the game, they're no longer a motley crew of promising upstarts-- they're actually kind of a big deal. Their records are distributed all over the world (Universal in Norway, Polyvinyl in the U.S.) and they were one of four recipients of a million-kroner grant from Norwegian pop gods A-Ha. If they still seem fringe-y here in the States, it may be because the communal pageantry of their live show is an indispensible aspect of their music. Somehow, their loopy mishmash of styles just makes more sense when you're dancing with giant puppets under seizure-inducing lights. So here's the weird thing about Aabenbaringen Over Aaskammen: I like almost every song on it, but they don't add up to an album I love. It's not quite hype enough to be pure party music and lacks the cohesive point of view that fosters a more personal connection with a record. At first I thought Casiokids sounded like a different band on every song, but that wasn't quite right. It's more like the same band trying on different looks, different ideas of what a band that got a million-kroner grant from A-Ha should maybe sound like. Aabenbaringen is actually more all-over-the-place than the singles collection. The stately orchestration of the opening track might make you think you've wandered into the wrong Norwegian record by accident. Lead single ""Det Haster!"" recalls the electro-funk of ""Fot I Hose"", but built from commanding slabs rather than twitchy bursts, indicative of a general deepening and swelling of Casiokids' sound. Meanwhile, ""Dresinen"" sounds like a post-punk Dungen and the very catchy ""Golden Years"" is tropics-kissed indie-pop. No one's saying a band should only make one kind of song, but it takes a strong identity to make eclecticism feel personalized. I hear lots of cool grooves and marvelous texture, but I have trouble connecting them to anything beyond that. Still, a vivid, decorative imagination makes these songs fun to glide along. ""Det Haster!"" begins with a bad-stereo-connection fake-out that will have you jiggling the pin in your speaker jack before it comes roaring into full 3D. The intro of ""London Zoo"", a coasting drums-and-synths haze evocative of Au Revoir Simone, features some of the most lusciously precise pin-pricks of guitar you'll encounter. The arpeggiated synth lead of ""Olympiske Leker"" morphs from voicing to voicing with unruffled ease. But no amount of microscopic detail feels sufficient without forming a bigger picture. This one's fun but kind of blurry, perhaps capturing a band in a moment of transition between anarchic youth and... whatever happens next.","After a scrappy debut and a singles collection, the Norwegian synth-pop group's first shot at a ""mature"" record is lavishly recorded, majestically played, and ambitious in scope.

One Pig,Matthew Herbert,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b190ea9e61561daa67c0/1:1/w_160/2d4b4300.png,2011-10-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15930-matthew-herbert-one-pig/,Accidental,"The last volume in Matthew Herbert's ""One"" trilogy contains the same sonic ruminations on consumerism and mechanization as the previous installments, as well as their mood and tenor. Like One One, a heady singer-songwriter record, there's a hushed creeping intimacy to the thing, and a Zen-like acceptance of overbearing forces, even if it intends to keep on kicking against them. Like One Club, which twisted field recordings from the Frankfurt nightclub Robert Johnson into splayed-apart dance music, thereby ingesting corporatized club culture on its own terms, One Pig is an overwhelming, inscrutably political electronic record culled from an unlikely source. In this case, it consists of manipulated recordings Herbert made of a pig's life, ""from birth to plate."" This certainly isn't the exploitation record PETA assumed it was gonna be, and it's not a slab of musical vegan didacticism that presumably, many more, who prefer their music to be good first, and message-oriented second, feared either. No matter how visceral Herbert's mix of animal grunts and menacing electronics feel, the message is never something simple like, ""it sure is sad that we kill animals."" Rather, it moves listeners to be more mindful of consumption and waste (the pig's parts were even turned into instruments), while acknowledging just how strangely disconnected we are from the animals killed to put food on our table, or say, shoes on our feet. But the lingering feeling on One Pig, the first half in particular, is still one of abject horror. ""September"" (each song is named after the time of year when the sounds contained therein were recorded) begins with stabs of noise that could be from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre score, and then shifts into a slowly molting rhythm, punctuated by horrifying retches from the pig. As the track perversely bounces along, the animal wails become harsher, and Herbert pulls the growl in and out of the mix and you begin to expect, even anticipate them. Its appearance in the mix becomes as viscerally rewarding as a typical pop-song hook. Much of the record intends to freak listeners out, but there are gorgeous moments of pause too, and often those conflicting feelings are contained on the same track, making the message complex and never one-note. ""November"" is a delicate recording of the pig oinking, jaggedly interrupted by telling sounds (knives clanging together, something plopping on a hard surface) and nervous rhythms (gulps of tinny feedback, vibrant drumming), foreshadowing the pig's death, and even suggesting it's oddly cognizant of the end in some way. It's a way to invoke empathy for the creature. But then, the track bounds foreword into an intense damaged dance track, slamming into ""December"" which begins with an ominous metal gate opening. Rarely does a piece of music feel this genuinely temporal-- like anything could happen at any moment. As One Pig moves closer to the end, the songs gain focus and the pig itself is subsumed into the process, not just sampled, but literally creating the music thanks to a strange ""pig blood organ"" and a drum made of pigskin. ""August 2010"" begins with recordings of the pig being cut up and fried, and ends with it being joyously consumed by a room of people. In between is a sea of strange, melodic whines and moans-- like the pig cheaply Auto-Tuned or vocoded. According to this excellent making-of video on The Guardian's website, the sound's generated by that organ, whose sucking rhythms are the result of blood coursing through the instrument. To suggest you cannot enjoy the record would be inaccurate, but Herbert has cleverly designed an album that must be experienced on its own terms. The last track, a touching, voice-and-guitar ode to the pig by Herbert that looks back to One One's simplicity-- and in that sense, provides circularity to the entire trilogy-- makes the pig's absence palpable. Throughout the album, even those most viscerally catchy and hypnotic songs, just as they're almost getting into a conventional groove, are boldly interrupted by the pig, making it impossible to ignore the processes that lead to the record's creation. Imagine if those really sweet leather boots you bought let out a ""moo"" every time you stuck them on your feet and tightened the laces. Herbert notes in the making-of video that, for legal reasons, he could not record the actual death of the pig. And that says a great deal more about government-sanctioned ignorance and the bizarre regulations on food manufacturing than One Pig really ever could. What Herbert has put together is a witty, difficult, touching testament to making something lasting out of one of the world's many cruel inevitabilities.","The final volume of Matthew Herbert's ""One"" trilogy is an overwhelming, inscrutably political electronic record culled from an unlikely source: It consists of manipulated recordings Herbert made of a pig's life ""from birth to plate.""

Awake EP,Trash Talk,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16e9d034d5c69bf4a00/1:1/w_160/8408d9ab.jpg,2011-10-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15911-awake/,True Panther,"Despite their wall of noise, Trash Talk work best in miniature. The Sacramento quartet (and OFF! tourmates) wield such an in-your-personal-space presence and messy, spastic forward push that it can be hard, as a viewer or listener, to give them back the energy they deserve. When watching their shows-- during which they often repurpose bottles, mic stands, and garbage cans as projectiles-- it's thrilling when they unplug, and you're still locked in and protecting your head. The group's 10-song, 17-minute 2010 third album, Eyes & Nines, was good; their new, five-song, nine-minute Awake EP is great. Not all of this has to do with leaving-you-wanting-more brevity: The band, led by playfully (but effectively) violent, wall-climbing vocalist Lee Spielman, are finding more ways to cram hooks and distinctive details into what, in the past, followed a more specific punk template. Here, the guys nail a sort of thrashing pop to the spastic hardcore without loosening the grip around your throat. See, for instance, the opening title track: Starting with solo drumming and then some guitar feedback and double vocal shouts-- Spielman's spastic upper register mixed with a deeper grunt-- ""Awake"" turns into something colossal in under two minutes. The pulse is rollicking, weirdly unhurried (no vocals until 23 seconds in), the whole thing packed tight. And, as usual, the lyrics feel like a call to arms. We get the scene-setting introductory line, ""In the land of nod, he who sleeps with both eyes open is god,"" but it's the chorus-- ""Reflected in conniption fits/ I'm jaundiced, gaunted, sick sick sick/ Awake""-- that establishes a more interesting tone. It's a kind of vintage Maximumrocknroll vibe, with sentiments you might glean from Crimethinc. From the thorny inverted peace symbol on the cover, the disenfranchised lyrical sentiment (see the the smash-shit-up ""Awake"" video), Trash Talk continue to dig into the sort of anger that inspired the recent Occupy Wall Street protests. Though it taps into feelings that have always been there, it feels especially important and of this moment. In the 58-second track ""Slander"" we get: ""Line up and call me names/ Come spit in my face/ It doesn't matter/ I'm in a better place."" In the fantastic closer ""Gimme Death"", we're given a protagonist making the most of destitution: ""Facedown in the gutter/ I've got my ear to the street."" In the breakdown-heavy ""Blind Evolution"", we're told, ""I've got a problem with no solution/ The solution's out of reach,"" and, ""Your revolution's already lost."" Even on this short burst of an EP, Trash Talk are working on a more expansive level. For instance, the last lines of the record-- ""Gimme death""-- resonate as more than a standard punk toss-off after a close listen to fourth track ""Burn Alive"". In two minutes of the latter, there's a Ramones nod (""When I grow up I wanna be sedated""), revolutionary imagery (""Plant the seed and the fury spreads like legs/ Without a light at the end of the tunnel unless they set the whole mountain ablaze""), and this: ""A blind man told me it's better to burn out than to fade away/ I said 'You're missing the point… yeah, the good die young/ But the great survive to burn alive/ The good die young, so burn alive.'"" Trash Talk have been drawing that sort of line in the sand for years-- it's the sort of thing lifers do. Still, in 2011 it's satisfying seeing a higher-profile punk band carrying a torch like this, and unafraid to use it as a weapon.","The Sacramento hardcore quartet is finding more ways to cram hooks and distinctive details into what, in the past, followed a more specific punk template. On this brief but powerful EP, they draw from a well of righteous anger but never forget to keep the music filled with hooks.

Beyond the Lightless Sky,Hull,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18e5e6ef95969322144/1:1/w_160/b826bdff.jpeg,2011-10-13 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15929-beyond-the-lightless-sky/,The End,"Hull don't squander opportunities to make first impressions. Sole Lord, the Brooklyn quintet's 2009 debut, offered a promising extension of the ambitiously psychedelic doom legacies of Neurosis and Isis, simply caked in the residue of stoner metal record collections. Moments of atmospheric drift, mathematical twist, and belligerent march tied together into the suggestion that this was a band to watch. Hull's sprawling follow-up, Beyond the Lightless Sky, appropriately opens with ""Earth From Water"", an 11-minute triumph of that potential and one of the best gambits you're likely to hear all year. ""Earth From Water"" not only synthesizes those earlier qualities-- a pensive instrumental break here, a crusty mid-tempo stomp there-- but adds seemingly conflicting moments of hardcore maul and melodic bursts memorable enough for modern rock radio. What's more, ""Earth From Water"" is deftly built, with impossibly exhilarating moments of lift added at precisely the right moments, whether through a spiraling solo or a bass-thick, full-band roar. No moment is wasted, no idea is idle: This is the longest track in the band's catalog, yet it doesn't seem quite long enough. ""Earth From Water"" serves as a sort of manifesto for the rest of Beyond the Lightless Sky, an unabashed attempt to increase both Hull's scope and scale. While Sole Lord felt mostly like a collection of related tunes, Beyond the Lightless Sky is a deliberate sequence of songs and segues. Hull attempts to replicate the push and pull of ""Earth From Water"" throughout these 57 minutes by splicing an often-meditative instrumental between each pair of roaring, full-band numbers. ""Earth From Water"" exits with the sort of full-spectrum thunder that makes headphones hurtful, and the title track pirouettes open with a serrated guitar line and a restless drum rush. But ""Just a Trace of Early Dawn"", which separates the two, rises slowly from an electronic din into a Six Organs of Admittance-style smoky haze, drums tapping lightly behind a circular acoustic guitar. Like the opener, ""Fire Vein"" and ""False Priest"" both set their aims for triumph, dividing throaty declamations and malevolent moments with distended solos and elaborate bridges for nine minutes at a time. But they're distinct enough not to require ""Wake the Heavens, Reveal the Sun"", the intercalary passage that wraps an interesting sample of primitive chants in needlessly ponderous guitars and drums. Of the four shorter passages meant to bridge the album's five proper songs, only the last one, ""A Light That Shone From Aside the Sea"", stands for greater consideration. Suggesting a more rigorous Pelican indulging in restraint, the brief piece reveals yet another, more nuanced side of Hull-- as the suggested coda falls into a fade-out-- one capable of denying gratification. That quality is consistent with and complementary to Hull's ostensible aim on Beyond the Lightless Sky-- to make a colossal and cohesive statement that moves beyond the bounds of simply being a good rock record. This is, after all, a concept album about two Mayan brothers struggling with their separate and conflicting destinies. But the antiphonal approach between surging, complicated epics and complacent, ruminative tone pieces not only squanders Hull's hard-won momentum, but also renders an album full of misdirection and surprises sometimes indistinguishable from one side to the next. (Over time, a landscape of high hills and beautiful valleys eventually becomes just another landscape.) Still, at their best, Hull join a rare but growing class of bands resurfacing doom with new influences and expectations. Beyond the Lightless Sky doesn't meet recent high-water marks set by the Body, Rwake, Baroness, or Thou, but it does seem like the next stepping-stone for Hull. Two years ago, they proved they had the songs. Now, they've proven they have the ideas, aims, and skills. Given the depth and delivery of the best moments here, it's intimidating to consider how Hull might sound when they get it all right at once.","Hull's sprawling second LP-- a concept album about two Mayan brothers struggling with their separate and conflicting destinies-- is an unabashed attempt to increase the psychedelic Brooklyn sludge metal quintet's scope and scale.

Sets & Lights,Xeno & Oaklander,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1849d034d5c69bf4a22/1:1/w_160/368a9ade.jpeg,2011-10-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15927-sets-and-lights/,Wierd,"Sets & Lights is Brooklyn duo Xeno & Oaklander's third album overall and second for analog-fixated NYC label Wierd. It's also their best release yet, but it it takes some time to sink in. The sounds that X&O (Liz Wendelbo and Sean McBride) make are regularly referred to as ""coldwave""-- deadpan D.I.Y. post-punk filtered through brutal drum machines and synth lines so brittle and thin you could practically snap them over your knee. It's easy music to appreciate but hard to outright love this stuff in large doses (that held even for last year's excellent look at the original coldwave movement from the late 1970s and early 80s, The Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 1). The formal rigidity of Xeno & Oaklander's artistic aims can cause them to blend together at first listen, and since this isn't wide-reaching, crowd-pleasing stuff, it takes some commitment to stick with it. So Sets & Lights is more of the same chilly, dusty electronic gloom, but they've stuck with their aesthetic and gotten better. Compared to 2009's attention-getting Sentinelle, Sets & Lights is full-bodied and lush. Artists who release music on Wierd typically forgo computers"", so the fact that Wendelbo and McBride were able to coax such austere beauty from their machines is impressive in its own right. The highlights seem to take cues from ""Secret Stores"", a blissful track from You Today, McBride's otherwise disappointing solo effort as Martial Canterel from earlier this year. There's more intricacy, more gloriously tangled arpeggios, and a stronger focus overall on melodic composition. That last one is key, as it also Wendelbo and McBride have also developed stronger vocal presences. Wendelbo no longer sounds like she's simply sighing into an amplifier, while McBride's range has expanded and now runs from the gothic sighs on the lovely opening title track to fierce determinism on ""Corrupt"", an aggro headblast of a number that should satisfy fans of the latest Cold Cave album. Sets & Lights is also the first release from Xeno & Oaklander where they reveal that they have a sense of humor-- one of the digital-only bonus tracks is a four-alarm Italo disco assault called ""Italy"". But Sets & Lights, like earlier records, is ultimately a bit too stuffy and self-serious as a whole. Still, while this collection may not be a breakout release, it's good to hear them stepping out and experimenting with new moods and textures.","The Brooklyn coldwave duo's austerely beautiful third LP finds Liz Wendelbo and Sean McBride mastering their deadpan post-punk and showcasing a stronger focus on melodic composition.

The Matrimony Remixes EP,Julianna Barwick,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18c5e6ef95969322141/1:1/w_160/0be97f49.jpeg,2011-10-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15926-the-matrimony-remixes-ep/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Quick question for anyone who's zoned out to Julianna Barwick's gorgeous 2011 album The Magic Place: Did you ever think to yourself, ""This is cool, but I'd love to hear some beats laid on top of these tracks?"" Me neither. But given that this EP is a low-key release being sold on Bandcamp for $5 (and available to stream for free), you can't begrudge Barwick or her label for wanting to extend the life of that album. If nothing else, given the strength of her last record, she deserves a victory lap. One issue with remixing tracks from The Magic Place is that they're hard to pull apart. With their layers of voices, heavy reverb, and instrumental loops, they feel integrated and whole, each part gaining its meaning through its relationship to the others. That's true in all music, of course, but with immersive ambient tracks based on addition and subtraction and so dependent on harmony for musical content, it becomes that much more difficult to isolate one element and build something new out of it. Four remixers here give it a try (the six-song set is rounded out by the album versions of ""Vow"" and ""Prizewinning""). Diplo and Lunice's take on ""Vow"" is, in one sense, the most cookie-cutter version, in that it mostly does what remixes of indie music have been doing since the late 1990s: isolates a small section of the original and adds some programmed drums. By foregrounding an electric keyboard refrain, giving the tune more of a pulse, and adding a 1980s sheen, it actually bridges the gap between Barwick and Enya circa Watermark, but it feels more like an uninspired original track that happens to have some samples from Julianna Barwick than a proper song. Helado Negro's take is more interesting, as it condenses rather than separates, creating a compact loop of highly melodic sound that reminds me of early Four Tet remixes. On top of the loop is an original vocal, presumably from project leader Roberto Carlos Lange, and it has some relationship to the original but doesn't feel bound to it. It's solid, but not something I'm likely to return to. The two remixes of ""Prizewinning"" include the set's high and low points. The duo Alias Pail cut up Barwick's vocals and fold in some tribal drums, and the result feels like an empty exercise. Prince Rama, on the other hand, take the track and amplify it, making it more in every respect-- surging sounds, changed vocals, extra-shimmery production-- and it works surprisingly well, almost brilliantly. To my ears, it's the best thing Prince Rama have ever done, and it winds up feeling like a proper collaboration that has a compelling reason to exist. That's ultimately all you can ask for from a remix, even if it doesn't happen often enough.","This low-key EP features songs from Julianna Barwick's gorgeous 2011 album, The Magic Place, remixed by Diplo and Lunice, Helado Negro, Alias Pail, and Prince Rama.

Original Colors,High Places,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b188c0084474cd0c1e19/1:1/w_160/32c4ccb1.jpeg,2011-10-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15922-original-colors/,Thrill Jockey,"Whimsy's tough. Too much, and you risk damning yourself to frivolity, cutesiness; too little, and you flirt with a potentially stultifying self-seriousness. Brooklyn-to-L.A. junkyard-pop duo High Places managed to keep their whimsy in check on their early EPs and stellar, spectral self-titled LP, matching Mary Pearson's swooping sing-songs to an alluring back-bedroom clang, playfully delivered but painstakingly crafted. Time and again in those early days, High Places perched themselves at the midpoint between experimental, electronic mangling and wide-eyed melodics, then proceeded to double-dutch all over it. Things took a turn toward the serious on last year's High Places vs. Mankind. Adding further wrinkles to their rippling productions while tamping down some of Pearson's vocal buoyancy, it's an intriguing-sounding record full of alluring textures and warped schoolyard chants. Next to what came before it, though, Mankind's melodies could seem soft-pedaled, its hooks wedged into tracks rather than constructed alongside them. And Pearson's oft-unaffected vocals took on a disaffection that felt a bit like detachment, that wonder in her voice oddly absent. This shift-- toward a fuller sound, but away from a lighter spirit-- continues on their third LP, Original Colors. Drawing on a spectrum-spanning array of dance music, Original Colors takes its cues from drum'n'bass, minimal techno, and trance's dalliances with pop. Easily their most danceable, production-centered record to date, Original Colors moves with a quicker pulse than anything that came before it. Pearson and Barber still favor their homespun beatmaking setup, and while there's no mistaking most of High Places' production work with that of the pros, they at times manage a pretty good duct-tape-and-popsicle-stick approximation of Roni Size & Reprazent's earthy clamor and the epic, arid trance-pop of Everything But the Girl beatmaker Ben Watt. Though dance purists will likely find Original Colors' careening too sinewy and scattered, every beat is set just so, and Barber and Pearson's anything-goes confidence lends these tracks an appealing elasticity. Though this shapeshifting sound world proves immersive enough, as a pop record on the order of their warbly, wide-eyed debut, Original Colors maintains a certain distance. Further flatlining her post-Mankind vocal delivery, Pearson deadpans her way through a good chunk of her lines in a distracted, almost drowsy manner. There are stretches where it seems as though she's left the room entirely; she's certainly singing less than ever before, and her vocals are often backgrounded or otherwise processed in a way that diminishes their potential impact. The crumbly, constantly undulating percussion seems to have edged Pearson out of the frame, and apart from a few more-than-milquetoast melodies they manage to set out front, she seems pretty content to let the beats take the lead, a task they're not always up for. The few graspable melodies she gets out front fare quite a bit better; ""Dry Lake"" is comfortingly loopy, if a tad lethargic, while the dubby, EBTG-nodding highlight ""Sonora"" finds Pearson doing a passable Tracey Thorn over its tumbling-downstairs backdrop. These two tracks see Pearson finally exiting her shell, shedding some of the timidity that seems to trail her here, and the beats-- easily Original Colors' most vibrant-- perk up to match. A few songs later, and there's that trepidation again. Original Colors opens up a bit with repeat spins, but its meek melodies never quite bubble to the surface the way you'd hope. Instead, as the beats deepen, their alien textures grow ever-weirder from prolonged exposure; they, too, lack some of the warmth of High Places' earlier work. But Original Colors' production still doesn't quite sit right next to its paucity of melody, and its sidestepping of the song in favor of the sound never feels like a fair trade. The beguiling interplay between the two halves of High Places-- the ethereal, almost cherubic vocals and the clattering racket in, around, and behind them-- is lacking here, along with much of their clubhousey sense of adventure. For a group who traded so well in whimsy, who got off to such a kaleidoscopic start, Original Colors can feel unusually drab.","On their third LP, the Brooklyn-to-L.A. junkyard-pop duo High Places continue their shift toward a fuller sound and away from a lighter spirit.

Biophilia,Björk,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b178ea9e61561daa67a4/1:1/w_160/dda92fdb.jpeg,2011-10-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/,Nonesuch,"The most common caricatures of Björk tend to fixate on her outsized aesthetic sense. But for all the bonkers fashion choices, outré collaborators, and leftfield influences she pulls into her orbit, it's easy to forget that her worldview is also equally informed by a sympathy and awareness of the systems that guide us. From the ""beats and strings"" manifesto that shaped Homogenic to the ""music for laptop speakers"" mandate that drove Vespertine through to the vocals-only absolutism of Medúlla, her obsession with patterns and structure and conceptual boundaries has consistently been at the center of her work. Often, she has celebrated the messiness and the chaos implicit in these very things; in fact, the very first line of her very first single took a perverse delight in the lack of logic inherent in one of the biggest and most complex systems of all: human behavior. Biophilia marks Björk's eighth full-length release, and represents her definitive attempt to create an ecosystem around her work. Billed as her ""most ambitious and interdisciplinary project yet"" and boasting all the usual fixings of a Björk release (dazzling artwork, a Michel Gondry video, vanguard instrumentation, a bizarre list of collaborators), it also comes supported by a corresponding iPad application for each of its 10 tracks, a new website, a series of live shows and ""music workshops"", and a forthcoming 90-minute film documenting its creation. Beyond that, the album itself purports to engage with some pretty momentous themes, with song titles like ""Thunderbolt"", ""Dark Matter"", and ""Cosmogony"" and imagery focusing on time, space, and the natural world. (Note that editor Brandon Stosuy wrote press materials for this release prior to being hired by Pitchfork.) The stakes feel even higher in light of Björk's mottled output over the past decade. Between 2004's well-received but thin-sounding Medúlla and 2007's unfocused and sprawling Volta, Björk has arguably been unable to produce anything definitive since 2001's Vespertine. In its worst moments, Volta painted a picture of an artist whose quality control instincts had been eroded by indulgence. One would be forgiven if news of all the scaffolding around Biophilia sounded up alarm bells: Is this her coming back strong, or piling conceptual materials on top of her music in an effort to give it extra depth? If the songs themselves are any indication, the answer leans more toward the latter. While the promotional and conceptual packaging around Biophilia are as forward-thinking as ever, the sheer quality of Björk's songwriting remains problematic. It feels, once again, as if she's prioritized the superficial aspects of Biophilia's presentation over, well, the music. I can't imagine, for example, how a middle section as dull as ""Dark Matter"" and ""Hollow"" made the cut. Even slightly more realized compositions like the the music box plink of ""Virus"" and the twitching ""Thunderbolt"" are essentially just simple motifs stretched way beyond their limits. Too often, she combats the lack of any real structure or melody by over-singing, or lapsing into one of her familiar and increasingly lazy-sounding house vocal runs.  It too often feels as if Björk's songwriting process is now to sing arbitrarily over top of her collaborators' instrumental tracks rather than structure the music around a melody. Sure, there are highlights. When she does get a tune to sing, she attacks it with almost apologetic gusto. Lead single ""Crystalline"" features one of the album's best hooks, and as a result, one of Björk's best and most focused performances. Elsewhere, the gorgeous ""Cosmogony"" carries a faint hymnal quality and an immediacy that wouldn't sound totally out of place on Vespertine or even Homogenic. With its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk, the uptempo ""Mutual Core"" may be the album's best track overall. Although a big part of the PR story around Biophilia, the apps ultimately feel less than essential to the overall experience. Even after spending significant amounts of time with them, it's easy to separate them mentally from the music. They're well-designed and infused with appropriate amounts of playfulness and mystery, and a few have almost meditative properties that suit the music well, but ultimately they feel like they're there to support a concept rather than vice versa. Beyond that, in costing $1.99 apiece (or just under $10 for the full complement), the app gambit ultimately hits upon another latter-day Björk tendency, which is her seeming willingness to exploit all available revenue streams. Is it fair to fault Biophilia for failing to realize its own ambition? That's a tough question; Björk's curatorial acumen, her visual sense, and her vision are so beyond reproach that it feels almost churlish to complain about something as simple as a lack of melody, or the fact that she's an experimental music pioneer who might just be over-charging for her experimental iPad apps. Nonetheless, for an album ostensibly about the elements, there are some essential pieces missing here. As an innovator, she's as vibrant as ever, but as a songwriter, she sounds tired.","Björk's eighth full-length release may be her most ambitious yet. The nature-themed Biophilia is supported with iPad apps, a series of live shows, and a forthcoming documentary, but sometimes the cross-platform zeal outstrips the songwriting. *

The Sea of Memories,Pallers,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17d9d034d5c69bf4a1b/1:1/w_160/14090a37.jpeg,2011-10-12 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15920-the-sea-of-memories/,Labrador,"Through assorted projects and roles, Johan Angergård of the Legends, Club 8, and Acid House Kings-- not to mention the head of Labrador Records-- has built a cottage industry out of mining fragile, lovely corners of pop's past. His newest endeavor, the synth-pop duo Pallers, has really hit the nail on the head. Joined by longtime friend Henrik Mårtensson, the group's debut album, The Sea of Memories, couldn't be more aptly titled-- these two wistful romantics are drowning in it. Not only is Pallers' music exquisitely beholden to the 1980s, the duo's songs are also lyrically obsessed with gazing backwards. In their melancholic Scandinavian way, Pallers find a way to ache about every kind of reminiscence. They can conjure up an old mistake or missed opportunity and wallow in regret, yet just as easily fixate on a moment of bliss from the past and then mourn the fact that it's gone. Even as a wonderful thing is in the process of happening, the seed of its loss seems to be lurking just beneath the surface. Fortunately, Pallers know the right kind of musical accompaniment to make all of these retrospective bum trips feel beautifully poignant rather than drearily whiny. Taking ample pages from New Order's playbook, the duo sculpts soundscapes that are sufficiently moody to suit their sad-eyed lyrics, yet feature enough insistent beats and squirming synths to maintain a brisk, sometimes even heart-rushing pace. The album's second track, ""Humdrum"", sets this template, wedding nimble synths to plangent guitars, while the whispered lovesick vocals rue the fact that ""You're in my head/ Not my bed."" The congruently titled pair ""Come Rain, Come Sunshine"" and ""Years Go, Days Pass"" maintains this delicately percolating momentum, complete with the sort of terminally sighing lyrics that wonder, ""If we had the chance to do it over again would we let it be?"" or opine, ""Hearts are cold in the rain."" Better still is ""The Kiss"", a naked, lovestruck declaration heralded by the refrain, ""If it wasn't a kiss/ Then I don't know what it was."" Admittedly, the album's moves are exceedingly well-worn, yet like fellow 21st century synth-poppers Junior Boys, Pallers' precise craftsmanship means they're also able to elicit many of the same deeply affecting moods and sensations as their forbears. To their credit, Pallers also hit on a way to diversify their portfolio-- namely by turning over ""Wicked"" to guest vocalist Elise Zalbo. Not only does the song break up the duo's lovely but same-y mooning, it also works as a canny, self-aware rebuke to some of the rehashing and ruminating that precedes it. Bright and lively, ready to embrace the possibilities of what lies ahead, Zalbo forcefully declares, ""I don't care about this pain tonight.""","On their debut LP, the wistfully romantic Swedish synth-pop duo of Johan Angergård (Acid House Kings, Club 8, the Legends) and Henrik Mårtensson are charmingly beholden to the 1980s.

Forever Abomination,Skeletonwitch,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1829d034d5c69bf4a1f/1:1/w_160/1afca81b.png,2011-10-12 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15923-forever-abomination/,Prosthetic,"Skeletonwitch have always been a party band, even if their cover art and song titles tells you otherwise. My first taste of the quintet came in 2006 via their brief, self-released Worship the Witch EP. I didn't know much about the Athens, Ohio, group but enjoyed their mix of classic Bay Area thrash and Norwegian-style black metal-- it came off like Cliff Burton-era Metallica jamming with Immortal. The scruffy production, which matched the era, cemented the mix. What really hooked me, though, were the scorching dual NWOBHM lead guitars-- busy, catchy, and worthy of any number of bad Midwestern Viking jokes. As it happens sometimes, that first taste-- when they were still basically unknown-- was my favorite. Since then, they've played Ozzfest (and Danzig's Blackest of the Black tour), gone through a couple of drummers and bassists, shown up on Metal Swim, tightened their sound, and released three records for the Los Angeles label Prosthetic. All of these albums were good, but nothing struck a chord like Worship the Witch. That is, until this new one, the Matt Hyde-produced Forever Abomination. It's their first album with heavy-hitting drummer Dustin Boltjes, but the core that drew me to the group early on is still intact-- guitarist Scott Hedrick, guitarist Nate Garnette, and Nate's death-growling brother, vocalist Chance Garnette. Under the watchful eye (and in the sweet looking, beer-soaked pool) of Hyde, a Grammy winner who's also worked with Slayer, Hatebreed, No Doubt, Porno For Pyros, and Sum 41, among others, they've managed to regain their early atmospheric density, only on a larger, more stadium-ready scale. It's darker and heavier than the last three, offering an icy, deep ambiance that went missing on the too cleanly layered, brittle post-Worship offerings. Really, Forever is the rare example of a big-name producer actually helping a metal band progress. (Jack Endindo's dialed-back approach didn't quite click with me on 2009's Breathing the Fire.) The 11-song collection opens with a few seconds of pretty acoustic guitars before launching into the rest of ""This Horrifying Force (The Desire to Kill)"", a proper breakneck Skeletonwitch anthem. That quiet moment's brief, but the transition gives a good idea of the spaciousness-- you'll find a deeper bass sound, sturdier drums, more vibrant guitars. They also place the vocals a bit lower in the mix, which works, because in the end, it's those guitars that keep pulling you closer: the hooks on opener ""Cleaver of Soul""; the lighter-lifting notation of ""Rejoice in Misery"" and ""The Infernal Resurrection""; the forward-driving trade-offs on ""Sink Beneath Insanity""; the huge leads on ""Of Ash and Torment"" that manage to be technical, anthemic, and memorable. Outside Amon Amarth, I can't think of another band that does a better job translating classic-leaning metal riffs into sugar-coated pop hooks without sacrificing heaviness or turning a blind eye to the band patches on their jean jackets. Which brings me to the beginning: Chance Garnette's mentioned the evil and despair of Forever's lyrics, and you can pick that up in his performance-- or via titles like ""Shredding Sacred Flesh"" and ""Cleaver of Souls""-- without being able to understand the bulk of what he's saying. But outside of the studio, Skeletonwitch have never done ""mean"" convincingly. If you've read their interviews, you've seen the happy exclamation points. If you've caught them live, you know they're first and foremost a group of Ohio dudes only too happy to smoke your pot and drink your beer. There's nothing wrong with that-- the transparency adds another layer of enjoyability to the tracks and connects them to a long history of pageantry in metal. Basically, this is exciting, skilled, fist-pumping, true-to-life stuff made by good-seeming guys who, in the end, aren't afraid to laugh, goof around, or make fun of themselves. The music feels grounded and blue-collar in that sense, even with Garnette going on about our souls suffering in the fires of hell.","With a little help from Grammy-winning producer Matt Hyde, this Ohio blackened thrash group's latest album is the rare example of a big-name producer actually helping a metal band progress.

Breaks in the Armor,Crooked Fingers,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17cc0084474cd0c1e0a/1:1/w_160/f66ffbed.jpeg,2011-10-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15917-crooked-fingers/,Merge,"Maybe it's his former band's recent return that's got Eric Bachmann ruminating so hard, but the past, and what to do with it, seems of of particular concern to ex-Archers of Loaf frontman Eric Bachmann on Breaks in the Armor, his sixth LP at the helm of Crooked Fingers. From the start, Bachmann's longstanding, personnel-shifting, Americana-imbued second act's traded in a kind of weary reflection, but Breaks in the Armor's brooding gaze mostly seems to be directed backward; at times, Bachmann almost seems to be addressing his younger self. The album finds him channeling hard-fought lessons into 11 remorse-tinged tunes with the weight of the world on their shoulders, the years caught in his battle-scarred throat. Laid down with Pixies' live sound engineer Matt Yelton-- with little other outside assistance beyond backing vocals from frequent Crooked Fingers collaborator Liz Durrett*-- Breaks*' homespun sound is solemn and spacious, opting for subtle coloring and economy of gesture. Breaks places the spotlight squarely on Bachmann's voice as it wearily recounts a series of past indignities; ""the ghosts,"" as he puts it on opener ""Typhoon"", ""of all your old forgotten lows."" Bachmann's feeling more than a little low on Breaks in the Armor, and he wants you to know it. On lines like, ""I draw the same bad blood out of you,"" from the piercing ""Bad Blood"", he seems to want you to share in it, too. Easy enough. You don't need to hear Bachmann sigh his way through highlight ""Heavy Hours"" to know he's been through plenty of them himself; his rich, roughshod voice suggests as much on every line. With a master's restraint, he imparts an almost apocalyptic dread to the ominous refrain of ""Black Candles"", a dead-serious desperation on the searching ""Went to the City"", a real finality to fare-thee-well ""The Hatchet"". Breaks' lyrical thumbnails of lost opportunities and forgotten friends can seem a touch too pathos-addled on paper, but drawn through Bachmann's lungs, they leave their mark. While a few hints of light eke through Breaks' dark surface, it's a somber affair, and Bachmann's dour outlook can sometimes drag his melodies down with him; as much weight as his voice can carry on its own, a few of these tunes dial the music back so far that you're left with little else but ache. But even when Bachmann lays things out too bare, he'll slip scores of feeling into a line or two, leaving the listener with no doubt as to precisely which nerve he's intending to strike. ""Much too much for us to turn back now,"" the guy who once screamed, ""you've got it all wrong,"" sighs on ""War Horses"", the regret in his voice never far from the surface.","The past, and what to do with it, is of particular concern to ex-Archers of Loaf frontman Eric Bachmann on his sixth Crooked Fingers LP. Much of Breaks in the Armor feels positively wounded-- at times, Bachmann seems to be all but speaking to his younger self.

A Different Kind of Fix,Bombay Bicycle Club,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17a13d197565213a611/1:1/w_160/41985a75.jpeg,2011-10-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15914-a-different-kind-of-fix/,IslandInterscope,"It's incredibly easy to say ""forget everything you know about Bombay Bicycle Club,"" when they really haven't established much of an identity to begin with. But I'll try to sum it up: If you've ever wondered what might happen if Editors were fronted by a freak-folk singer, by all means pick up their debut. Meanwhile, on last year's mostly acoustic soft parade Flaws, they sounded like they'd get their lunch money stolen by Kings of Convenience. I suppose their sales inspired more patience from Island than their art, but on A Different Kind of Fix, they follow in the proud tradition of Snow Patrol's Final Straw and Travis' The Man Who, wherein a band links up with a hotshot producer, ditches a trad-indie sound that just wasn't working, and discovers its destiny churning out soft-serve sweetness that completely neutralizes your critical reasoning skills. I'm fairly certain the same impulse that triggers my desire for an Oreo McFlurry makes me want to listen to A Different Kind of Fix. It's more likely that Bombay Bicycle Club sought out producer Ben H. Allen than the other way around-- after all, BBC have dutifully namedropped Allen clients Animal Collective and Deerhunter as big influences leading up to the release of Fix. Yeah, it's 2011 and just discovering those bands is just another aspect of BBC that seems so easy to make fun of before they totally disarm you: While nothing here will make you say, ""yeah, total 'Summertime Clothes' moment,"" they've opted out of ""quiet is the new loud"" by investing themselves in the elemental songwriting aspects of America's indie elite: repetition is the new chorus, texture is the new volume. And indeed, Apple might need to take a long look at Allen as a product designer if they haven't found a worthy successor for Steve Jobs-- as with Merriweather Post Pavilion, Halcyon Digest, and especially Washed Out's Within and Without, Allen gets a sound that's sleek, bold, and covetable, yet within the price range of the young and upwardly mobile. The easy lilt of Jack Steadman's vocals (thankfully shorn of his prior melismatic fringe) gives Fix enough humanity and extroverted charm to keep it from being a mere showcase for Allen's production tricks, but the depth of the low-end and a prudent amount of abrasive grit imparts a three-dimensionality that saves BBC from getting pushed around like any band that could reasonably be compared to early Coldplay. Sure, the guitars on ""Bad Timing"" are thickly distorted, and the drums get a digital makeover into machinery, but it doesn't exactly rock-- it just asserts itself the right amount where a Steadman solo performance would be content to play the wall. The point of ""Lights Out, Words Gone"" isn't to praise BBC for apparently owning a Talking Heads record, or writing the catchiest Foals song Foals didn't actually write-- it's to lose yourself in the luxurious gulf between the band's vaporous harmonies and the glassy, yacht-funk riffs. The title of ""Shuffle"" might just be an indication of whose ad dollars Fix has in its crosshairs, and it could very well get there. BBC make full use of a stammering piano loop for both melodic and percussive purposes, and Steadman's vocals tumble over handclaps and layered harmonies in a manner that becomes subtly unstoppable instead of mawkish. And Fix is all about accumulative properties, little bits and pieces that add up to way more than it should. ""How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep"" seems genial enough in its first minute-- a blindingly clean guitar riff providing an acoustic sunrise while Steadman somnolently delivers the same line the same way (""Can I wake you up/ Is it late enough"") for nearly the song's entirety before an EQ-tweaked drum break sets things in motion. Frankly, you wonder what something this sparkly and chipper was doing on a Twilight soundtrack, but the sonic color is secondary to BBC and Allen playing off each other's skills in service of a certain kind of emotional ""click"" that's certainly in that franchise's demographic. I can't speak much for the actual biochemical workings, but at its best, Fix strikes that point where, ""oh, they're cute"" hits a groove in your mind and gets looped into total infatuation. After its three and a half minutes run out, not much has changed about ""How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep"" except maybe your way of looking at it. But there's something faintly troubling about A Different Kind of Fix even in light of its success: While the songs are wildly improved, I still can't say there's much of a discernible identity. How much of Bombay Bicycle Club are you actually getting here? Steadman's lyrics and the band's tasteful playing convey, above all else, a kind of utilitarian earnestness endemic to young Brits with acoustics writing about girls and feelings. And you might find some of these hooks creeping up on you when you least expect it-- whistling the melody to ""Lights Out, Words Gone"" while buying groceries, realizing how deeply the riff of ""Your Eyes"" burrowed into your consciousness. But just as easily, it can pass right by you as you're actually listening to it, and the closing piano howler ""Still"" serves notice that they've still got an awkward sweet tooth or two left to extract. And maybe this stands out on account of filling a real void. Prior to the Strokes and the Libertines, this is often what UK guitar bands sounded like-- unabashedly cuddly, a little cloying, and in thrall with even the most rudimentary facets of electronic music. But hell, this is called A Different Kind of Fix and not The Shape of British Rock to Come for a reason: whether you're totally nostalgic for a time when Turin Brakes loomed large or just hoping that the Maccabees and the Vaccines might have a decent album in them at some point, BBC are your pushers.","On their third studio album, Bombay Bicycle Club follow in the tradition of Snow Patrol's Final Straw and Travis' The Man Who: Band links with a hotshot producer (here, Ben Allen), ditches traditional indie sound, churns out soft-serve sweetness.

Wolfroy Goes to Town,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b157ea9e61561daa6776/1:1/w_160/1354f5db.jpeg,2011-10-12 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/,Drag City,"Perhaps the most conventional story Will Oldham has to tell is his own. As a teenager in the late 1980s, he moved from his hometown of Louisville to Hollywood, where he struggled as an actor before eventually landing a small role in John Sayles' Matewan and a larger role in a TV movie about Jessica McClure. Oldham soon defected to music, writing songs first under the Palace set of monikers and later as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. Twenty years later, while he still takes the occasional role, Sayles and McClure represent the poles of his subjects: His songs, often in a skewed country or folk tradition, are full of darkly American oddities and characters trapped down in their own metaphorical wells. Oldham's film career continues to inform his music, as he writes songs as soliloquies and inhabits them the way an actor might perform a dramatic role, transforming dialog and stage direction into something flesh-and-blood, memorable, and moving. He writes in isolation and hires a small cast of backing musicians to help him bring these one-act songs to life. For his latest Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy album, Wolfroy Goes to Town, he's chosen a cast of regulars, including guitarist Emmett Kelly. Most of the Wolfroy troupe, like composer/multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily and Chicago-based singer-songwriter Angel Olsen, have toured with him for a while now, and backed him on many of his most recent records. Together, they give these new songs a soft, casual vibe, and the minimal instrumentation-- mostly acoustic guitars and bass-- evokes a dark, bare stage. Oldham places the hardiest emphasis on vocals-- not just his own, but those of his players. His female duet partners have tended to act as his opposites, the coo of their voices offsetting his weathered creak. But on Wolfroy, Olsen sounds just as odd and ragged as he does. There may be no spark of contrast between them, but there's a spark nonetheless, and she's one of the most grounded female characters on any Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy record. The rest of the band's harmonies are rough and pointedly unrehearsed, barely holding together on ""Black Captain"" and ""Quail and Dumplings"". Rustic, however, does not mean primitive. ""Cows"" ends with a sophisticated vocal roundelay that has more in common with British folk than with its American counterpart. It's a lovely moment-- a spare, hushed, and unexpected coda. Oldham's music is deeply attuned to the past and to the people we imagine inhabited it, yet his actorly approach separates him from the mainstream Americana crowd, who tend to favor a more autobiographical approach, or at least some sense of direct confessionalism. Oldham's songs are only obliquely about himself, and they rarely reveal much about the man singing them. ""As boys, we fucked each other,"" he sings at the beginning of ""New Tibet"". ""As men, we lie and smile."" In other hands, such a line might deliver a shock to interrupt the lull of the music, but Oldham never breaks character. That f-bomb becomes part of the lull, and is not so much sung as ruefully breathed. The song possesses all the ruminative gravity of ""I See a Darkness"" and in tone and character could be interpreted as a sequel. Heroes hold no interest for Oldham, who is much more concerned with the moral tangles of everyday people, like the character in ""Quail and Dumplings"" who promises a bright future of full bellies and no worries. Despite the subject matter, it's almost impossible to read that song strictly as a 2010s recession anthem, although it certainly derives some power from current conditions. Oldham's antiquated diction and sepia-toned details-- ""one day it's going to be quail and dumplings for we""-- removes the song from the present and sets the characters deep in some imagined past. In one sense, it robs the song of any topical gravity, but in another, he allows ""Quail and Dumplings"" to transcend any one era. By this point in his career, Oldham seems to realize that it's difficult for his audience to hear his songs outside of the context of his previous albums and incarnations. So he plays that up on Wolfroy, both by shifting away from the fuller sound of his recent albums, and by subtly alluding to his own characters. By now it's esoteric, but hardly a simple retread of past glories. Instead, that sense of connectedness lends these songs a reassuring familiarity, as though they were new corners of a strange world whose boundaries grow larger and whose scenery grows more inviting with every Oldham release.","Will Oldham shifts away from the fuller sound of his recent albums on this soft, casual collection, but the songwriting-- mostly detailing the moral tangles of everyday people-- still has a reassuring sense of familiarity.

Blue Hour,The Drift,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1769d034d5c69bf4a0f/1:1/w_160/ecf3a721.jpg,2011-10-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15913-blue-hour/,Temporary Residence,"A ghost hovers over instrumental rock outfit the Drift's third proper LP, Blue Hour. After 2008's Memory Drawings, the band reunited with original bassist Trevor Montgomery. But as a band member returned, another was saying goodbye: Jeff Jacobs, who primarily handled horn duties, died of cancer, giving the group his blessing to carry on without him before he passed away. The remaining members of the Drift chose not to replace him, and anyone with a working knowledge of the their back catalog thus far would understand why. He was far from just a brass sideman; the successes of Memory Drawings and 2005's debut LP Noumena were a result of not only the band's spacious dub-inflected sound at the time, but also the splashes of color that Jacobs' horn work lent to it. His wide emotional vocabulary allowed his contributions to range far outside the Drift's loosely drawn lines. Jacobs was an integral key to that sound and they seem to be going for something different on Blue Hour. Save for a few delay-treated guitar lines on ""Continuum"", there's little trace of dub on the album, but what they're moving toward stylistically is less clear. The mood on Blue Hour is often understandably tense, with Montgomery's low rumbles (as well as Rich Douthit's rolling, punctuated percussion) throwing stones against guitarist/keyboardist Danny Grody's aquatic ripples. The album's opening cut, ""Dark Passage"", remains engaging as its negative space is filled and, subsequently, drained with dread, but its lack of an emotional payoff makes for something of an unfulfilled finish. That sense of building toward nothing runs through Blue Hour, where inertia takes the form of soft-loud climbing (the 12-minute centerpiece ""The Skull Hand Smiles/May You Fare Well"") and ominous, out-of-place ""Peter Gunn""-isms (early leak ""Horizon""). The band's gift for melodic interplay is in limited supply here, so when some light finally shines in with the sad sways of ""Hello From Everywhere"", the effect is that of windows being opened in a room filled with humid air. On one hand, Blue Hour is a disappointment, especially coming off of an album as strong and promising as Memory Drawings. But the loss of a bandmate has been enough to stop other groups in their tracks. So another way to look at Blue Hour is as a document of survival, a record whose very existence shows the group's courage. It's impossible not to admire the Drift for doing anything other than packing it in.","The Drift's third album finds the San Francisco instrumental rock quartet mining new territory, moving away from spacious dub and emphasizing thicker sounds and tension.

Swimming Through Sunlight,Total Babes,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1759d034d5c69bf4a0c/1:1/w_160/7fa089ad.jpeg,2011-10-11 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15912-total-babes-swimming-through-sunlight/,Old Flame,"Medina, Ohio's Total Babes recorded Swimming Through Sunlight in a garage. It's a fitting place of origin considering their debut, 30 minutes of hook-y punk songs, hits a number of garage-rock beats: Their aesthetic offers Wavves-colored juvenility, their sound an in-the-red fuzz with a subtle pop sensibility and vocals delivered with a bratty abandon. Despite the shimmering album title, dinosaur-and-ice cream cover art, and bratty delivery, though, Swimming's a darker album than you might expect. Most of the 30 minutes consist of fast, jovial-sounding power chords, yes, but beneath the fuzz is a series of songs that builds a narrative about deteriorating love. It begins innocently enough with a series of drum crashes and a tossed-off line,""My thoughts just turn to you/ Just like they always do."" Soon enough, things get heavier, from the semi-desperate promises of ""Be So True"" to the post-breakup of ""Someone to Blame"". It culminates in ""Without Your Heart"", a track that uses the vocals, tone, and hook of a 1950s teardrops ballad. It's the most clear-eyed and clean sounding song on the record. The group is commonly cited as a Cloud Nothings side project, and while there are connections between the two Cleveland-area garage bands, that's not exactly the case. Cloud Nothings is primarily the project of Dylan Baldi, so although Jayson Gerycz has played drums on one or two singles, this is his first time recording as a multi-instrumentalist, let alone as a songwriter. Some of that inexperience shows. Taken separately, the songs are driving punk gems; as a whole, they rarely offer a change of pace. The material is repetitive (down to the same general vocal patterns), each song bleeding into the next. The lyrics of each track push the story forward, but even that becomes difficult to parse past the samey delivery. Only the 50s vibe of ""Without Your Heart"" and the jangling, echoing closer ""Tip of My Tongue"" offer a rest. That said, the semi-aggressive tone can serve as an ear-catching counterbalance to the emotional outpouring: ""Don't Have to Run"" leads with a vicious, rolling drum crash while asking, ""How will I go on without you?""; ""Rot Away"" features a more upbeat hook than the title suggests, though Brown does yell, ""I'll rot away inside your gaze,"" in the chorus. Catharsis is good, but slathering a variety of emotions with such consistently muffled vocals and guitar distortion cheapens their point. By the halfway mark, Swimming Through Sunlight starts sounding less like a garage-rock band and more like some kid howling about frustrated heartbreak in his parent's garage.","The Cloud Nothings-associated Ohio group offers 30 minutes of hook-y punk songs that, despite the jokey band name and cover art, spin a narrative about deteriorating love.

Abzu,Absu,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1795e6ef9596932212a/1:1/w_160/7347fdf1.jpeg,2011-10-11 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15916-abzu/,Candlelight,"In this moment of added indie rock consonants, dropped vowels, and coy spellings, you might mistake Abzu-- the title of the latest onslaught from the long-roaring Texas black metallurgists Absu-- as a dull joke. And for the first 15 seconds of album opener ""Earth Ripper"", when the trio erupts with the sort of squeal and devilish rock beat that suggest the bridge of Van Halen's ""Hot for Teacher"", you might even believe it's true. But neither Absu nor the albums they make allow much room for levity. Rather, Abzu is the second part of a planned trilogy that began with 2009's Absu, the band's first album in eight years and an ambitious, relentless meld that acknowledged and then blasted beyond most every metal covenant. The trilogy is due to end with Apsu, yet another spelling of the several dwellings associated with Enki, the Sumerian god at the center of Absu's saga. But Abzu doesn't need to be funny to be fun. With 36 minutes of stylistic ricochets, speed-metal slingshots, and momentum oxbows, that's exactly what it is-- breathless, focused, and fun. Absu have long operated under a central slogan: ""Absu arrogantly executes mythological occult metal."" It's a sign of how self-serious and topically obsessive they've always been. Drummer, principal songwriter, and singer Proscriptor has never been reluctant to talk about the band's backstory or intentions, either, treating his own art with the sort of historical exactitude scholars reserve for the ancient mythologies he in turn renders as albums. In an early interview, he diligently explained, ""After the immaculate indulgence in the Necronomicon, Voudon Gnostics, Thoth Magick, and Sumerian/Mesopotamian mythology, the name was altered to Absu, in reference to 'abyss' or even the 'blackened Earth.'"" With Abzu, he takes the next step, providing a detailed historical, theological, and personal synopsis of each song in the liner notes. Lyrically, after all, Absu songs are intricate webs of first references, context-less backstories, and shouted spells. It's multivalent stuff. ""Skrying in the Spirit Vision"" lasts only four minutes, but digging into its themes and allusions-- ""Travelling: the Radix of vibration/ Projections: in gale of the Ninth,"" reads half of one verse-- means pausing the song every other second to research another term or concept. Proscriptor's explanations are similarly dense with mathematical equations, ""teachings of Enochian Magic(k),"" and expositions on already elaborate theories. His own simplifications require either a highly functioning knowledge of Mesopotamian mythology or an inordinate amount of patience. All that likely (and deservedly?) sounds pretentious, or at least like a lot just to enjoy some heavy metal. But Absu's unwavering subservience to their ideals is part and parcel of what makes Abzu so enjoyable. For Proscriptor, this is the equivalent of liturgical music, meant to be played with the kinds of energy and enthusiasm that the complete belief in any system or story can create. These esoteric and involved histories compel Absu to incredible conviction and resolve. They twist through intricate structures-- first verses reused as the coda, repeated bridges, impromptu acoustic impasses-- in four-minutes bursts. Occult or no, they move with a Pentecostal spirit. The band's big return, 2009's Absu, was a guest-heavy, 13-track, hour-long sprawl of ideas, a perfect reprise after such a long hiatus. Abzu keeps the crew tight, though, with new guitarist Vis Crom and bassist and vocalist Ezezu only joining Proscriptor and Mayhem's Rune Eriksen, the former Mayhem guitarist whose kinetic leads also lined moments of Absu. Part two misses some of the adventurism of its predecessor, but it makes the most of its concision, packing a lot of parts into convincing little packages. Again, they've got motivation: As Proscriptor writes: ""Ontologically, It Became Time & Space"" concerns the origins of those two crucial concepts, ""or the relationship between metaphysical nihilism and the 'physical' origin of one abstract occult concept."" What's crucial for the listener, though, is that this debate is the basis for a perfectly restless roar-- an irrascible string of swells, collapses, blast beats, pauses, downshifts, and sprints. The complicated subject material matters only insofar as it makes the music compelling. Absu have been exploring various belief systems on tape for the better part of two decades, but knowing the difference between Enki and Ea isn't essential for enjoyment. It's once again only the catalyst for an end product that works well as a piece of music-- and maybe mythology, too.","The latest onslaught from this long-running Texas ""mythological occult metal"" trio is the second part of a planned trilogy that began with 2009's Absu, the band's first album in eight years. Occult or no, they move with a Pentecostal spirit.

Drive OST,Various Artists,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b171ea9e61561daa6799/1:1/w_160/bc2204c8.jpeg,2011-10-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/,Lakeshore,"A few weeks ago, the film Drive opened to wide release. Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, it's a pulpy story about a stoic wheelman (Ryan Gosling) who digs himself even deeper into the Los Angeles criminal underworld on behalf of a woman and her son. Drive is a genre film, heavy on style and short on dialog, complete with finger-shuttering spurts of violence and, despite being set in the present, a pointed focus on retro-cool and classic car films. The Monday morning after Drive's opening weekend, the soundtrack-- anchored by a few unknown but choice 1980s-indebted synth-pop songs and a score by Cliff Martinez (Steven Soderbergh's go-to guy)-- went to number four on the iTunes music charts, its success credited to good word-of-mouth thanks to Twitter. If you've seen the film, it makes sense: The Drive soundtrack pops with just as much neon camp and sex as the lipstick-scrawled opening credits. Effective and memorable soundtracks need to either introduce you to new music that works on its own or transport you into the world of the film. Drive manages to do both, mostly thanks to the five songs that come early in the album, preceding Martinez's score. Director Nicolas Winding Refn (known for ambitious indies Bronson and Valhalla Rising) pre-selected these tunes before the score was written. Most of them catalog key moments in the film and are-- for the sake of getting this thing on folks' radars-- the real draw. These songs follow such a similar format, you could almost mistake them for the work of a single band. All have hyper-literal lyrics, dry-pulsing beats, and subdued, comely female vocals. Sounding like a more sinister second coming of the Human League is opener ""Nightcall"" from French electronic artist Kavinsky, featuring vocals from CSS's Lovefoxxx. ""I want to drive you through the night down the hills/ I will tell you something you don't want to hear,"" purrs an almost demoniacally mechanized voice, and it's hard not to imagine yourself double-clutching it down Mulholland. Lovefoxxx's tender counter, ""There's something inside you, it's hard to explain,"" feels like a perfect encapsulation of the film's juxtaposing moments of benevolence and brutality. Glass Candy's Johnny Jewel gets his hands on two tracks here, with his Desire and Chromatics projects, respectively. However, Jewel could've played a larger part: In a recent interview with Box Office Magazine, he revealed being approached by both Refn and Gosling to score the film (Glass Candy's ""Digital Versicolor"" plays a big part in Bronson), but wires were crossed, and, despite having finished ""the whole score,"" conflicting interests left Martinez with the job. It's hard not to speculate what Jewel's music could have brought to the film but Martinez's muted yet deft approach makes it hard to imagine anyone else smearing such wonderfully subtle hues across the screen. On the album's second half, Martinez's score works like a patient, engaging ambient record with a dramatic arc that works independently of the film. Keyboards plink back and forth like turn signals and human heartbeats, with atmospheres that hang in the air like ghosted taillight streaks. As things get grittier onscreen, so does the music, with industrial grindings and craggy booms slowly working their way into the mix. It's long-- 50 minutes to be exact-- and obviously not the selling point, but where other soundtracks weave bits of score around the proper songs, Martinez's vision, while challenging, smartly gets its fair shake being presented as a whole. By far the most notable thing about the Drive soundtrack is ""A Real Hero"", a collaboration between French producer College and Toronto duo Electric Youth, both of whose phones are no doubt ringing off the hook. Working as a theme and mantra for Gosling's Driver, it's a shimmering, deeply romantic track that, thanks to its repeated use in the film, sticks in your head. ""Try getting behind the wheel without hearing that 'Real Hero' song,"" a friend mentioned to me after I saw the film. Luckily, I had a four-hour slog ahead of me the next day, and while a clogged New Jersey Turnpike at noon is about as far away from a driving experience as the blinking sprawl of Los Angeles at 3 a.m., I couldn't help but feel the stitching from a phantom, scorpion-emblazoned satin jacket itching at my back.","This film's soundtrack features contributions from Johnny Jewel projects including Chromatics and a score by Steven Soderbergh's go-to composer Cliff Martinez. All told, it has as much neon camp and sex as the film itself.

If that made you check in for the first time in years, I'll translate: it's his first record that kinda sounds like Heartbreaker. Though his artistic daring over the past decade has been greatly exaggerated, this is truly a bold move for Adams. He can no longer claim to be a victim, whether it's a victim of an untamed creative streak, substances, tone-deaf record execs, or critics who have the nerve to judge him in light of his earlier work. You didn't have to hear ""Come Pick Me Up"" or ""Houses on the Hill"" first to see 29, Love Is Hell, Rock N Roll, or Easy Tiger as proof that prolific, self-destructive artists don't always make very interesting music. Above all else, there's the romantic ideal that he's a victim of himself, an implosive genius that could make Heartbreaker II if only his pride would let him belly up to the bar with his ""abundance of inherited sadness"" again and let the inevitably gorgeous and truthful songs simply take care of themselves. So, yes, Ashes & Fire is Adams getting on his ""I have no act"" act. And while these boundaries help make it more effortless and enjoyable than his prior works of dilettantism, the strict adherence to a platonic ideal of a Rootsy Ryan Adams Album can't help but make it feel every bit as limited, a snapshot of him as an artist rather than a full portrait. While Ashes & Fire is somewhat one-dimensional, it at least picks one of his better dimensions. Above all else, it's a showcase for Adams' vocals, and they're uniformly excellent throughout. On the chorus of opener ""Dirty Rain"", he evokes Willie Nelson's jazzy, note-bending approach to C&W, and whether it's the rousing performance on the title track or the no-attack Neil Young tributes on Gold Rush-style folk (""Rocks""), he shows a great deal of range without reverting to his past predilections for smarmy playacting. The equal billing suggested by the title of Ashes & Fire is a misnomer, though: There's more of the former than the latter, so don't expect the first-take intimacy of even his 2005 trilogy. Glyn Johns' production is spare and immaculate, and you can hear every bit of empty space between Adams and the other musicians, as well as the always tasteful organ and keyboard work of Tom Petty sideman Benmont Tench. But you can also hear that Johns has some very expensive microphones: it's a warm recording, but one that still has a glossy coating that never allows it to, well, catch fire. It does smolder a bit midway through with the modestly anthemic ""Do I Wait"" and ""Invisible Riverside"", which dabbles in psychedelic blues and establishes a lyrical link to ""Dirty Rain"" that gives the record a bit of conceptual heft. But immediately thereafter, ""Chains of Love"" gets a little too deep into the cushiony adult-contemporary of Easy Tiger and while it mostly evokes his own ""Firecracker"", it nicks the Erasure melody just enough to be kind of a distraction. The aspect of ""ashes"" also designates this as a record obsessed with aftermath, searching for truth and permanence within the wreckage of the past. Though it lacks for autobiographical detail, it's easy enough to fill in the blanks when Adams gravely intones ""I'm just looking through the rubble/ Trying to find out who we were"" on ""Dirty Rain"", or more pointedly on first single ""Lucky Now"", ""am I really who I was?"" And Adams' lyrics are every bit as based in the elemental: shadows, stones, rivers, and way more rain than should be allowed for a record made in Los Angeles. And yet, Ashes & Fire's mixed and muddled use of big symbols too often result in ballads of big nothing. A literally rendered song called ""I Love You But I Don't Know What to Say"" should be a self-deprecating epigram to an album that sounds like it's got so much truth to share, but here it's an M.O. It's actually more of a political work than his Love Is Hell laugher ""Political Scientist"" in how it asserts that saying all the right things in light of a public admonishment is to say nothing that can be held against you. While the subtly devastating line, ""and the night will break your heart but only if you're lucky now,"" appears to welcome the ability to acknowledge and appreciate pain in light of his well-documented battles with Ménièr's Disease and alcohol, elsewhere he invokes what he sang on Whiskeytown's ""Sit and Listen to the Rain"": ""used to feel so much, now I just feel numb."" And it's not even the sort of impressionism he tried on 29 or Love Is Hell to feign depth. Given the right emotional context, the tremble of Adams' voice and words can level easy marks-- upon hearing the distorted guitars slowly bloom during the bridge of ""Do I Wait"", I was anticipating a returned text message that arrived a half hour later, and during the span of those three minutes, Adams could make it feel like the onset of an incapacitating loneliness. Problem is, after a couple of spins wash out Adams' vocal color, you're left with the almost Zen-like emptiness and portent of would-be truisms like, ""Everything you are to me is bigger than the spaces/ Between us and the chains of love."" As a singer, he does what he can to redeem ""Save Me"" and ""Come Home"", which are every bit as trite as their titles would suggest. But while the emotions are too legibly rendered to be completely unaffecting, Adams' words fail him. I won't begrudge a man his feelings, but is the central architecture metaphor (""you built those walls to keep your fears inside"") the best he can do? While discussing Ashes & Fire with a friend, the question was raised as to what sort of reception the record would merit had it come from any number of acoustic-toting songwriters who didn't happen to be the former lead singer of Whiskeytown. That's up for debate, but the bigger problem is that Ashes & Fire could have come from the likes of Matt Nathanson or Matthew Mayfield were it not for Adams' voice. While Heartbreaker is legendary as a drinking partner, calling it merely a break-up album doesn't do it justice. Adams could be funny, he could rock, he could be bitter, he could do that all in the span of one song, while Ashes & Fire is steeped in a sober contentment that feels limiting even though it shouldn't. Adams evokes the goodwill of his masterpiece as a singer, anyway, even if the songwriting doesn't come close. Rather than equal Heartbreaker, here he might have accomplished something more difficult: making it somehow seem underrated.","The early buzz on Ashes & Fire said that this was Ryan Adams' best record since Heartbreaker. Translation: It's his first record that kind of sounds like Heartbreaker.

You Drive Me to Plastic,Bullion,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16113d197565213a5f2/1:1/w_160/068ad5e7.jpeg,2011-10-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15896-bullion-you-drive-me-to-plastic/,Young Turks,"Being a fan of Bullion can be frustrating. The West London producer-- real name Nathan Jenkins-- first caught a fire in 2007 with Pet Sounds: In the Key of Dee, a surprisingly deft, quasi-mash-up record that married snatches of the Beach Boys' classic LP with a variety of J Dilla samples. Roughly four years, an EP, and a handful of singles later, and an honest-to-goodness Bullion full-length still hasn't fallen into our laps. This brings us to You Drive Me to Plastic, which saw release on Young Turks at the tail end of last year as a one-sided 12"". The 500 copies went fast, and while it was made available overseas on CD this past April, it's only now available stateside. While it might be the second closest thing he's ever done to making an album proper, You Drive Me to Plastic is, in fact, not the debut we've been waiting out for. Billed as a ""non-LP,"" the piece's nine tracks blend into one another to create a 20-minute extended mix, highlighting Bullion's genre-smashing groovers that continue to prove just as idiosyncratic and danceable as past efforts. Using shorter, less movement-minded pieces to glue together three big, single-friendly tracks and a more ambitious finale, Plastic most certainly doesn't feel like a debut, but it also doesn't seem like just another keeping-busy-mix-of-the-month either. Whether the whole ""non-LP"" tag sounds like a bunch of nonsense to you or not, a little more Bullion in any capacity is a good thing. One of Bullion's greatest assets is being able to work with so many different ideas and styles while being overwhelming, and the way Plastic is structured is perhaps even more of a testament to this ability. Each of those interludes provide a specific purpose, linking the more memorable moments to create an even more fluid experience. And while stuff like ""Lol Express"" can get by on its own merits, sounding something like M83 crashing into a 1980s cop-show theme, the real pull are the more fully realized songs that will inevitably end up in a ""Best Of"" folder along with his more pop-oriented assemblages. Everything from wandering saxophones, strange vocal clippings, chic club pulsings, and a variety of geographically varied rhythms coexist together while rarely sounding jumbled or too mazy. It shows that, for a guy who isn't terribly prolific, his attention to pacing and matching incompatible sources with finesse often results in success. Bullion has often oriented himself using hip-hop-- he's the same guy that could thrown Klaus Nomi and Buffy Sainte-Marie on a track and still have it sound like an Afrika Bambaataa record-- but Plastic finds him exploring the dancefloors of Europe and the Carribbean. ""Magic Was Ruler"", which again features a Sainte-Marie sample (""God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot""), feels as if you could salsa to it, with a bright guitar line and horns that are evocative of a night out in Havana, while ""Pressure to Dance"" splits the different between slinky Italo-disco moves and Kraftwerk. There was always a sort of deranged quality to Bullion's sound as well-- maybe it has something to do with the fact that his music has always had a joyous, almost spritely disposition, but often contained imperfect samples and darker tinkerings that could readily translate as feelings of unease. A good many of these 20 minutes explore even more haunted extremes. ""Too Right"", which features a pulsing Laurie Anderson vocal sample, is one of the more menacing things he's ever produced. Plastic might not contain your favorite Bullion moments (some of the shorter tracks feel a bit lost), but they're important in the sense that he can feel comfortable exploring certain extremes of his personality without compromising the sound he's been sculpting over the past few years.","Since coming on the scene in 2007, genre-smashing West London producer Nathan Jenkins still hasn't released a proper full-length.

Coracle,Walls,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b169b1335d7bf169a29a/1:1/w_160/d382e814.jpeg,2011-10-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15901-coracle/,Kompakt,"Walls' eponymous 2010 debut album was praised for applying lo-fi pop structures to the kind of slo-mo beats that aligned them with their peers on Kompakt. The duo of Alessio Natalizia (Banjo or Freakout) and Sam Willis (Allez-Allez) have built on those promising beginnings by stretching Walls' sound on Coracle, principally by scraping away all the fuzz and upping the production values. Tracks like ""Burnt Sienna"" and ""Soft Cover People"" from the band's debut album flirted with the kind of filmy arrangements that chillwave was founded on, although their disposition toward harder dance music took them far enough away from the genre to escape too many comparisons. Still, it's hard not to feel that the tightening up of their sound on Coracle is a deliberate cutting of the chillwave tether, even though it's a change that feels natural and has forced the duo into functioning in brighter spaces. One point of interest from that debut record was Walls' propensity for taking Krautrock influences and shaving them down into bite-size chunks; the entire record stopped short at just over 29 minutes. Here, they take the more obvious route and expand those inclinations out and latch them to the sunnier beats that are now firmly within their domain. There is more focus on producing complete songs and less deviation into abstraction here than before, although there are a few welcome moments (""Vacant"", ""Drunken Galleon"") when their fondness for ambient shines through. As such, Coracle is stylistically all over the map, with the pair behind Walls indulging vastly different parts of their personalities through the mostly instrumental tracks. At the center of the album is ""Sunporch"", a strapping electro-pop number built around a skeletal Giorgio Moroder throb and pitch-shifted vocal screams. It's telling that Walls are touring with Battles to promote this album, as ""Sunporch"" is their ""Atlas"", a great utopian future-pop moment that demonstrates the power to startle that this band occasionally possesses. But whereas ""Atlas"" felt like a genuine bolt from the blue, ""Sunporch"" is more of a distant cousin to it, playing out in an alternate reality where Battles have set down a blueprint for all manner of forward-thinking acts. Despite those misgivings it's definitely a step in the right direction, and it's almost equaled in the pretty ""Raw Umber/Twilight"", which combines Walls' love of setting forlorn shoegazer-y patterns to the grind of old analog bass synths. There's a sharp contrast between the twin peaks of Coracle and the rest of its material, especially when they try to pointlessly channel Spacemen 3 circa ""Honey"" and shackle that sound to some perfunctory beats on ""Ecstatic Truth"". It highlights a danger when groups try to veer too far into eclecticism, where the overall focus of the band is lost amid the desire to keep playing around with the sound. There's little in the way of identity to cling onto, with no shared tropes to bind the sound together, making this feel more like a compilation than a focused work by one act. It demonstrates how big the band's record collections are, and how skilled they are at bringing those influences into their sound, but it leaves the question of who Walls are and what they are trying to achieve frustratingly open.","The eclectic Kompakt pop duo of Banjo or Freakout's Alessio Natalizia and Allez-Allez's Sam Willis scrapes away the fuzz of its debut, focusing on complete songs with less deviation into abstraction.

On the Water,Future Islands,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1685e6ef9596932210e/1:1/w_160/ac2fcf52.jpeg,2011-10-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15903-future-islands-on-the-water/,Thrill Jockey,"Samuel T. Herring, lyricist and lion-throated singer of Baltimore synth-romantics Future Islands, has written a lot of break-up songs. He penned some pretty vitriolic ones on the band's 2008 debut, Wave Like Home, and then he wrote an entire record's worth on their terrific 2010 release, In Evening Air. About four songs into their latest-- which contains such boldfaced melodrama as ""I loved you and I still do""-- you get the idea that this guy might be something of a Sisyphus, relieved at last of the whole boulder-up-the-hill business but doomed to sit on the receiving end of an ""It's not you, it's me"" conversation ad infinitum. Future Islands initially came out of Baltimore's Wham City scene; their first, rather unexceptional record was built from electro-punk and day-glo squiggles. Over the past few years, though, they've become more aesthetically disciplined. The thing that made In Evening Air such a bruiser was how seriously it took its job as a break-up album: Its gaze was singularly affixed on hurt. Herring's lyrics were simplistic and conversational, yet pointed: ""You couldn't possibly know how much you meant to me,"" ""You hurt me so bad,"" etc. Amidst a steady, drum-machine heartbeat and uncommonly sentient-sounding synths, he repeated these lines-- the banal poetry of relationship-speak-- until they started to sound downright sinister. His refrain on ""Long Flight"" builds from a quietly mounting frenzy into, by song's end, a full blown, grown-man temper tantrum. Listening to the part when he finally breaks evokes the skin-prickling claustrophobia of watching a mild-mannered airplane seatmate start to freak out 30,000 feet above an exit route. Their third and latest LP, On the Water, is more invested in wide-open spaces. The opening (and title) track gives all the elements of the band's sound more leg room: Herring's unhurried vocals, epic, smoldering synths, and the steady churn of a not-too-choppy tide on a sample that begins the song. Recorded in a friend's house in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, overlooking the Pasquotank River, On the Water draws from the imagery and movement of the sea. It's less intent on bringing the drama or the fury than In Evening Air was, but its reflections on aging and memory accumulate into something surprisingly moving. With the songs' energy scaled back, the efforts of the other two band members come to the fore. Gerrit Welmers handles the keyboards and programming, bringing an evocative, setting-sun vibe to slowburners like ""The Great Fire"" (a soulful duet with Jenn Wasner of fellow Marylanders Wye Oak), while William Cashion's guitars have the same low-end lurch of early-New Order riffs. Though treading familiar sonic and thematic waters at the start, On the Water really comes alive midway through, beginning with the mournful ""Where I Found You"" and building to ""Close to None"", the record's most buoyant track. Though some of Herring's more temperate moments make me miss his snarling freakouts of yore, one of On the Water's most striking moments is decidedly minimal: ""Tybee Island"" pairs the sound of crashing waves with a warm synth tone, both of which overpower the presence of their frontman. For most people, Herring's hyper-theatrical vocals are the make-or-break point of Future Islands: He sings every line like Meat Loaf serenading Yorick's skull. It's an acquired taste for sure, one that's much easier to be unequivocally swept up in when you're watching him on stage (doing grand hand gestures, grinning like a maniac, and occasionally slapping himself across the face), but even on the record, Herring's signature affect communicates something about the operatic sadness of life's everyday banalities. ""Tybee Island"" finds him, for once, barely audible. It's a powerful moment to hear a voice usually so big made to sound-- in contrast with the natural world-- so human and small. It's the polar opposite of the tension-building repetitions of In Evening Air: With each utterance of this coda, he seems more and more to loosen his grip on the past.","The Baltimore synth-romantics' third album is invested in wide-open spaces. Though less intent on bringing drama or fury than last year's In Evening Air, its reflections on aging and memory accumulate into something moving.

Dropped Pianos,Tim Hecker,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16bc0084474cd0c1dec/1:1/w_160/75ca3c01.jpeg,2011-10-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15906-dropped-pianos/,Kranky,"When I first read that Tim Hecker made the source material for Ravedeath, 1972, his masterful album from earlier this year, on a pipe organ in an church in Iceland, I figured the album might sound dark and eerie. I pictured Hecker using the setting's natural reverb to reflect what I imagined to be the space's chilly mysteries. I wasn't wrong-- some of that mood is there-- but Ravedeath, 1972 is wider and deeper than that, encompassing a multitude of tones. It's also a big, enveloping work, more interested in quickly surrounding you than in creating dark spaces for you to enter as you choose. It turns out Hecker actually did create some dark spaces for Ravedeath, 1972, but he did so before entering that church. The nine early sketches collected on Dropped Pianos are starker and colder than what ended up on the final album. Heavy reverb and minor-key tones produce lots of negative space-- shadows in which the spirit of the music hides a bit, poking its head around corners rather than looking straight into the camera. The source of these sounds is clear-- a piano on which Hecker is unafraid to bang out bold, dramatic notes. But most of those notes decay into echo right after they are struck. That effect makes the album name apt-- Hecker's piano seems to always be falling from view. Such quick absence is an inversion of the more-present Ravedeath, 1972. In fact, inversion is the prominent theme here: the album's title flips the name of Ravedeath, 1972's opener ""The Piano Drop"", while its cover image is the exact negative of its predecessor's. Of course, the album name also indicates how piano was literally dropped from Hecker's creative process, replaced by the church organ. But what's most interesting about these pieces is their musical inversion, the way they can be as compelling as what they eventually became despite being tonally opposite. They're compelling mostly because they sound intimate. Where Ravedeath, 1972 had a widescreen flavor, these sketches feel personal and individual. You can imagine Hecker sitting alone at a piano spinning simple yarns, rather than at a huge organ generating worlds of sound. Granted, there is a cinematic quality here that can be as moving as anything on Ravedeath, 1972. But where that album is grand enough to soundtrack the space scenes in 2001, this one would better fit the lonely, haunted journeys of Eyes Wide Shut. That analogy might imply that Ravedeath, 1972 is the bigger, better work, and it is. But the value of Dropped Pianos is not just in showing how small ideas can lead to greater ones. It's a strong record on its own, and solid evidence that Tim Hecker's range continues to expand-- even in reverse.","The nine early piano sketches collected on Dropped Pianos are starker and colder than what ended up on Tim Hecker's masterful Ravedeath, 1972.

TKOL RMX 1234567,Radiohead,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b166b1335d7bf169a291/1:1/w_160/a5b667d9.jpeg,2011-10-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15905-tkol-rmx-1234567/,XL,"Radiohead has a reputation for studio perfectionism and have been known to tinker with arrangements for years on tour, but they've rarely delivered an album as obsessive as The King of Limbs. Their most single-minded record, TKOL is an itchy and restless foray into making songs out of almost nothing except whizzing bits of rhythm. Even accounting for the brief dip into balladry toward the end, bands don't generally come up with something this uniformly dense and tense by tweaking over multiple sessions. But as longtime students of Can's Holger Czukay, Radiohead also know that fevered and compulsive-sounding records can be the product of painstaking editing, stitching multiple takes into one bristling rush. Little of the band's careful detail work, or their general sense of passion, makes it onto TKOL RMX 1234567, a listenable but ultimately bloodless collection of remixes of songs from The King of Limbs. Whether intimidated by the thought of reinterpreting a band renowned for experimentation or unsure how to take apart and reassemble the band's tightly-wound recent material, too many of these 19 artists seem content to settle for bland beauty, or simply apply their usual sonic tricks without pushing themselves in the slightest. The highlights are the tracks that take TKOL's joy in rhythm to new places. Acclaimed UK neo-rave producer Lone turns out a typically brilliant take on ""Feral"" that somehow keeps the original percussion pattern intact while recasting it as an early-1990s ambient house record, giving us TKOL RMX's most bizarrely enjoyable image: Radiohead gone to Ibiza. Pearson Sound, the alter-ego of dubstep progenitor and Hessle Audio label head Ramadanman, pulls a fantastic bait-and-switch, opening with an extended drone intro that shifts into a punchy mix of early Detroit techno and jagged jungle breaks. These two, along with a small handful of other acts-- Anstam squeezing drama from just a handful of skeletal drum patterns, SBTRKT recasting Thom Yorke as a forlorn garage diva, Caribou returning to his roots as a left-field beatmaker-- are fearless enough to recreate the feeling of TKOL in a new form. And a few do get by on sheer loveliness alone, like Four Tet spinning ""Separator"" into an old-school IDM lullaby. But a far greater number of these remixes flatten out the complexity of TKOL's grooves in favor of commonplace arrangements. Instead of Radiohead's pinpoint editing, we get generically ""wonky"" takes on house and techno filled with stuttering drums and formless synth goo, whether aggressive like Blawan's take on ""Bloom"" or shoegaze-lite like Nathan Fake doing ""Morning Mr Magpie"". And some of the most touted names fail to deliver the craft we've come to expect from them: On his ""Bloom"" rework, Jamie xx ditches his minimalist gloom-funk for gauzy, forgettable ambience. More ethereal or abstract remixes of such anxious music could have been interesting, but few seem up to the task here, instead doling out placid and perfectly pleasant background noise. For a while, until its complex grooves revealed the songs beneath, I dismissed TKOL as a brave but opaque attempt to remake Radiohead as just individual components in a roiling rhythm machine. In other words, it seemed like the perfect Radiohead album for remixing. Who would better understand that everything-is-rhythm impulse than dance music producers? If anything, wouldn't they take it further, make it wilder, go funkier? The lack of rhythmic invention here could be forgiven if most of TKOL RMX displayed any kind of invention. Failing to match TKOL's peculiar vibe-- aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital detritus, robotically repetitive yet humanly off-kilter, parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of melodic relief -- is one thing. Failing to replace it with anything that similarly rewards listening deeper and harder is quite another.","This 19-song, 2xCD compilation features uneven remixes of songs from The King of Limbs by artists like Caribou, SBTRKT, Jamie xx, and Four Tet.

Ghost People,Martyn,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b163c0084474cd0c1ddc/1:1/w_160/a2675d8c.jpeg,2011-10-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15898-martyn-ghost-people/,Brainfeeder,"Martyn's sound isn't going to be plugged into a YouTube video with a ""lol dubstep"" punchline. KoRn aren't going to ask him for a remix. And he doesn't hang too close to either of the distant poles that James Blake placed between his own indie-friendly ambience and the aggro, wobble-cannon zeitgeist of bass music's more populist and/or frattier impulses. Martyn's 2009 album, Great Lengths, was ideal for dubstep aficionados to turn to when they wanted to explore the genre's extra rhythmic possibilities instead of just fiddling with the volume knob: It traded on gloomy emotional introspection even as the beat drove it into danceable territory, the nuanced buildups of techno and tech house influences either diverting or streamlining 2-step into 4/4. So it's worth noting that emphasizing any real connection to dubstep as most people know it doesn't do Ghost People much of a service. Sure, there's an appearance by Hyperdub's in-house toaster the Spaceape on the sub-two-minute opener ""Love and Machines"", but the mannered cyborg deadpan he injects into his usually resonant, foreboding voice should give you fair warning that this isn't your typical Class of '06 sound. Ghost People is a significant tonal shift, a rhythmic paring-down into less complex sounds that border on UK funky gone throwback traditionalist. And while it often lacks the moodier, polyrhythmic highs of Great Lengths and the character that came with it, Martyn's efforts to make it back through no-nonsense propulsion nearly make up for it. He goes about this to some singleminded, focused ends: between the steam-hissing, clap-driven Detroitisms of ""Masks"" and ""Horror Vacui"", the way the title track's congas-and-hi-hats pulse buffets a spiky tech-house riff, and the way he pits stammering vocal loops against clipped synth stabs and a spine-rolling locomotion in ""Twice As"", there's a lot of comfortable revivalism at work. (And if that's not late-1980s enough for you, check out the pitched-up integration of the spasmodic wah-wah loop that drove Public Enemy's ""Mind Terrorist"" sneaking into the 808-punctuated ""Popgun"".) Wading through a lot of old-school signifiers and contending with the overarching feel of a two-decade retreat takes a bit of effort, but if you opt out of worrying your head over the nostalgic implications, you'll at least find some engagingly slippery beats driving the works. Martyn's said that he's aimed for a sort of Paradise Garage feel to this set of songs, but the sense of uncanny vibe-catching perception and mood manipulation that Larry Levan was legendary at doesn't entirely take here. There's plenty of intensity, some tracks filled with a bit more levity than others, but there's not a ton of immediate personality to this music. And as pastiche goes, its source material is done more justice than the artist's own back catalog-- which isn't a big loss if you care more about dancing than engaging with an artist's continuum of work. And as an extended buildup to the near-nine-minute closer, ""We Are You in the Future"", the first 10 tracks of Ghost People make for a good preparatory exercise. That last track might be the most audacious thing Martyn's pulled off to date, a stirring buildup to everything he's gleaned from a deep engagement with his classic techno and house heritage, all consolidated into one of those rare tracks that actually earns the overused descriptor ""epic."" If this album is Martyn's disengagement with 2-step and its descendents, even if it's only temporary, he's benefited from the breather.","The producer's latest is a significant tonal shift, a rhythmic paring-down into less complex (and complicated) sounds that border on UK funky gone throwback traditionalist.

Tropical 2,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1555e6ef959693220ee/1:1/w_160/4cf776b2.jpeg,2011-10-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15888-tropical-2/,Boy Better Know,"The timing wasn't right for the Boy Better Know collective's first Tropical mix: in 2006, while most grime was trying to erase the distance between itself and hip-hop, dubstep was mired in death-crawl dystopias, bassline had yet to hit popular consciousness, and UK funky hadn't even happened, the world may not have been ready for a collection of feverish girly rave tunes reimagining the space between grime and garage. Emerging from the febrile imaginations of grime artists JME and Skepta, Tropical was messy and ravey, an exhausting sprint through spiraling, Todd Edwards-style vocals and rough-hewn 2-step loops, as if grime's low-bit, high-contrast aesthetic had circled back to swallow early UK garage whole. But its rave was radically dysfunctional, too hysterically unbalanced for ordinary dancing. Instead it seemed a glorious, unrepeatable one-off, a sound whose moment had passed before it could arrive. But the unrepeatable always does repeat, and here we are five years later with Tropical 2. Replacing Skepta with several younger-generation acolytes, JME's belated sequel already feels more at home in the wider world than its predecessor ever did. What's changed in the intervening half-decade is less the Tropical sound (though that has, too) than the sonic constellations into which it re-emerges. Whether in post-dubstep (Zomby, Rustie, the Night Slugs stable), or the undergrounds of funky, grime and bassline, virtually everyone seems to want to make some brand of lurid, hypercolor (let's call it) rave-house, sonic approximations of the fixed grin of partying past your physical limits. As if to underscore this point, Tropical 2 features several tracks from bassline-into-grime unifier DJ Q, whose pretty but disconcerting, stuttering house tunes constitute the tropical sound at its most resolved, their glowering basslines, gauzy synths, and overlapping sighs molded into a disorienting edgelessness even as they stagger, like a room with no corners. Even more pointedly spelling out the Tropical raison d'être, widescreen instrumental grime specialist Royal-T perversely switches to unabashed house for his sole contribution, ""Cool Down"". Like a hyperactive dub of Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"", ""Cool Down"" is the year's greatest dance anthem-in-waiting, an exhilarating victory lap of organ basslines, xylophone riffs, and a quavering Greek chorus of female vocal samples. But with the glorious exceptions of ""Cool Down"" and ""The Stranger"" (unexpected but welcome bustling syncopated garage from Todd Edwards in a startling piece of Back to the Future-style intergenerational meddling), Tropical 2 is mostly less-excitable than its predecessor. Rather than skip relentlessly toward a fluorescent, drugged-up future-world, the mix instead plunges into zones of eerie, beautiful uncertainty. In particular, JME builds on the mysteriousness of his best contributions to the first collection, less laughing-gas rave than alien ballet on a helium-cloud planet. With their delicately stabbing snares and hesitantly strobing cut-up vocals, ""Sandy Beach"" and ""Easy Jet"" almost defy description, existing in a state of zero-gravity paranoid grace-- think the feel, rather than the specific sound, of Super Mario Bros.' underwater levels in the game's rudimentary, mid-1980s incarnation. Throughout, the Tropical celebration of wrongness is retained, but in a manner more creeping and creepy for its near-respectability. Preditah's ""New York"" mis-remembers Skepta's earlier Tropical tunes like jungle misremembered hardcore techno, its jagged, asymmetrical snares and shrill, sliding vocal samples subsiding into jazzy piano chords, and the soothing refrain, ""tell me you need me,"" pushing U.S. garage to the max. What Preditah-- and everyone else here-- recognizes is how mixing in the smooth with the rough simply makes the latter more estranging and disquieting. This music is most exciting at its most morphological: Best of all are the interstitial moments between tracks when one contorted, molten shape deliquesces into another, beats interlocking in strange patterns of the residual and emergent while melting hiccup vocals form impromptu harmonies. It's this sense of being thoroughly of its time and yet out-of-time, on-trend but off-world, that helps make Tropical 2 so much more compelling than the multitude of edgy house/grime/dubstep DJ mixes clogging the internet's arteries. Rather than expose the connections between everything in a vibe-killing process of demystification, the artists on Tropical 2 trace a constellation of perspectives looking awry, a slippery articulation of that sense of (im)possibility in rave that is more than rave and more than dancing: the shapes we throw to constrain the aliens seething under the surfaces of our skin.","Boy Better Know collective's first Tropical mix reimagined the space between grime and garage with feverish rave tunes. Five years later, this eerier sequel feels more at home in the wider world than its predecessor ever did.

WARN-U EP,Ayshay,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16aea9e61561daa6791/1:1/w_160/b6b9fb3c.jpeg,2011-10-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15902-warn-u-ep/,Tri Angle,"If you're interested at all in the intersection of ghostly, leftfield music and beat-oriented pop, then you're probably familiar with Tri Angle. Since launching about a year ago, the boutique label has pretty well dominated this dark, ethereal corner of the indie universe, introducing or helping introduce about a half-dozen of its most intriguing artists (Balam Acab, How to Dress Well, Clams Casino, Holy Other). But if you think you've got Tri Angle pegged at this point, you may be surprised by its latest release, the debut EP from Fatima Al Qadiri, aka Ayshay. A New York-based singer and producer born in Senegal and raised in Kuwait, she makes digitally processed vocal music with an unusual global bent. Al Qadiri is also a journalist and writes DIS magazine's eye-opening Global. Wav column, which is devoted to highlighting obscure international sounds not usually covered by Western music outlets. Her own songs wouldn't be out of place there. Mixing Julianna Barwick-style vocal layering with traditional Islamic songs, she sings mostly in Arabic and builds spare, haunting tracks from her own voice. An airy falsetto in its natural state, her singing is tweaked and stretched, occasionally pitched downward to sound deep and foreboding, and stacked upon itself to create the sensation of some kind of otherworldly group chant. There are no other instruments, no beats, no gestures to pop songwriting of any kind-- it's music that lives in its own realm. As unconventional as it sounds, WARN-U is, generally speaking, an affecting listen. Just hearing Al Qadiri recreate a version of this sacred music (which sounds like prayers, or at least the kind of hymns you might hear in a religious setting) is striking in its own right, and the addition of computerized elements creates an unsettling tension. The songs feel ancient and futuristic at the same time, like there's no identifiable place or time to pin them to. If that was Al Qadiri's artistic aim here, then she's achieved it, but in doing so I think has sacrificed some approachability. While at times beautiful and certainly inventive, WARN-U is somewhat one-note, and it can be difficult to differentiate between the three short original tracks. It's also free-form to the degree that it can sometimes be difficult to engage with. That's where L.A. production duo Nguzunguzu come in, who close things out with a 12-minute ""megamix"" of the EP's original numbers. Also globally minded but considerably more playful, Nguzunguzu are a great remix choice, and they give Ayshay's material a bright, neon makeover, adding in lots of fluttering drums, handclaps, and trunk-rattling bass. This is where WARN-U is most accessible and arguably most enjoyable, since the addition of structure helps bring Al Qadiri's more avant-garde leanings back toward earth. That a key track here comes from an outside source detracts some from the overall impact, but this is still a boundary-pushing work with strong ideas at its core. Whether or not you fall for it will likely come down to taste, but at the very least, WARN-U doesn't sound like anything else.","New York-based singer Fatima Al Qadiri creates spectral versions of traditional Islamic songs. On her debut EP for the Tri Angle label, her voice is layered and tweaked to create an intriguing tension between organic sounds and digital processing.

The Sunday Gift,Blue Daisy,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13dc0084474cd0c1da5/1:1/w_160/6ab906bc.jpg,2011-10-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15877-the-sunday-gift/,Black Acre,"Blue Daisy doesn't do ""light."" The few singles that the London producer has released over the past two years have sounded anything but, with disjointed rhythms rubbing up against queasy tones and deep pockets of echo. Not that his music is joyless-- if you were captivated by 2009's collaborative single with French vocalist LaNote, ""Space Ex"", following the breadcrumbs he's dropped since has been a heady pleasure. But his music is geared toward dark landscapes. Last year's single with vocalist and frequent collaborator Anneka, ""Raindrops"", featured a remix of the title track from Spanish psychedelic house wiz John Talabot; like most Talabot re-works, the remix was outstanding, but it also sounded as if he were forcing his own style on the original's liquid gurgles and irregular beat. Some in the UK beat scene work with difficult, self-set parameters-- Pearson Sound's brittle woodblock accents and Blawan's hard-as-nails acid patterns both immediately come to mind. But Blue Daisy isn't making music you can dance to. ""I don't go clubbing that much... the club thing, it's not timeless,"" he says in the press notes for this release. ""I'm making music for the long run, in 10 years I still want people to be able to listen to it... I'm not down with the idea of fitting in."" Accordingly, The Sunday Gift is about deep listening, with plenty to get lost in and little to soundtrack a night out. There are long stretches of unsettling ambiance, with jarring, harsh textures and sonic mayhem erupting from the album's foundation. The tension is made tighter by elliptical strings and distant vocal samples spouting vaguely threatening political klaxon language and speaking in foreign languages. The guest vocalists-- Anneka, Cinematic Orchestra collaborator Heidi Vogel, UK rapper Hey!Zeus, smoky singer Stac-- are treated less like stars and more like instruments in the mix, slathered in their sonic surroundings. For an electronic album from someone well-versed in beatmaking, the idea of rhythm almost seems secondary. Comparisons to Massive Attack's unimpeachable run in the 1990s come immediately to mind, but The Sunday Gift feels a shade darker. A better comparison would be Tricky's debut, 1995's Maxinquaye, a record that contains its share of blasted dub and hollow-point production. Another quality Maxinquaye and The Sunday Gift share is anger, something in no short supply in the UK lately. The mix of sounds and sensations has a cumulative quality. Some albums work best as front-to-back listening experiences; The Sunday Gift practically demands such attention, flowing in a single-track style that makes skipping around to specific songs feel like walking into a movie in the middle. And the payoff comes in the form of the album's gorgeous closing suite, which includes the woozy house of ""Spinning Channels"". For a producer who made his name with a sporadic series of singles, Blue Daisy knows how to fill a larger canvas.","The full-length debut from this UK producer channels the darkness and depth of 1990s trip-hop antecedents like Massive Attack and Tricky to create a richly immersive sonic world.

Enough Thunder EP,James Blake,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b165b1335d7bf169a28e/1:1/w_160/8b210e53.jpg,2011-10-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15904-enough-thunder-ep/,Universal Republic,"When asked to give his definition of dubstep in an interview last month, James Blake said, ""There's a very broad template, but it largely focuses on a bassline and the intricacies of drum patterns and it has an intense focus on a feeling-- and I think that's a separation from some other dance music."" Ostensibly, the feeling Blake is talking about is that of heady isolation-- the shadowy sensation that Burial perfected with 2007's Untrue and Blake successfully brought into the singer-songwriter realm with this year's self-titled LP. As for the many dubstep artists who rely heavily on computers during gigs, Blake hates them: ""To me, laptops have got no place on a stage,"" he told Pitchfork in March. And when he covers quintessential songwriters like Feist (on his album) or Joni Mitchell (on this EP), he's not trying to render them obsolete as much as join them within the canon of authentic artistes. For all of the futurist conversation surrounding him, James Blake is a bit old-fashioned. When he took on Feist's ""Limit to Your Love"", he infused it with water-rippling sub-bass and epic pauses while retaining its original emotionality. In that way, it was the perfect cover-- he made the track his own while keeping all the key elements of the original. Enough Thunder's remake of Mitchell's 1971 ode ""A Case of You"", recorded live at the BBC, is different. Blake switches Mitchell's guitar for piano, and leaves it at that. There's no bass. No additional production. Unlike his ""Limit to Your Love"", which expanded and beautifully distorted the notion of a ""singer-songwriter,"" the ""A Case of You"" cover contracts the term, revealing Blake's limitations as an artist. Without any of his signature, modern embellishments, Blake's take has the feel of a stiff recital, his vocal undulations ironically sounding less natural without those well-situated sonic accoutrements. The same can be said of the title track, an original piano-and-voice composition. Even though Blake has been slowly unveiling his singing voice over the last two years, these plain and flat tracks sound surprising. Perhaps they shouldn't. In an interview from April of last year, he said, ""Although I'm making this heavy dance music, I sometimes just sit down at the piano and just sing. It's like that's my ultimate calling."" Enough Thunder's remaining four songs are also decidedly low-key, though vastly more engaging. These are dubstep ballads reminiscent of his 2010 EP Klavierwerke, except with his vocals brought to the front of the mix. As with many of Blake's best songs, they're simple, minimal, glacial. And even though it's pretty damn hard to understand a word he's saying, that melancholy core is present. It's conveyed through the elongated guitar feedback and pulsing submarine call of ""Once We All Agree"", or the sound of a record skipping (or is it a hard drive clicking?) that forms the subtle foundation of ""We Might Feel Unsound"", or the dolphin-like vocal whoops of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon on the duo's collaborative track ""Fall Creek Boys Choir"", which is blessed (and kinda cursed) by sounding exactly like what you'd expect a Bon Iver/James Blake track to sound like. Only three-and-a-half minutes into the EP's penultimate track, ""Not Long Now"", do we get anything resembling a beat dropping. For those who adored Blake's heavier, more rhythmic early material, Enough Thunder could easily turn into Not Enough Thunder. But one of the great things about Blake is how he's willing to make a statement: in his uncompromising music, in his candid and thoughtful interviews, or in his choice of titles. Enough Thunder could be self-reflexive since this is easily his quietest release thus far. But it could also indicate a sort of corrective to the abrasive and cartoonish strain of dubstep that has taken grip as of late, especially in America. To Blake, dubstep means something intimate and internal, but to the many fans of acts including Skrillex and Bassnectar-- who use their wobbling bass like hair metal guitarists used solos-- it means something exuberant and euphoric. And while Blake recognizes both feelings, he certainly prefers one over the other. Talking about the faster-louder-stronger evolution of the style, he recently said, ""Those melodic basslines are insultingly simple and aggressive and annoying. That is now a valid genre, but it certainly isn't dubstep. It's turned into something else. That's cool, I'm happy about it. I'm not like, 'As soon as it became mainstream it became rubbish, or whatever.' It's just something different now."" It's a refreshingly mature yet opinionated take from someone who turns 23 this month. Blake is fighting the respectable fight on Enough Thunder, though the EP's totally bass-less tracks show that he needs dubstep as much as dubstep needs him.","Following on his breakthrough full-length debut, Blake returns with a short collection of new songs, a Joni Mitchell cover, and a collaboration with Justin Vernon. The mix of piano ballads and more fully produced tracks shows Blake's strengths and limitations as an artist.

Hall Music,Loney Dear,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15f5e6ef959693220fe/1:1/w_160/9638422d.jpeg,2011-10-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15895-loney-dear-hall-music/,Polyvinyl,"Taking a wide-angle view of the sweeping vistas he's spent years detailing in miniature on his often home-recorded albums, Hall Music-- Swedish softie Emil Svanängen's sixth LP as Loney, Dear-- is his most elaborate work to date. Where there once was little more than voice and guitar and a bit of keyboard, there are church organs and double bass and, at the end of ""Calm Down"", a gorgeous vibraphone solo, all swirling around Svanängen's high, lonesome vocals. Matching an intimacy of sentiment to a grandiosity of sound, the longing in Svanängen's throat seems palpable and piercing, and the rich orchestral arrangements he drapes over these tunes mostly serve to heighten Svanängen's matters of the heart. Hall Music may be Loney, Dear's most sumptuous-sounding record to date; its tender, plainspoken songs are just as humble and heartfelt as anything Svanängen's done. But their unguarded sentiments sometimes shrink under the weight of their ornate arrangements. Opener ""Name"" turns ""I want your name/ I want your name next to mine"" into a mantra of devotion, its music starting small but swelling to match the accumulated emotion. The swarming music heightens Svanängen's lyrics. ""D Major"" starts out plaintive and pretty but slowly builds to a crescendo of Auto-Tune, while ""Loney Blues"" gracefully folds in glimmers of sound as it rolls along, lending the song a depth of feeling its semi-muffled vocals only half-express. Svanängen's long been fond of soft starts building to shimmering squalls, but on past albums, its been a flutter of synths and guitar rather than a tangle of brass and strings. When Hall Music's flutter-by orchestrations run up against one of Svanängen's more heart-rending sentiments, there's a multiplying effect, the high drama of Svanängen's devotionals sent skyward. But as often as they bolster Svanängen's pleas, these arrangements seem to crowd the songs themselves from the frame. Despite Hall Music's expanded instrumental palette, Svanängen's songwriting style essentially hasn't changed much since his last LP, 2009's Dear John. Svanängen still prefers to let a few words say what too many might muddle, doubling and tripling his oft-affected voice to send the central message of his songs straight through the chest cavity. But some of Hall Music's grander instrumentations offer a lot for Svanängen's gentle voice to compete against, and occasionally it's just too much; the brassy ""Largo"" finds Svanängen duking it out with a tuba (and losing), while the slightly sour melody of ""Durmoll"" proves no match for its stabbing strings. This newfound musical nuancé isn't at fault there; it's often the songs themselves, which can't always claim the same sort of depth. There's a track on Hall Music called ""My Heart"", and then, not too many songs later, another called ""Young Hearts"", which should tell you plenty. Love and the like have always been Loney, Dear's favorite subjects, but whether he's devoted or destroyed, the oft-puppydoggish Svanängen frequently falls back on familiar sentiments, leaving the in-between emotions for the music to handle. That, it often does, but even a stirring highlight like ""I Dreamed About You"" does little more than increase the drama behind its titular line over progressively swelling synths, and too often here, Svanängen's sweet nothings come up a little empty. For all the sonic strides Svanängen takes on Hall Music, he sometimes seems stuck singing the same sad song.","Draped in rich orchestral swells, Swedish pop softie Emil Svanängen's sixth Loney, Dear full-length is his most elaborate record to date.

Apokalypsis,Chelsea Wolfe,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15cb1335d7bf169a281/1:1/w_160/8ee3c534.jpeg,2011-10-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15893-chelsea-wolfe-apokalypsis/,Pendu Sound,"The image that Chelsea Wolfe projects dovetails with the general aesthetic put forth by her label, Pendu NYC. Granted, it'd take the tinniest of ears to conflate Wolfe's music with the witch-house stylings of Mater Suspiria Vision or White Ring. Also, while her music is caustic and challenging in its own way, the semi-industrial loop-heavy aTelecine runs laps around Wolfe in that department. Still, the image of her on the cover of Apokalypsis with whited-out eyes, coupled with her fondness for gothic and Greek typefaces, and choice of cover material (particularly her take on Burzum's ""Black Spell of Destruction""), makes her a perfect fit for Pendu's combination of high art/fashion/horror/goth signifiers (particularly of an early-to-mid-1970s, European vintage). The first track on Apokalypsis (""Primal/Carnal"") is a near-perfect apotheosis of this entire ideal, as Wolfe-- underneath a layer of static and fuzz that ages the clip by a good 20 years-- growls and gurgles like a woman literally possessed. Once you move past this horrific introduction, though, Apokalypsis turns out to be a kind of book completely different from what its cover promises. The title of the album refers to the Greek root of the world ""apocalypse,"" the root meaning ""lifting of the veil."" Folks not enamored with the way Apokalypsis was recorded-- an improvement only when compared to Wolfe's first album, The Grime and the Glow-- might feel like the ""lo-fi"" vibe on some of these tracks is one veil too many, but that choice helps as much as it hinders. On ""Mer"", the first proper song on the album, the hazy film lends Wolfe's halting, fragmented thoughts an air of expectant mystery that's bolstered by the song's pensive rhythm. That veneer of mystery is less beneficial on ""Demons"", a straightforward track that's as close to actually sounding like a Sister-era Sonic Youth outtake as anything made in the 21st century. Wolfe's uncanny mimicry of things musically goth-like doesn't end there. She's able to approximate the general pallor and stuttering sample-based rhythms of Dummy-era Portishead (on ""Movie Screen""), makes like a superfan of Zola Jesus' The Spoils (on ""The Wasteland""), apes early PJ Harvey (on the fittingly titled ""Moses""), and even recalls the icy allure and off-kilter harmonies of the Knife (on ""Friedrichshain""). It speaks favorably to Wolfe's abilities that she's able to approximate all these different styles successfully, but these tracks don't say much about who Wolfe actually is. The aforementioned ""Mer"" might take its cues from performers like Harvey or other like-minded singer/songwriters, but those potential influences are more fully integrated with Wolfe's actual voice. The same goes for ""Tracks (Tall Bodies)"", a haunting ballad that features Wolfe imbuing a potentially heavy-handed line-- ""We could be two straight lines/ In a crooked world""-- with enough pathos to avoid any possible pitfalls. Apokalypsis' crowning achievement, however, is the album's penultimate track, ""Pale on Pale"". It's a turgid and powerful, metal-like processional fronted by lilting Gregorian-type chants that eventually turn shrill and cacophonous by the time the seven-minute track reaches its conclusion. Its black-mass ambiance (coupled with its de facto coda, the ambient howl-laden ""To the Forest, Towards the Sea"") is the closest that Apokalypsis comes to realizing the foreboding, frightening airs that Wolfe's image and presentation promise. It's also, not coincidentally, the closest that Chelsea Wolfe comes to sounding less like something else, and more like herself.","Los Angeles ""doom folk"" singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe may white-out her eyes and show a fondness for gothic and Greek typefaces, but Apokalypsis shows there is more than meets the eye.

Extra Playful EP,John Cale,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b162c0084474cd0c1dd9/1:1/w_160/10ab35c0.jpeg,2011-10-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15899-john-cale/,DominoDouble Six,"""Say hello to the future, and goodbye to the past,"" declares John Cale on the first song on his new EP, and no doubt, he's earned the right to sing that line. For a good chunk of the past two years, Cale has been touring a front-to-back performance of his 1973 chamber-pop masterpiece Paris 1919, the most enduring and beloved album amid his sprawling post-Velvet Underground discography. Naturally, the process of revisiting a specific body of work night after night can't help but exert some influence on an artist's subsequent move, and Cale is no different. However, in the case of the Extra Playful EP-- Cale's first release in six years, and a teaser for a new full-length coming in 2012-- the Paris 1919 revival has seemingly inspired him not to revisit that album's orchestrated elegance, but to take a reactionary leap into the opposite direction, to further explore the deconstructed electronic productions and mechanized power pop heard on 2005's Black Acetate. From an artist who's always evinced an adventurous spirit and sense of humor (however dry and dark it may be), the title Extra Playful is to be received as both a promise and a threat. The ideal here is a sort of absurdist, avant-garde take on adult-contemporary pop, feeding straight-forward, mid-tempo rock'n'roll songs and romantic balladry through synthetic sonics and alien frequencies. From the mellotron-like psychedelic textures that lend the endearing serenade ""Whadda Ya Mean By That?"" a woozy, weightless feel, to the Scary Monsters-esque freakazoid guitar squall that rips through the android funk of ""Perfection"", Cale takes considerable glee in destabilizing his songs' structures. To wit, the Francophone-sung trip-hop flashback ""Pile a L'heure"" would sound right at home on some circa-1996 chill-out compilation, were it not for an unnerving background drone that provides a distant echo of Cale's viola-scraping on the Velvets' ""Venus in Furs"". But Cale's sense of playfulness can degenerate into cringe-inducing silliness, as on ""Hey Ray"", which works the same Beats-plus-beats formula as Black Acetate's equally ill-advised ""Brotherman"". As a satire of 1960s idealism, ""Hey Ray"" is actually pretty funny, as Cale plays call-and-response with his backing chorus, counting off each year from the decade before reducing it to a punchline: ""1967-- it's the golden age/ 1968-- and it's all over!” (Tellingly, he stops short of calling out 1969, effectively dismissing the year of Woodstock, Manson, and the lunar landing as just another year with nothing to do.) As a song, however, ""Hey Ray"" is a sore-thumb irritant on an EP that otherwise carefully mediates between Cale's populist and deviant tendencies. That said, it's still guaranteed to be only the second worst thing a former member of the Velvet Underground will release this year.","John Cale's first release in six years is a playful EP teaser for a full-length coming in 2012; it finds him further exploring the deconstructed electronic productions and mechanized power pop heard on 2005's Black Acetate but it sometimes descends into cringe-inducing silliness.

"The Bootleg Series, Volume 1: Live in Europe 1967",Miles Davis,by: Hank Shteamer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b151c0084474cd0c1dc8/1:1/w_160/ba822d5d.jpeg,2011-10-06 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15887-the-bootleg-series-volume-1-live-in-europe-1967/,ColumbiaLegacy,"The Miles Davis quintet of the mid-to-late 1960s occupies a weird place in the trumpeter's canon. Critics (this one included) will tell you that it isn't just the best band Miles ever led, but one of the choicest small groups in jazz history. If you're not a jazz nerd, though, you may not know it existed. This is because the outfit-- rounded out by tenor saxist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams-- doesn't register on Miles' pop-cultural timeline. The group issued a string of brilliant studio LPs during its 1965-68 run, yet there's no Kind of Blue or Bitches Brew among them; by this period, Miles had pushed way beyond the sumptuously chilled-out sound of the former but hadn't arrived at the murky psych-jazz of the latter. So if the Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams band (often called Miles' second great quintet, in deference to his stellar 1950s group) was transitional, a checkpoint between consensus masterpieces, why should you care that there's a new box set featuring previously unreleased live recordings from this time? Given that nearly every microphase of Davis' career has been expanded into box form by this point-- ask an expert before gifting a random one at Christmas-- casual consumers are right to be suspicious. But Live in Europe 1967, which presents five concerts from October and November of that year on three great-sounding CDs and one DVD, is no footnote: This set, Volume 1 in a new Davis Bootleg Series built on the Bob Dylan model, offers a chance to hear one of the greatest bandleaders of the 20th century push his collaborators into a creative frenzy and be pushed back in return. Aside from Carter, each of these players would become giants of electric jazz (Davis and Hancock transitioned into something like pop stardom), and the period documented on this set represents their farewell to their bebop roots: both an ecstatic celebration and a ballsy deconstruction of how small-group jazz had been played for the previous two decades. Live in Europe 1967 won't soundtrack any romantic dinners or inspire dorm-room acid trips, but it does show off the central thrill of jazz-- spontaneous interplay among dangerously skilled players-- as well as almost any other collection you could name. That ""among"" is key. As much as this set testifies to the leader's own vision, the real takeaway is the virtuosity of other musicians, and how Miles' anti-hierarchical aesthetic spurred them toward the riskiest, most engaged performances of their careers. No player on this set reaches more than Tony Williams. A famously precocious drumming prodigy-- he first recorded with Miles in 1963 at age 17-- he was exactly the kind of daredevil Miles was looking for, a player naturally inclined toward pure outrageousness. (By 1967, he'd already explored cutting-edge improvisation on deeply unusual masterworks such as Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch.) Williams is in particularly wired form here on the version of ""Footprints"" from November 2 in Copenhagen (disc two). During Miles' trumpet solo, the drummer casts himself as Donkey Kong to Davis' Mario, throwing out flaming barrels for the leader to navigate; Williams keeps time on the ride cymbal, but runs a near-constant interference pattern of asymmetrical fills and swelling cymbal flurries. (You can hear the legacy of Williams' pot-stirring percussion style, rarely better documented than on Live in Europe 1967, in players like Deerhoof's Greg Saunier, who loves to slide around a song's central pulse, sending bits of rhythmic shrapnel flying at his bandmates.) As dazzling as Williams sounds, what really catches the ear is how the entire band provides the improvisational boldness that Miles was after. On the Copenhagen ""Footprints"", Herbie Hancock plays like a deranged outsider artist. Instead of providing a sturdy foundation underneath Wayne Shorter's saxophone solo, he offers squiggly little phrases, like jumbled fragments from a 20th-century classical score; on the outro, he answers the horn players' theme statement with a mocking paraphrase. Ron Carter, meanwhile, constantly reconfigures the piece's waltzing bassline, jumping between half-time and double-time, and mixing in percussive slaps and low, droney digressions. These performances represent an upending of the soloist-and-background model of small-group jazz up to this point. Miles' second great quintet wasn't the first to play this way; by 1967, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, and Cecil Taylor had each exploded the conventions of 1940s and 1950s jazz in their own ways. Yet none of these other artists had figured out how to combine deep, risky interactivity with such sustained coherence. Many of the pieces on Live in Europe 1967 play like cooperative action paintings, with everyone allowed but no one entitled to be the center of attention at any given time, and with the overarching logic of the compositions keeping chaos in check. It's at this stage, just before the quintet's dissolution-- over the next two years, as Miles engaged with electric jazz, Carter would exit, followed by Williams and Hancock-- that the conversation is at its most lively and lucid. Crucially, though, freedom, as it was interpreted by this band, didn't always equal volume and density. Some of the strongest moments on Live in Europe 1967 are also the calmest. During ""Masqualero"" from the November 6 Paris concert (disc three), as Miles plays a poignant, slow-building solo, Hancock settles into a haunting, repetitive figure and Williams quiets to a whisper, marking faint tempo on the hi-hat. Later, when Hancock's solo begins, Williams drops out entirely, leaving the pianist and Carter to play a delicate, free-floating duo. During the same set, on ""Walkin'""-- a staple of Davis' 50s repertoire-- Williams and Carter guide Shorter into an up-tempo frenzy and then gradually fade to silence. The saxophonist moves into a rare unaccompanied passage, playing an abstracted kind of bebop, full of tumbling phrases and murmuring digressions. By late 1967, thanks in large part to John Coltrane (who had passed away in July) and mavericks such as Albert Ayler, shrieking, high-density free jazz was in full flower. As you can hear in Live in Europe 1967's many boldly stripped-down moments, Miles and his band were aiming for a different kind of freedom, one where aggression coexisted with near-stillness. Funk was in the mix too: During the October 28 ""Masqualero"" in Antwerp (disc one), Williams and Carter keep up an infectious Latin pulse behind the soloists, providing a danceable base for Shorter to tear off his heated phrases and also foreshadowing Davis' groove-based experiments, which would begin in earnest on 1969's In a Silent Way. Miles clearly savored this band's broad dynamic and emotional range, and constructed its sets accordingly. Unlike the quintet's studio recordings, the concerts on Live in Europe 1967 take the form of unbroken medleys. On four out of the five sets here, the tempestuous ""Footprints"", a Shorter original, segues into the Thelonious Monk favorite ""'Round Midnight"", which begins each time as a beautifully sparse dialogue between Davis and Hancock. Other transitions keep these long sets feeling brisk. In Antwerp, a lengthy version of Miles' hard-swinging, midtempo ""No Blues"", gives way to a turbulent three-minute sprint through Hancock's ""Riot""; in Paris, ""No Blues"" snaps into Shorter's moody, Spanish-inflected ""Masqualero"", a striking shift that immediately reengages the ear. Live in Europe 1967 marks the first time we're hearing this band engage with such a wide range of material; a previous second-great-quintet live box, The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, featured mainly well-worn jazz standards. As much microscopic variety as there is in these shows, it's important to note that Live in Europe 1967 documents a single tour with a more or less fixed set list. Davis did vary the repertoire occasionally-- trying out ""Walkin'"" and the standard ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" in Paris-- but buyers interested in a more diverse overview of what this band could do might be better off picking up one of their studio releases (E.S.P., from 1965, and Nefertiti, recorded just a few months before the shows heard here, are both great starting points). Don't let the repetition scare you away, though. All five concerts here have their own rewards and idiosyncrasies; the best path through the box is to treat each segment like the concert it originally was and savor it individually. The DVD, which documents two shows not featured on the CDs, is a sharp addition. There's a bit of arty treatment-- often two players appear superimposed in the same frame-- but on the whole, these are tasteful black-and-white concert films that put you in the midst of the onstage action. You see the youthful Williams bearing down fiercely on his ride, Shorter entering a closed-eyes trance while playing, and Hancock cocking his ear, tuning in to his bandmates' improvisations with genuine curiosity. And in the middle of it all is Miles: his usual, unflappable self. This is one of our last glimpses of the trumpeter in pre-psychedelic mode; the sequined pants and wraparound shades would arrive by 1969, as Miles flipped for Jimi and Sly and started co-billing with future rock legends at the Fillmore and the Isle of Wight, but here he sports natty suits (the sidemen wore tuxes), embodying the same model of 50s cool that won the trumpeter a mention in a 1960 Esquire list of ""Some of the Best-Dressed Men in the United States."" That shift in fashion wasn't just superficial; Miles' music changed drastically in the period following Live in Europe 1967. LPs such as 1969's In a Silent Way and 1970's Bitches Brew are still some of the most compelling jazz-crossover experiments ever attempted. And Miles' sidemen would make equally important contributions to the movement that came to be known as fusion: Shorter with the vibrant Weather Report, Hancock with his funky Mwandishi and Headhunters bands, and Williams with Lifetime, one of the grittiest and heaviest of the early jazz-rock groups. These impending transitions are part of why Live in Europe 1967 is essential: You get to hear exactly how these virtuosos were behaving just before the big change occurred. They were still operating in an old mode, small-group acoustic jazz, but they were interrogating it relentlessly, seeing how far they could stretch its conventions without ditching them altogether. Before they could break into the larger world of pop, they had to reach jazz nirvana, and that's what they attain on Live in Europe 1967. The aesthetic here is less easily definable than those heard on Kind of Blue and Bitches Brew, but it's no less significant. At its heart, jazz thrives on bold, sensitive interaction in the moment, and Live in Europe 1967 represents the pinnacle of that practice.","This 3xCD/DVD set documents Davis shows from 1967 with his second great quintet. It offers a chance to hear one of the greatest bandleaders of the 20th century push his collaborators and be pushed in turn, into a creative frenzy.

"The Less You Know, The Better",DJ Shadow,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d3c0084474cd0c1cfe/1:1/w_160/a192db3e.jpeg,2011-10-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15900-the-less-you-know-the-better/,IslandVerveA&M,"Everyone is sick of hearing about how DJ Shadow will never top Endtroducing…, most of all Shadow himself. But what about those of us still holding the torch for Psyence Fiction, his insanely hyped, tragically flawed, and surprisingly enduring collaboration with James Lavelle as UNKLE? With hindsight, the buzz surrounding that release seems quaint, but it came along during a time when CD storage towers were still proudly manicured physical manifestations of their owner's listening habits. Meaning it was worth sitting through all 13 false endings of ""Lonely Soul"" and the wackest Beastie Boys verses ever put to wax because you certainly weren't getting peak performances from Kool G Rap, Badly Drawn Boy, and Thom Yorke on a single disc anywhere else. The good news then is that the bullishly titled The Less You Know, the Better finds Shadow back in that same mode of crowd-pleasing genre consumption. Problem is, you'll think it's even better news if you've still got that same exact CD collection from 1998. The Less You Know isn't really a record that has you asking ""What was he thinking?"" out of exasperation so much as genuine and concerned curiosity. After all, it's not like Shadow releases new music for any old reason. He puts out records sporadically and titles his albums like manifestos. And his collaborators seem to know they're not part of some tossed-off project-- even the singer-songwriter contributions here sound like they're deferentially acknowledging the boss. Like every DJ Shadow album, it's a statement of some sort. But whether The Less You Know was intended to reestablish Shadow as a musician, as a producer, or even as someone with decent taste, he misfires on all counts. Judging from this year's I Gotta Rokk EP, you could assume he had traded his turntables in for guitars and then decided to buy the turntables back. But as deep as his understanding of beat-driven music is, he's got a total tin ear for rock proper, and as such, and The Less You Know plays like a DJ-Kicks curated by a particularly unadventurous KROQ jock. Bad enough that the palm-muted guitar chug of ""Border Crossing"" finds Shadow trying to recreate ""She Watch Channel Zero!?"" by getting his fingers dusty digging in crates of Godsmack records. But as worrying as the conceptual aspect is, the execution is inexcusably half-assed for someone of Shadow's sample-chopping acumen. It's simply a weak guitar sound, the sort of RAT Distortion lick you can hear at the nearest Sam Ash, and like many of the cuts here, there's a perfectly decent 20-second intro that gets looped into becoming the entire track. But as an instrumental, I suppose it's worlds better than the acoustic-slappin' folk-n-beats combo ""I've Been Trying""-- I envy those who hear it and can't immediately identify the Incubus song that sounds exactly like it (spoiler: ""Drive""). You can call ""Sad and Lonely"" feminized blues haunted by CGI ghosts or whatever you choose; just know that Moby tired of it nearly a decade ago. All of which is just a long way to say that The Less You Know is the kind of forward-thinking excursion that inevitably donates its sole hip-hop track to Talib Kweli. Credit where it's due: at least he and Posdnuos resist the temptation to turn in ""Why Hip-Hop Sucks in 2011"", but over papery jazz-rap that could've been the softest track on any Soundbombing comp, the two kick the sort of polite, earnest, and flair-free 16s that come to them as effortlessly as college student union checks. The name of the track? ""Stay the Course"", of course. Mind you, that's just the first half and before Shadow starts throwing out bleeding chum ostensibly meant to distract you from The Less You Know's deep-seated and fundamental problems. Take the 28-second pit stop of ""Going Nowhere"" (""slowly we are getting nowhere, and that is a pleasure"") or the four minutes of Beat poetry that simply had to be included for comic relief or at least a preapproved mocking point for critics, a track called ""Give Me Back the Nights"". Funny thing about ""Nights"" is that it's actually the best thing here, a brief and haunted dub workout that earns a pretty cheap accolade of ""cinematic,"" but at least achieves its intended purpose. It works far better than ""Enemy Lines"", five interminable minutes of watery flange guitars and a vague awareness of witch house, or ""I Gotta Rokk"", whose glammed-up monotony actually has less to do with T. Rex than it does with the likes of Propellerheads, Freestylers, Wiseguys, or any other big-beat late adapter who owes their ad royalties to the invention of the word ""electronica."" He at least hasn't lost his ear for drums-- the actual sound of the percussion on The Less You Know is often fantastic, all kinds of crisp snares and satisfying crackle giving you the hope that some intrepid beatmaker might be able to salvage some of this for his own devices. But outside of a good drumbreak, what is Shadow actually bringing to the table here? Featuring Yukimi Nagano, ""Scale It Back"" is the kind of cosmopolitan electro-pop that could just as easily have been a B-side on the latest Little Dragon album. Unfortunately, the same applies to the Aqua Net stiffness of Tom Vek's Flock of Seagulls rip ""Warning Call"", which could've just as easily have been an A-side on his last album. Which raises the question: Why does he care about these songs, when they deign to say so little? Better yet, why does he think you should? Perhaps you've noticed that the word ""hyphy"" hasn't been used up until now, which some might take as a sign that The Less You Know simply has to be better than The Outsider, his widely disliked excursion into Bay Area hip-hop that's aged about as well as, um, hyphy itself. But at least that showed some sort of interest in the contemporary, not to mention the balls to say he's moved on from Endtroducing.... And whether or not he's made one of the most influential electronic albums ever, I think Shadow has the right to be a working producer who doesn't have to show us how he feels about dubstep or Brainfeeder. After all, dude's on Verve, a label that certainly allows an artist the freedom to not give a shit about what the kids are into. But The Less You Know can't even be staunchly retro, or staunchly anything. Its only commitment is to a subtle antagonism, and it ignores pretty much any worthwhile development in pop, rock, electronic, or hip-hop music since the turn of the century.","Blending electric guitars, beats, rock, and rap, DJ Shadow's new album finds him back in the mode of crowd-pleasing genre consumption à la UNKLE's Psyence Fiction. Problem is, the particular music he draws from here in no way plays to his strengths.

Ideas of Distance,Young Man,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15aea9e61561daa677a/1:1/w_160/6d34ba69.jpg,2011-10-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15891-young-man-ideas-of-distance/,Frenchkiss,"Colin Caulfield's story is entwined with the music of recent indie rock greats. While the leader of the Young Man project was studying English and French at Loyola, he took to YouTube to offer covers from bands like Beach House and Panda Bear and also posted a few originals. Bradford Cox found his version of Deerhunter's ""Rainwater Cassette Exchange"" on YouTube, posted it on his blog, and called it superior to his original. Then came the signing to Frenchkiss and a 2010 debut EP; Boy was like a sunnier version of Cox's music. With the Deerhunter cover still somewhat fresh, it was easy to view Boy as ""the EP by 'Rainwater Cassette Exchange' cover guy."" The internet doesn't forget that stuff. To some, Caulfield will always be that guy. But what can he do? Clearly, he's inspired by Cox and Noah Lennox, so some of his music clearly shows that influence. And sometimes, it's hard to ignore. On Ideas of Distance, his full-length debut, there are ghostly harmonies and fingerpicked guitars that at times evoke Cox's vibe (especially on ""Then and Now""). But it seems doubtful that Caulfield's intent was to be Lil' Bradford, and here he's added a few new wrinkles and veers into ambient territory. He told Spinner that around the time he recorded Ideas of Distance, he was ""almost exclusively"" listening to ambient music from artists such as Tim Hecker and Wolfgang Voigt. You can hear that influence percolating throughout the songs. Caulfield still has his guitar, but he uses synths to fill out a darker, more spacious, and more atmospheric sound than Boy. At times the mood is there, but the music has a hard time conveying emotion. ""Low"" features over four minutes of simple acoustic guitar licks, later accompanied by swelling horns and buried dialogue. It sounds pleasant, but again, there's no real build or pull to it. The volume picks up toward the end, but faraway screams and high notes from the horns don't do anything too compelling to pull the song out of its mundane flow. ""Only You"", which is mostly Caulfield's a cappella vocals, is the same story-- over four minutes without any tug. Static music has its place, but it it's a tough fit on an album driven by love and heartbreak. Ideas of Distance does have a more fleshed-out sound than Boy, and there are some compelling elements in play. ""Tired Eyes"", aside from leaning on a well-worn analogy between the end of a relationship and the end of a road trip, is a beautiful ballad with glitchy synths. ""Nothing"" features the best hook on the album, and its droplet synths and drum machine backing don't leave much room for empty space. ""Felt"" is over 10 minutes and uses pillowy synths and string sounds. The unadorned acoustic guitar in the last minute feels especially powerful. At moments like this, Young Man transcends easy comparisons. Boy was a set of cheerful bedroom recordings about being a kid, and you can hear Caulfield trying to run away from that sound. Ideas of Distance feels like an album about growing up. At times, the vague lyrics about love and the darker vibe sound like an affectation. It's Caulfield's first foray into more mood-driven territory, and it ultimately feels like a collection of pleasant sketches, unburdened by the need to resolve a sound or be especially deep.","The Chicago singer-songwriter who debuted with the Boy EP in 2010 returns with a full-length offering. He's still indebted to Bradford Cox and Panda Bear, but here the focus is more on instrumentals and ambience.

Lose Today,Stare Case,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b159c0084474cd0c1dcf/1:1/w_160/470fa662.jpeg,2011-10-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15890-lose-today/,De Stijl,"Michigan trio Wolf Eyes are known for bursts of harsh noise, but they've also made lots of interesting music on the way to those climaxes-- during the pregnant pauses, eerie bits of calm, and gradual build-ups that explode into raucous release. Stare Case, the ""blues roots"" duo of Wolf Eyes' John Olson and Nate Young, deal primarily in that restrained territory, where minimalism and quietude bulge with possibility. On Lose Today, the implied eruptions never come, but always seem to be just over the horizon, creating a constant tension even when the pair sound comfortably stoned. Much of that tension comes from an unlikely source: Young's bass, an instrument he hadn't played on record before Stare Case began in 2010. It's the center of the five songs here, and it's always slow and sparse, with plucks doled out like ominous ticks of a time bomb. On top of that heavy foundation, Olson spreads swaths of electronics and horns, while Young sings in a manner straighter and clearer than his more strenuous Wolf Eyes vocalizing. ""You never lost, 'cause you never wanted to/ But maybe you just never had a plan,"" he moans wearily on the title track, echoing the way Jandek turns a few simple, lonely words into something thoroughly creepy and hypnotic. Jandek may seem like lofty company to put Stare Case in this early-- Lose Today is technically their debut full-length. But they've already made reams of low-run cassettes and CD-Rs via Olson's American Tapes label. All that public woodshedding has honed their approach-- they've clearly grown into a fully formed entity rather than a side project. Olson in particular has become a deft sonic commentator. When he slyly inserts sax runs in ""Days Like Faces"", or sticks in small ripples of electronic noise during ""Bed That Eats"", he shows an uncanny knack for sounding loose and random at first, but remarkably precise on closer inspection. His interjections have a kind of storytelling feel, turning abstraction into narrative. It's hard to guess what turns the Stare Case plot will take next. I've listened to a lot of their rumblings in the past year and have yet to tire of the way their music lurks and lurches around, like the unexplained creaks of a decaying house's dimly lit basement. It seems likely that they'll eventually unleash the loud detonations that Lose Today implies and previous releases have veered toward. The impressive patience that Olson and Young have exhibited so far has certainly earned them the right to fire away.","Debut full-length from Wolf Eyes' John Olson and Nate Young forgoes the harsh-noise bursts of their main band in favor of minimalist tension-building.

III,Gui Boratto,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15bb1335d7bf169a27f/1:1/w_160/ae85e846.jpeg,2011-10-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15892-gui-boratto-iii/,Kompakt,"Brazilian electronic producer Gui Boratto got his start working in advertising and making pop music, two worlds where superficial sheen and polish are of paramount importance. It's easy to see the connection from his earlier life to his current solo work, for Kompakt and other labels: His tracks are vibrant, ear-pleasing candy of the most licensable order, and his full-length albums have thus far stuck to a fairly simple formula: one or two big, dreamy, tastefully sun-kissed vocal house anthems selling the surrounding tangents into minimal techno. If that doesn't sound like a golden ratio, you're right: While Gui Boratto's Chromophobia and Take My Breath Away are both solid, sometimes spectacular albums, you're most likely to have Boratto saved in your mp3 locker as a singles artist, best known for evaporating vocal tracks like ""Beautiful Life"", ""Like You"", and ""No Turning Back"", or for his subtly percolating *Total 7 *instrumental ""Arquipélago"". But while those remain his most breathtaking songs, such an appraisal does disservice to his deeper album material-- tracks that, once you stop hunting for the car-commercial hook, make for some pretty enveloping listening. III, Boratto's sensibly titled third album for Kompakt, follows the same pattern as his previous records, but it also pushes that balance between pop standouts and functionalist tracks further. Here, the vocal tracks are buried, both in terms of mixing and album sequencing, and instead the record emphasizes Boratto's range as a producer. There is some range, and some real technical skill on display here. Album opener ""Galuchat"" comes on with a filter-swaddled melody that sounds borrowed from an early-2000s Morr Music artist-- Lali Puna, perhaps-- and which all but invites you to imagine a lyric over it. ""Stems from Hell"" and ""The Drill"" demonstrate Boratto's facility with darker, steamier techno-- all pneumatic pumping rhythms, ominous melodies, and grain-spitting synth sounds. Surprisingly, two of the vocal tracks here, ""Striker"" and ""Destination: Education"", hew to a similar mood, more underlit-corner-of-warehouse nightclub than roof-down, coastal-highway cruising. More so than on any other Gui Boratto album, the moments of brightness seem to lift off out of a largely melancholy gray. It all culminates with the soft, steady thaw of ""This Is Not the End"", the best vocal track here, but also a rather Gui-by-numbers retread of its superior pop predecessors. So if you're not already sold on Boratto as an album-length artist, III isn't likely to get you there. Worse than that, though, it doesn't have any a single exceptional track to add to the singles pile. Instead, it's another merely fine, expectation-meeting entry into Boratto's discography, a stopgap until the next knockout single comes along.","The Brazilian electronic producer typically makes albums that surround sun-kissed vocal house anthems with steady minimal techno, but here the mood is a shade darker and more diffuse.

LateNightTales,MGMT,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15313d197565213a5e0/1:1/w_160/8319e78e.png,2011-10-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15885-mgmt/,Late Night Tales,"For MGMT, the best thing about selling a million copies of your debut album is not all the cocaine, heroin, elegant cars, and models for wives that a platinum record presumably affords you. No, the real reward is in being elevated to a position where your words suddenly carry some weight, where a simple endorsement can provide a career boost to an unsung forebear. In retrospect, MGMT's wiggy, divisive 2010 release, Congratulations, was less a premeditated ploy to alienate their more casual fans than a noble attempt to turn them onto some of Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser's more eccentric influences, via songs named after cult heroes like Brian Eno and Television Personalities founder Dan Treacy. And if but one of the 39 million people who've watched the ""Kids"" video on YouTube was inspired to pick up a Spacemen 3 record on account of seeing Pete ""Sonic Boom"" Kember's name listed in the Congratulations liner notes, then his producer's fee was worth it. (Likewise, when recently invited to perform a cover for Pink Floyd Week on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"", MGMT passed over the Floyd's deep well of FM-radio standards in favor of Syd Barrett's menacing ""Lucifer Sam"".) That same charitable spirit more explicitly informs MGMT's curatorial contribution to the LateNightTales series, which draws evenly from obscure turn-of-the-1970s psych-folk, the more pastoral end of 80s post-punk and indie, and modern variations thereof. The tracklist is dotted with some notable avant-rock icons (the Velvet Underground, Spacemen 3, Suicide), but they're represented by serenely atypical tracks (""Ocean"", ""Lord Can You Hear Me?"" and ""Cheree"", respectively) that serve to set up this compilation's more esoteric selections. And as if to further increase their aesthetic distance from Oracular Spectacular's day-glo pop hits, the mood here is almost uniformly somber, if not downright ominous (hello there, ""Pink Frost"" by the Chills). More so than previous participants in the series, VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take the LateNightTales concept at face value, weaving together their song choices into a dark-night-of-the-soul narrative heavy on themes of isolation and 4 a.m. introspection. Even the band's own contribution is a straightforward rendition of the one Bauhaus song (""All We Ever Wanted Was Everything"") that perfectly suits this stoned-and-dethroned mood. VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take great care to ease you into this despairing headspace, opening with the fortuitously timed inclusion of a track from the recently resuscitated Disco Inferno (the gorgeously glistening ""Can't See Through It""), and offsetting more droll depictions of loneliness (the Television Personalities' ""Stop & Smell the Roses"", Julian Cope's ""Laughing Boy"") with affecting instrumental interludes (Felt's ""Red Indians"", the Durutti Column's ""For Belgium Friends""). However, everything on this compilation feels like a set-up for and recovery from the harrowing ""Drug Song"" by Dave Bixby, a 70s-era Christian folk singer whose songs of spiritual reawakening are nonetheless colored with melancholy and regret; divorced from their born-again context, lines like ""How did I get this way/ It's so unreal/ I'm no longer a person/ I can't even feel"" seem especially resonant for a couple of guys who went from recording in their dorm room to suddenly finding themselves playing VIP parties at upscale department stores. MGMT may have gotten famous by ironically declaring they're fated to pretend, but with LateNightTales they take solace in building a soundtrack for when shit gets real.","The psych-pop outfit's contribution to the long-running LateNightTales series is heavy on obscure turn-of-the-1970s psych-folk and the more pastoral end of 80s post-punk and indie.

Conatus,Zola Jesus,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13b9d034d5c69bf49c1/1:1/w_160/8756b45e.jpeg,2011-10-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15897-conatus/,Sacred Bones,"Nika Roza Danilova began her Zola Jesus project with a formidable arsenal already in place. She had a richly gothic perspective honed by a rural upbringing and studies in philosophy, a background in opera conjoined with a taste for industrial music, and a scarred-yet-commanding voice. The albums and EPs she issued over the last couple of years were startlingly realized for such a young artist, but Conatus, a big record that keeps turning dark and strident, makes them seem like warning shots. Most traces of obscuring murk have burned away, so that every pock and ridge in the rugged, elemental music stands out distinctly. It's new wave mounted on a geological scale, where Danilova's solipsistic spirit-- ""I was able to communicate this universe that is my prison,"" she said of ""Vessel""-- assumes epic proportions. Her bouts of nihilism feel nervier and more bracing in the unforgiving light of sonic clarity. The closer she gets, the more enigmatic she's revealed to be. Conatus is mainly built from thundering toms, majestically revolving synthesizers, and warm courses of classical stringed instruments. ""I kept having these primal images,"" she said of the music, ""just quite strange landscapes and shapes I couldn't shake."" That may sound like a meaningless gloss, but on ""Swords"", the minute-long opening track, you can hear exactly what she means. Concussive drums and scrolling mechanical textures vividly evoke a terrain. Whatever biosphere you choose to project on it (I get desert), Danilova's voice remains fixed on a faraway horizon, receding as you approach. When she bursts into the foreground on ""Avalanche"" and stays there for the remainder of the album, the impression of impassable distance lingers. This is partly because of the authority of Danilova's voice, and partly because the music gives nothing away, thrumming along with power that shades into ambivalence toward the shifting emotional register of the singing. The results are dramatic but never melodramatic, as Danilova maps the dimensions of her self-imprisonment with resolve. There has always been something almost subliminally idol-killing about the Zola Jesus project, and it really comes into focus here. Danilova's childhood opera aspirations are subverted into something nearly opposite. Opera singing is narrative and flows smoothly from deep within. Danilova is more allusive and tortuous. Her voice keeps getting caught in her throat, where it's stressed and twisted by transient emotional surges. Though the theatricality and the epic-pop trappings may evoke artists like Dead Can Dance, the vocals have the passion of blues singing. Danilova is equally iconoclastic when it comes to industrial influences like Throbbing Gristle, finding ways to make abrasion as musical as possible without sacrificing tension. Her touchstones have been digested into a personal style that is much more substance than reference. She has said that she struggled with the psychological pressures of opera singing. You could regard her early run of Zola Jesus recordings as a direct reaction against intricate formality and classical perfection: an eruptive loosening of strictures and simultaneous retreat into shadow. Though some may miss the rough and raw approach of her last two EPs, it's refreshing and exciting to hear music that relies on bone-hard essence rather than gauzy trimmings to create an aura of mystery. There's a newfound sense of purpose, as if, having tested her abilities, Danilova now understands exactly what she's doing.","The albums and EPs Nika Roza Danilova issued over the last couple of years were startlingly realized for such a young artist.

Plus,Luomo,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14a13d197565213a5d9/1:1/w_160/c98837e1.jpeg,2011-10-04 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15883-plus/,Moodmusic,"First you notice what's missing: gone are the gently echoing dubscapes, the shivering multi-tracked female vocals, the heartsore melodies, the insectile arrangements, the billowing evocations of desire. Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti's Luomo is nominally his ""house"" project (as distinct from excursions into stripped-back dub-techno or fractured ambience) but to date it has consistently flirted with an idea of house-- as feminine, gentle, lovelorn, ostentatiously emotive-- quite distinct from the often quite blunt realities of the genre. Plus, then, is Ripatti's first album of house qua house: specifically the cooler, big-room sound of tech-house circa 2006, equal parts Michael Mayer and Carl Craig. If Luomo's previous work often could feel like the sound of the ""body speaking"" (to steal the title of one of his best tracks), the colder and harder surfaces of Plus are positioned between the body and the dancefloor, less the sound of movement than the sounds that make you move. Song takes a backseat to groove: while most of the tracks here feature gentle ""Computer Love""-style male vocals (courtesy of the Chicago Boys), they are less the music's emotional center than a framework around which Ripatti can weave his typically intricate, hypnotic arrangements. Only on the fragile, trebly new wave of ""Form in Void"" and the seductive schaffel of ""Immaculate Motive"" does Ripatti gesture toward the glittering disco-pop of his prior work. This feels like a deliberate aesthetic shift. Previously, many of Luomo's finest tracks featured late-blooming hooks that would carry the tune's second half in euphoric or melancholy new directions. By contrast, the best moments on Plus tend to turn inward, homing in on the beat until its urgency is almost too close to your ears. The effect can be like sitting in the front row at the cinema, the peripheral details of melodic color and vocals overwhelmed by the abstract throb of the hyper-percussive, multi-tiered groove. In particular, the massive climaxes of ""How You Look"" and especially ""Make My Day"" (by some distance the album's finest moment) feel designed to burn out your senses with an overload of physical intensity. These tracks stand and fall on their own robust physicality: ""Happy Strong"" features an inane vocal hook and almost no melody to speak of, but its immense, banging groove (all slamming snares and delectable hand-clap counter-rhythms) makes it an album highlight. Only on ""Good Stuff"" does Ripatti's new aesthetic veer off course entirely, spending nine minutes trying but failing to achieve lift-off through chattering Chicago-house revivalism. Here, the groove isn't compelling enough to distract from the perfunctory song it props up. If Plus ultimately is only the fourth-best Luomo album (after 2008's Convivial and certainly Ripatti's peerless first two albums under the moniker), it's because maintaining that level of intensity across entire tracks, let alone a whole album, is near impossible, while the moments in between the peaks no longer can coast on the singularity of the producer's sound. The less-exciting stretches on previous albums at least might have boasted a bruised-sounding bassline or delicately mutated vocal harmonies to establish a sense of unity with the climaxes. On Plus, the periods in between the climaxes can slip more easily into the category of fine-- but rather less-distinct-- German-sounding tech-house. The importance of this criticism depends on how invested you are in house as dancefloor music first and foremost: Ripatti's music demands to be judged purely on the terms of the genre it inhabits, and the way that genre interacts with the bodies of dancers. If you come looking for house with an obvious point of difference, this decision seems puzzling, but if you're prepared to forget the name ""Luomo"" and simply lose yourself in the groove, then Plus is as involving and engaging as any dance music you'll hear this year.","Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti aka Vladislav Delay returns with his house-oriented Luomo alias. This time out, the focus is less on songs than groove and his typically intricate, hypnotic arrangements.

Forever,Sleep ∞ Over,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1289d034d5c69bf49a3/1:1/w_160/4c556f11.jpeg,2011-10-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15858-sleep-over-forever/,Hippos in Tanks,"Austin's Sleep ∞ Over first appeared as a trio with a woozy pop 7"" on Forest Family last year. Since then, they've slimmed down to one member, Stefanie Franciotti, who returns with an upgraded full-length debut that plays like a shoegaze record for a generation reared on The NeverEnding Story. Franciotti's sound hinges on her dual interest in highly textured pop and errant noise. On the project's early tracks, those elements resulted in a sound that was aimless and a little soupy, if still pretty. Here, Franciotti is able to create a dynamic contrast by giving equal prominence to each, alternating between new wave-indebted slow-dance jams and experimental tracks that range in tone from sublimely ambient to jagged and far-out. This puts Franciotti in the company of Peaking Lights and Sun Araw, and while she's not as cosmically bent as either, she's making the same kind of escapist music that, at its best, can feel transportative. Ultimately, the album's song-oriented material is the most memorable. ""Romantic Streams"", ""Casual Diamond"", and highlight ""Stickers"" are peppered with space-age chimes and melting glissandos that feel grounded and organic. And despite all the machine noise, Franciotti's vocals feel approachable and human. Though her singing is sometimes unremarkable, at times sound like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar (this is a compliment). At these moments, Forever's frozen lullabies provide mix immediate gratification with a hint of mystery.","After releasing a few promising tracks in the last year, this Austin, Texas, project arrives with its full-length debut.

Life in the Trenches,The Embassy,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f2ea9e61561daa66d5/1:1/w_160/5be2c27b.jpg,2011-10-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15812-life-in-the-trenches/,Service,"In 2001, a Gothenburg, Sweden-based duo called the Embassy released a 7"" titled Sneaky Feelings. Sharing a name with both an Elvis Costello song and a jangly 1980s New Zealand indie-pop group, the four-song EP was little-noticed by Americans at the time, but it marked a turning point for their city's music scene. Blending Fredrik Lindson's yearning vocals and chiming guitar chords with Torbjörn Håkansson' pattering percussion, euphoric electronics, and occasional exotic sample or two, the record had more in common with the twee-meets-house hybrids of early-1990s Saint Etienne than with any record of its period-- even the Avalanches' similarly balmy, ambitious Since I Left You. By the end of the 2000s, echoes of the Embassy's aesthetic could be found in critically acclaimed albums by Jens Lekman, the Tough Alliance (who named their imprint, Sincerely Yours, after an Embassy song), Studio (ditto for their Information imprint), Air France, jj, and the Honeydrips, among others. Gothenburg's indie pop scene was now run by mysterious pranksters all too happy to tie the already thin line between sincerity and artifice up in sailing knots. Life in the Trenches contains 13 hard-to-find tracks, most of which haven't appeared on an album. The set has a gleaming surface-level appeal, with the meticulous production and bountiful melodies that are to Sweden what beer is to Milwaukee. This music's vibrant lushness is most evident on the two newest tracks, the stoic strummer ""You Tend to Forget"" and loping fake-it-til-you-make-it manual ""St8"", both 2009 singles-- a woman's soft moan, a vaguely African vocal snippet, or a bit of oceanic echo converts fairly simple songs into endlessly replayable tracks. But there's a fragile, unfiltered quality to Lindson's contributions, in particular, that keeps the atmospheric prettiness from lapsing into wallpaper. Slick craftsmanship? Raw expression? The Embassy reinforce how moot such questions can be. Life in the Trenches also embodies most of the contradictions that make the Embassy so beguiling. The impression of earnest sensitivity that makes you want to pat the guys on the head often gives way to a mischievousness that leaves a not-unpleasant sensation that you're being had. Subtitled ""The Other Side of 2001-2011,"" the album sure gives the impression of being a rarities compilation, but one of the songs, ""Information"", appeared on the second of the band's two highly recommended full-lengths, 2005's Tacking. Then there's 2004 single ""Flipside of a Memory"", which starts with a guitar part that's jarringly similar to Nirvana's bone-simple ""Come as You Are"" riff, then builds it into a shiny electro-pop stomper about old love-- vague and vaguely familiar but no less affecting for either. Whether venturing into synth-drenched instrumentals (""Puttgarden""), dubwise hip-house (""Heathrow""), or distorted electro-rock (""No Thanks""), Life in the Trenches rarely keeps its simple pleasures as simple as they may at first appear. If these guys were handing out Halloween candy, you'd check it for syringes. In 2011, the Embassy look finally poised to capture some of the attention they were too early for the first time around. Elements of their cryptic presentation and polished yet slightly warped sonics can be heard across the indie pop spectrum, and the press materials for Life in the Trenches hint at potential new Embassy recordings in the near future. In the meantime, it's worth seeking out Tacking and 2002's Futile Crimes (itself a likely inspiration for the Tough Alliance title ""Silly Crimes"") to get a fuller glimpse of the duo's style. As for the Sneaky Feelings EP, the only copy I can find online is selling for upwards of $100, and the other non-album releases compiled here aren't much easier to track down. So for those of us who prefer to own our music in tangible form, Life in the Trenches is the best chance many listeners have had to acquaint themselves with these overlooked architects of some of the past decade's best new sounds.","The Embassy are a Swedish band from Gothenburg whose approach to indie pop proved hugely influential to bands like the Tough Alliance, Jens Lekman, and Air France. This set collects rarities and some album tracks and hangs together surprisingly well as a whole.

Foolish,Superchunk,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b158b1335d7bf169a274/1:1/w_160/9f902cd4.jpeg,2011-10-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15889-foolish/,Merge,"In certain key ways, Superchunk's Foolish perfectly sums up what made so much early-1990s indie rock so great. It was rambunctious enough for kids who craved the caffeinated buzz of punk rock at its catchiest. It was also tender enough for kids who loved hearing their own human-sized romantic foibles reflected in indie's everyperson approach to the love song. Foolish can be plenty fast and plenty noisy, but it skips the meathead aggression that's a nasty side effect of so much fast and noisy music. It's unafraid of getting down to personal angst, but smart enough not to get all gross and mawkish about it. It was made by a group who could have walked off stage and gone to their day jobs without having to change out of their Rock Band costumes. These are the kind of songs about bad breakups, worse parties, and lonely walks home that you and three of your friends might have written. Except you probably wouldn't have, or couldn't have. Like a lot of early-90s indie music, Foolish still projects a D.I.Y. spirit, a welcoming vibe of accessibility, community, small-scale ingenuity. But there's nothing about the album that really says ""anyone can do this."" In fact, it still sounds like a major statement, albeit one from a self-effacing band. You knew from ""Slack Motherfucker"" that Superchunk would not be destined to play college-town gigs for a couple of years and then disappear. They were just more driven than the bulk of their contemporaries, a work ethic that's pretty obvious from at least album no. 2 onward. You don't come up with that many intense and memorable choruses, or play that tight, thanks to luck. And while they had an anti-pretentious streak that was a godsend in the messianic years of grunge, Foolish is where the band's ambition really blossomed for the first (but not the last) time, a dozen songs that turned small-town heartbreak into loud and weirdly triumphant anthems. A big part of that is the sound of Foolish, and how that sound perfectly complements the more adventurous songs. But then, despite their rep as a smoking live act who do their best to simply translate that vibe in the studio, Superchunk have always had a real knack for picking the right producer for a specific set of songs, almost from the start. Steve Albini's typically unembellished recording on 1991's No Pocky For Kitty accentuated the wiriness of its very frantic tunes. John Reis added an almost claustrophobic, garage-rock intensity to the rawer set that would make up 1993's On the Mouth. Those albums weren't exactly static, though they did get a lot of mileage out of punk's joyful bashing. But Foolish is very much a big-canvas album, full of stark, quiet-loud shifts, songs with more breathing room, and grander peaks. Given that producer Brian Paulson's the guy who recorded Spiderland, he seems to have been the perfect choice to give Foolish the appropriate weight and ferocity. Mac McCaughan and Jim Wilbur's guitars on ""The First Part"" clang and scrape as fiercely as any of the post-hardcore bands coming out of D.C. at the same time. But there's also a real bottom-end under all that trebly attack, the kind missing from most classic indie albums of the period, give or take the similarly minded Archers of Loaf. Paulson keeps things crisp and booming in the low-key moments, going full-tilt when the band decides to get loud. Painful examinations of an exhausted relationship, like ""Keeping Track"" and ""Revelations"", start out at a slow-burn and build to a thrilling climax or three, the wave of feedback coming almost as a relief after all that pensive tension. Foolish is a heavy album, musically and emotionally. But it's also never a drag. That controlled sense of pacing extends not just across the songs but the whole album. There's still plenty of that old joyful bashing, the caustic moments balanced by speed and sweetness. Heart-punching breakup songs like ""Driveway to Driveway"" are also bright shout-alongs. This remaster sounds just fine to me, maybe a little louder in the top end as usual, though my much-played and more-than-a-decade-old CD copy also sounds plenty fine. The real benefit is that Foolish is once again available on vinyl; while clearly aimed at longtime fans, the newly appended live set and handful of other bonuses are still largesse on the part of Merge, one the few labels that actually bothers to include something of value if you're going to repurchase an album you've already owned in multiple formats. But the original album remains the main draw, especially if you just came onboard with last year's swift and colorful and totally fun Majesty Shredding. This is probably the darkest album Superchunk ever made, but however serious Foolish gets, there's always more of the giddy thrill of hearing a group friends who sound like they're having a blast playing together, even if they're also pushing themselves to go further, giving the songs that much more all-or-nothing intensity than everyone else around them.","Merge offers a deluxe reissue of Superchunk's excellent mid-90s record. The album proper has worn very well, and the inclusion of a live set from the period and rehearsal tapes is welcome.

Kinshasa One Two,DRC Music,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1415e6ef959693220c9/1:1/w_160/32f604f5.jpeg,2011-10-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15874-kinshasa-one-two/,Warp,"David Toop imagined future music in his book Ocean of Sound as ""all winking lights and digital exchanges across alien cultures."" In July of this year Blur/Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn brought a group of producers to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in an attempt to forge some of those exchanges of his own. Along for the ride were XL Recordings boss Richard Russell, frequent Albarn collaborator Dan the Automator, and self-styled ""R&B concrete"" producer Actress. Over the course of five days, local musicians came and went, bringing with them various esoteric instruments and lending their vocals to different songs, while Albarn's producer-collective worked as a unit to fashion the finished product into Kinshasa One Two. Video from the recordings highlights the cross-cultural gap that needed to be bridged, with Albarn communicating via hand gestures and vocal inflections, and the rest of his team surrounding the local musicians with the ""winking lights"" of their digital gadgetry. In a sense this is a more fully realized vision of the Mali Music project Albarn released in 2002. That record saw him gingerly feeling out whether harmony could be extracted through the osmosis of his trip-hop and pop-oriented outlook and the work of Malian artists including Afel Bocoum and Toumani Diabaté. In contrast, Kinshasa One Two is a more confident recording, with Albarn still working outside his comfort zone but given little chance to think or breathe due to the self-imposed time limit on the project. All the colors feel a little brighter here, especially when the energy of the Congolese musicians is allowed to shine through. With so many people involved, both locally and from the imported crew of producers, it's no surprise that Kinshasa One Two feels unfocused at times. There's no underlying narrative or musical structure to this record; instead it's a grab bag of ideas and impulses, assembled as an approximation of the raggedy and lively way in which the recordings were conceived. For much of this album, it doesn't feel like the two contrasting approaches solidify into a satisfying whole, with stems of ideas stretching out toward one another but never fully germinating. Instead, the focus gently rocks back and forth. At times (""Hallo"", ""African Space Anthem"") the gap between DRC Music and Gorillaz is negligible. ""Hallo"" comes across like this album's ""Stylo"", with its featherweight pop groove and Albarn's strained falsetto demonstrating his undeniable pop know-how. On ""K-Town"" the group moves closer to the exuberant Ethio-jazz swing of Mulatu Astatke's ""Yègellé Tezeta"", while ""We Come From the Forest"" leaps into a frantic pace via the great swoons of thumb piano that click and clack into place. The latter is a stark demonstration of the successes and failures of this project, where the bubbling electronics of Albarn's team become cursory and intrusive, causing the vigorous backbone laid out by Bokatola System (who surface four times on this album) to feel like it would work better in isolation. So Kinshasa One Two often comes across an album that doesn't know what it wants to be, and that's mostly in keeping with the nature of the way it was conceived. But the raw power of the music from the region, which is presumably what attracted Albarn and his group to make this record, often feels curiously lacking in this context. Perhaps that's an inevitable consequence of mixing up these different styles. But the weak, Portishead-lite beats aren't missed when you hear the vocalist Love performing the song ""Love"" a cappella, and the ultra-distorted hidden track at the end of the album derives a brash charm from its coarse textures. The unshackled nature of those pieces makes the contributions of the Congolese musicians elsewhere on this record feel restrained. There's none of the unhinged joy you might find on a Sublime Frequencies recording like Group Inerane's startling Guitars From Agadez, which causes it to feel like unnecessary restrictions were being imposed for the sake of balance between the musicians involved. It's when the quest for equilibrium eases up that the quality rises a notch or two in either direction. The contribution of Washiba is barely detectable on the slamming, LFO-circa-""Freak"" techno of ""If You Wish to Stay Awake"", while the softly spun groove of ""Lourds"" is pleasingly dominated by the forceful personality of Yende Bongongo. Occasionally successful collaborations arise, usually when the loopy impulses of both sides are fully indulged; the rattle and bump of ""Customs"" is particularly notable in that regard. But often it's hard to reconcile the songs here with the lively video clips from the sessions on the DRC Music Tumblr, and that's its central flaw-- a little spirit got lost along the way, somewhere between the performance and the final mastering, possibly due to the sheer weight of numbers involved in the recording process. Despite those reservations, Kinshasa One Two is worthwhile both as a cause (all proceeds from sales go to Oxfam) and as an experiment, albeit one that requires some judicious editing to extract the tracks that really count.","Damon Albarn, Dan the Automator, UK producer Actress, and others traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to meld their sensibilities with those of local musicians. The result is an interesting if uneven album that feels like a more realized version of Albarn's Mali Music project*.

Eager to Tear Apart the Stars / Intrigue & Stuff Vol. 1 / Intrigue & Stuff Vol. 2,Leyland Kirby,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14dea9e61561daa6766/1:1/w_160/28c16693.jpeg,2011-10-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15882-leyland-kirby-eager-to-tear-apart-the-stars-etc-m/,History Always Favours the Winners,"James Leyland Kirby is an ambient musician whose records tend toward the romantic and sentimental. Tinkling bells, faraway strings layered with static, soft-pedal piano lines ready to soundtrack footage of rain falling from the window of a slow-moving train: This is Kirby's world, and in Kirby's world the moments are lost, the opportunities missed, and the sky gray, then black, than gray again. I suspect this all sounds heavy-handed, but what makes his music appealing to me is its curious lightness. It takes a teenager to be melodramatic, but it takes an adult-- an adult capable of the weird human reflex called nostalgia-- to achieve Kirby's levels of ambivalence and indifference. Eager to Tear Apart the Stars-- his first full-length under his own name since 2009-- is melancholy, sure, but it doesn't strike me as the kind of album designed to make its listeners melancholy. Its operative verbs are drift, float, shrug. A record like this takes poise and patience-- aside from the grim opener ""The Arrow of Time"", I almost never feel any muscle, any sense that a mood is being forced on me. And yet at nearly every turn music like this seems eminently delicate: A stray sound could shake the listener out of whatever dream the album has put them in. There's depth here, too, and enough bass, grain, and atmosphere to make the music as engaging at louder volumes as it is passive at quieter ones. On my first few listens I thought of a quote from the filmmaker and archivist Jonas Mekas that my editor, Mark Richardson, quoted in his review of Fennesz's Endless Summer, in talking about the look of decaying Super-8 film footage: ""time is laying a veil of poetry over them."" Eager is filled with moments where static is employed as a texturing device and sounds have a recycled, distant, and broken-down character. In 2011, this tactic is nothing new-- nostalgia is just a clipped signal away. Ultimately, though, that is where the album's poetry comes from: hearing Kirby's sweet, sad piano and string lines sound like they're crumbling as they reach our ears. Eager is Kirby's second great album of 2011: He's also responsible for the Caretaker project, under which he released An Empty Bliss Beyond This World near the beginning of summer. The alias isn't really just for the sake of the artist's ego: While both this record and and An Empty Bliss have an unrepentantly nostalgic quality to them, the Caretaker records have become narrowly focused on microedits of pre-war parlor and ballroom music, but the music Kirby's releasing under his own name has a more cinematic, less conceptually unified feel. I'm not sure one's better than the other: There's something satisfying about how contained the Caretaker sound is, and something equally satisfying about how permissible-- and personal-- Kirby sounds under his own name. I can't say as many nice things about the two Intrigue & Stuff 12""s he's put out this year. The first has a vaguely techno conceit to parts of it, with more clearly defined and rhythmically rigid synthesizers. The second, for interested parties, is closer to Eager, but denser and outrightly threatening. In both cases what I think turns me off about them-- and what turns me on about Eager-- is the constant feeling of Kirby's presence, pushing buttons, triggering things, mixing sounds together. And that brings me back to what makes Eager a compelling and frankly weird album: At times, it sounds like there's nobody there making it.","This full-length and two 12""s from the veteran ambient conceptualist behind the Caretaker project show the range and depth of his interests and his uncanny mastery of haunted atmosphere.

In the Pit of the Stomach,We Were Promised Jetpacks,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12b9d034d5c69bf49a7/1:1/w_160/c277205d.jpeg,2011-10-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15859-in-the-pit-of-the-stomach/,Fat Cat,"Preconceptions are usually kind of a bitch, but they've mostly worked in this Scottish band's favor. Knowing that they were championed by Frightened Rabbit on MySpace and then signed to FatCat would have you believe that they're similarly aligned as scrappy, heart-on-sleeve romantics. And yes, their 2009 debut, These Four Walls, delivered on that notion, however intermittently. But based on the name We Were Promised Jetpacks, you might think they're a hyper-stimulated and wordy post-hardcore/emo act too. That's also kinda true. Shuttling between the sound of weathered, masculine brooding and the lyrical sentiment of immobilized, teenage pining, they're something of a genre of one that's managed to sound perfectly compatible as an opener for both Twilight Sad and Jimmy Eat World. There was hope that These Four Walls, like most overeager and uneven debuts from killer live acts, was a dry run for inevitable greatness once their execution caught up with their energy. And yet, while more focused in just about every way conceivable (no more eight-minute songs with glockenspiels), In the Pit of the Stomach can't seem to move things forward, weirdly sitting in a purgatory of sounding like an anthemic rock record without the actual anthems. Feeling stuck is certainly something WWPJ identify with. As with These Four Walls, the pervading feeling expressed on In the Pit of the Stomach is foretold by its title: a sense of jittery readiness as reaction to the unease of being trapped inside yourself. Fittingly, WWPJ's musicianship sports the tightly-coiled motions of someone trying to bust out of restraints-- drill-like riffs and insistent hi-hats are punctuated by short, almost epileptic bursts of distortion and drum rattle. Despite the roomy lengths and arena aspirations of these songs, Peter Katis' strapping production casts WWPJ as meticulous and muscular post-punk militants at their core. Though they don't aspire to the jackbooted combativeness of WU LYF or Iceage, Thompson's melodies do have an orderly, call-and response aspect to them. And yet this newly disciplined sound mostly reveals a band that has the earnest diligence of foot soldiers but not the spark of leadership. Catharsis is something they just don't have the patience for, and In the Pit of the Stomach blasts out of your speakers from ""Circles and Squares"" and never yields, buzzing constantly rather than building toward moments of rabble-rousing revelation. While posing as assaults, ""Medicine"" and ""Picture of Health"" ingratiate their jagged hooks subtly through insistent repetition. But elsewhere, WWPJ typically treat verse-chorus structure like a straitjacket with the longer instrumental passages feeling just as maxed-out for radio readiness: first single ""Act on Impulse"" patiently works through some pretty, post-rock guitar figures during its build-up to the verse, yet it ends five minutes later without reaching any kind of gratification-- it's just a single with an unusually long intro. The LP's one true blowout comes halfway through ""Sore Thumb"", and it requires a preceding production trick where you hear Thompson's voice, stripped of all studio treatment, sounding like he's doing practice takes in a hallway. I've heard this done on Snow Patrol records. And while I get the feeling ""Pear Tree"" was intended as an epic, exhaustive closer because it's six minutes long, it draws to a close pounding as loud as anything else on the record. This leaves Pit to end with the vague sense that you've been pummeled for the last 45 minutes but with no real recollection of the specifics. It's the sort of thing that can feel thrilling in perhaps five-minute bursts, but the evenness of Pit's landscape makes it hard for me to say which five minutes that is. Admittedly, it's easy to be a sucker for Thompson's Edinburgh accent and to assume it lends a wizened gravitas to his grief over enlisting in ""an army that only fights boredom"" and painting rainbows black. But unlike the rangy vocals of benefactors like Scott Hutchison and James Graham, there's something wooden about Thompson's intonation that betrays his hot-blooded emotional state. For the most part, WWPJ show up to each track with the same bundle of nervous energy and simply churn until they wear themselves out. Though Thompson's plaintive wails and the brawny playing of the rhythm section give the impression of relentless and differentiable activity, they're holding patterns all the same.","The Scottish band brought to notice by Frightened Rabbit continues to aim for sky-scraping anthems on its second full-length, but it still seems weirdly stuck in place.

Monkeytown,Modeselektor,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13ab1335d7bf169a247/1:1/w_160/c66ffc4e.jpg,2011-10-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15867-modeselektor-monkeytown/,Monkeytown,"With their last couple of albums, Modeselektor have proved themselves artists with a range of far-flung good ideas that just can't seem to coalesce into one big concept. But if the Berlin duo has never been entirely easy to categorize-- hip-hop with techno sensibilities or vice-versa, with recent forays into all-purpose et cetera-step (Modeselektion Vol. 01)-- it helps quite a bit that they've never been self-serious purists. As it happens, their new album, Monkeytown, should benefit from the fact that there's still a boom market for nebulously connected circles of ""bass music."" Listening selectively, it's pretty easy to hear Modeselektor picking up on some post-Flying Lotus signifiers. Opener ""Blue Clouds"" seeps out like a slightly more placid take on Cosmogramma highlight ""...And the World Laughs With You"", swapping out its frantic, future-junglist breaks for a less-cluttered rhythm and letting the synths simmer instead of boil. Busdriver feature ""Pretentious Friends"" rides off a buzzing throb that fits the MC's wiseass art-rap credentials well, though the most interesting sonic tweaks-- and maybe the most disorienting ones-- are all the hitches and hiccups and pitch-warps that they embed into his voice, like a mangled stretch of magnetic tape that can't quite find the right tracking. ""Humanized"" is a nauseatingly wobbly Anti-Pop Consortium team-up teeming with winking, retro-space-age analog noise. And the highest-profile cosign comes in the form of Thom Yorke; ""Shipwreck"" and ""This"" highlight his ability to sound more emotionally compelling the more his voice is dissected. The former track's ramped-up, nervous-twitch ambience and the latter's massive yet isolated empty-arena echo both loop snatches of half-formed words and phrases into hypnotic swells that are bobbed and tossed by roiling, skittering rhythms-- it's heady stuff, easy to sink into. But don't look for that sort of Brainfeeder-like atmosphere to run through the whole album-- there are more than a few tracks that refuse to let Monkeytown be defined by a single operating motive. ""Evil Twin"" in particular busts out a more straightforward take on techno, bumping a 4/4 beat that's as upfront as some of the glitchier tracks are evasive. ""German Clap"" flirts with UK-funky rhythms in a way that seems to beg from a titular scene of its own, ascending synth chords clashing against descending, liquid-burble bass. The club tracks, the more experimental IDM-skewing cuts (""Blue Chords""), and the Yorke collaborations form their own kinds of peaks, but Modeselektor pull off accessible, pop-friendly stuff just as well. Hearing Miss Platinum go from disconnected voice-chopping to euphorically harmonizing with herself on ""Berlin"" gives the slow-ride electro-R&B groove some real gravity, especially when all those parts finally reassemble into her untouched human voice for the hook. And even if the delicate melodrama of ""Green Light Go"" seems a bit too self-serious amidst an otherwise playful and energetic collection of songs, it still builds tension in a way that manages to sell its wistfulness as something legitimate. The album may be scattershot, but perhaps that doesn't matter so much when it's delivered out the barrel of a 12-gauge.","The difficult-to-categorize Berlin duo's latest record is another amalgam of disparate styles, from glitchy bass music to electro-R&B to UK funky to straightforward techno.

Those Who Didn't Run,Colin Stetson,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b143c0084474cd0c1daf/1:1/w_160/502afd66.jpeg,2011-10-03 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15876-those-who-didnt-run/,Constellation,"When I first heard Colin Stetson's breakthrough LP-- a surprising thing for an experimental saxophonist to even have-- I pegged it to precursors such as Albert Ayler, John Zorn, and Ornette Coleman. The music was so animally energetic that it took me a while to realize how off-base this early impression had been. But while those free-jazz shamans embraced volatility, Stetson is much more aligned with minimalists like Philip Glass, which is to say that he restricts himself and knows exactly where he's going. Glass' longtime saxophonist Dickie Landry, whose excellently mellow 1977 album Fifteen Saxophones was reissued earlier this year, provides an intriguing precedent. Landry was a member of the Philip Glass Ensemble who played on Music in Twelve Parts, a piece whose edge-of-madness harmonic grind is in full force on Those Who Didn't Run. The title's whiff of courageous endurance gets more and more apt as Stetson pulverizes daisy-chained squalls for 10 minutes at a time, in two uncompromising arcs that exclude the airier respites of Judges. Like Bryce Dessner and Glenn Kotche, Stetson adeptly straddles pop and the academy. And like Merrill Garbus of tUnE-yArDs, a big part of his magnetism derives from a combination of unusual music and bold feats of physical daring. A one-man polyphony machine, Stetson sets his feet in a resonant room and wires himself up like a cyborg, with microphones on the walls, all through his bass sax, and on his throat. Pointedly ignoring decades' worth of looping and overdubbing technology, he blows the bejeezus out of arcane contrapuntal variations over and over again, with phantom sounds gathering around the deep pulse. The music seems weirdly sentient because only the continuous cycle of breath pumping through it keeps it alive. You wonder why Stetson doesn't just turn blue and fall down, and how one instrument can make so many different noises at once. Circular breathing accounts for the former (Stetson must play a mean didge) while inventive mixing accounts for the latter. The clack of keys becomes an insistent rhythm track, microphone signals fry into ambient ozone, and ghost voices reverberate through the reed. Not only does this technique make brainy variations feel hot and haunted, but it gives us a fresh vantage on the saxophone itself. Though it plays a highly respectable role in jazz, the instrument takes on cheesier cultural baggage as you move outward, from marching bands to soft pop to Sergio. By enlarging the inner workings of the sax, Stetson demolishes clichés to unleash fresh, unexpected energies. It's like being inside an enormous brass tunnel full of windy byways and slamming valves, at once exhilarating and frightening. Here, Stetson pits the low end versus the high; granular texture versus crystalline purity; deep, earthy groove versus high, watery shine. On the A-side, grungy riffs churn over a thumping substructure of bass and key action, and on the B-side, the bottom falls out and we're transported to a completely different world, one cleansed of heavy metal and drone-rock traces. Stetson's horn spirals through an upper-register series of intervals that seem to be trying to wrench themselves free of each other, and the disparity between prettiness and conflict is riveting. Though this EP plows a narrower row than Judges, Stetson still manages to show us two very different aspects of his visceral minimalism. The only downside for me is that his music really thrives on accumulation, which is to say that it thrives in longer formats. I suspect that this EP serves as a palate-cleanser for the final volume of the New History Warfare trilogy, clearly polarizing Stetson's impulses for incantatory force and eerie beauty before drawing them back into a complex whole.","Following on the brilliant album New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, the Montreal saxophonist returns with a fine EP that shows the emotional range of his unique approach to performance.

Metals,Feist,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1405e6ef959693220c4/1:1/w_160/83ed416e.jpg,2011-10-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15878-feist-metals/,InterscopeCherrytree,"The headline of one of the best Hollywood gossip stories you're likely to encounter this year reads, ""Shia LaBeouf and Michael Bay Got in a Really Big Fight Over Feist."" To prepare for an emotional scene in Transformers 3, LaBeouf plugged his iPad into a pair of on-set speakers and was vibing to The Reminder ballad ""Brandy Alexander"" when Bay abruptly shut the song off. Things got heated, ""spit [was] flying,"" and Bay stormed off set. Whatever this incident tells us about Michael Bay (like maybe he's just really impassioned in his opinion that Let It Die was a better record), it tells us even more about where we're currently at, culturally speaking, with Feist. Even among Hollywood titans, she's divisive. She has probably, over the past couple of years, helped an infinite number of jocks and action stars get in touch with their latent emotions (""It's a little feminine,"" LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times of ""Brandy Alexander"", ""but it touches me""). But most importantly, the low croon of her honeyed, creaky-door voice has become pop culture shorthand for ""the diametrical opposite of what robots blowing shit up sounds like."" And yet, her third album, Metals, is full of dynamic outbursts. There's the chorus of austere, male shouts that punctuates ""A Commotion"", the towering, climactic swell of strings in ""Anti-Pioneer"", and plenty more folk-pop numbers that begin small but explode suddenly into stomping, hollering, densely peopled jamborees. Building on some ideas she first explored in The Reminder's lively take on the folk traditional ""Sealion"", Metals is a record animated with, as she put it, ""the movement of a lot of humans."" Though her least immediate album-- it lacks The Reminder's pop showstoppers or the charm of Let It Die's restless genre-hopping-- Metals is a vivid evocation of a place that touches on fittingly vast themes about nature, love, and life itself. To record Metals, Feist-- along with her trusty producers Chilly Gonzales and Mocky (who've been working her since she was Peaches' hypegirl back in early-2000s Toronto)-- headed out to Big Sur and built a studio on the side of a cliff. All the things you might associate with the area (majestic expanse, outdoorsiness, and Kerouac-sized spiritual interrogation) seep into Metals' sound, which conjures panoramic vistas with quiet ease. String and brass arrangements (the latter of which heavily feature avant-saxophonist Colin Stetson) are omnipresent but never overworked: check out the way they briefly balloon into the frame toward the middle of ""Anti-Pioneer"" and then gracefully recede a moment later. Metals is invested in subtle, textural detail and shifting dynamics; it sometimes stays so quiet that a whole flock of birds would feel compelled perch on it, and then in the next breath it does something surprising enough to send them scattering in a flurry. Metals is the Meek's Cutoff of Feist records, both in the way it eschews the traditional rules of the crowd-pleasing blockbuster, and also because there's a lot of talk about pioneers and mountains. Nature imagery is everywhere: the serene meditation ""The Circle Married the Line"" escapes the busy squiggles of modern life (""I'll head out to horizon lines/ Get some clarity oceanside"") by boiling down a sunset to its simplest geometric forms, while the gorgeous acoustic number ""Cicadas and Gulls"" takes flight: ""The land and the sea/ Are distant from me/ I'm in the sky."" Metals displays a shift in Feist's perspective as a songwriter; after The Reminder she's said she's now less interested in writing songs that could be read as intimate and personal but instead crafting lyrics that read almost like sparse proverbs. (She's likened some of the lines on Metals to ""adages and morals that you find embroidered in junk shops."") The resulting tracks feel universal, and not unlike Bill Callahan's Apocalypse, in their attempts to use the contrast the elegance of the things around us with the weird, erratic ways of human beings. And now to address the break-dancing, earbud-wearing, silhouetted elephant in the room: there's no ""1234"" on this record. In fact, though it's by no stretch a difficult album, Metals feels deliberately uninterested in courting pop audiences or crafting easy hooks, which is why it feels like such a refreshing and slyly badass statement of artistic integrity. At the same time, this is also the reason it doesn't reach The Reminder's heights. It's a bit too even-keeled to incorporate the sense of pastiche that made her earlier two records so exciting. Side B's most exquisite highlight is ""Anti-Pioneer"", a song that Feist started working on 10 years ago but could never quite capture to her liking on tape. Here, she got it so right: An unhurried guitar lick and the bluesy gust of her vocals roll like tumbleweeds over a minimal soundscape as she sings about a woman who was used to moving but, ""for a year,"" set down her roots and ""was anti-pioneer."" A touring musician since her teens, Feist has spent the past 15 years more or less on the road, so it's hard not to read these lines as autobiographical. But the chorus brings in the universiality, applying that sense of restlessness to a healthy creative process: ""When the flag changes colours/ The language knows."" It's a fitting statement about Metals, and Feist herself-- shifting between moments of repose and restless explorations of new frontiers.","The Reminder elevated Feist to something approaching a household name, but the follow-up doesn't pander to her much larger audience. Lacking a clear hit single, the album instead goes for a group of thematically linked songs that meditate on nature, love, and life itself.

How the Thing Sings,Bill Orcutt,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13f5e6ef959693220c0/1:1/w_160/763e5873.jpeg,2011-09-30 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15875-how-the-thing-sings/,Editions Mego,"Many influences behind Bill Orcutt's acoustic guitar music are easy to guess-- the raw blues of Lightnin' Hopkins and Fred McDowell, the abstract improvisations of Derek Bailey and Cecil Taylor, Orcutt's own attacking bent in 1990s noise outfit Harry Pussy. But there's at least one that nobody could've deduced: ""tic videos."" As Orcutt told The Wire, he's fascinated by clips ""made by people... who have these involuntary physical and verbal tics, and they actually document their symptoms and put the videos up on YouTube."" It's an odd inspiration, but one that says a lot about his playing style, which Orcutt himself likens to hiccuping. His wiry plucks and messy note clusters come in exhilarating fits and starts, so fast and impetuous that his guitar strings seem hard-wired to his firing neurons. His obsessive repetition is less about creating studied mantras than capturing the primal power of involuntary impulse. That goal is reflected in the title of his second acoustic album, How the Thing Sings. It implies that Orcutt would rather document his muse than control it, letting the flow of his spilling ideas be the thing that sings. This approach gives his music a distinct immediacy, something like a waterfall of consciousness rather than a stream. And its rapid, irregular heartbeat creates an urgency that commands attention. You may not love all the moves Orcutt makes, but together they quicken your pulse and pressurize the atmosphere, much as a good horror film makes even calm moments seem one second away from shock. Such tension allows Orcutt to venture into all kinds of territory without hitting lulls. Often he'll veer from plaintive strums to lone plucks, then into torrents so hyperactive they sound overdubbed, even though How the Thing Sings was recorded in single takes with a single room mic. This forceful jamming together of moods results in overlapping narrative arcs. In ""The Visible Bosom"", sandy chords give way to halting minimalism, only to smash into lightning bolts of string strangling accompanied by Orcutt's possessed moans. That sound collage is stretched to epic proportions on closer ""A Line from Ol' Man River"", which fuses together so many hectic ups and downs that calling it a rollercoaster would be an understatement. The same is true of How the Thing Sings as a whole. It's tempting to focus solely on the adrenaline rush of Orcutt's playing, and let it all fly by like a stoner zoning out to Jackson Pollock's splattery paintings or Stan Brakhage's color-filled abstract films. That's a fine way to experience Orcutt's music, but there also seems to be a lot of intense thought going on behind his impulsive acoustic clatter. Maybe that's why his solo acoustic work has so far had a lot more staying power than the fleeting pleasures of a single trip.","The one-time guitarist for 1990s noise-rock outfit Harry Pussy returns with a fascinating and unpredictable album of solo acoustic guitar.

WAND,Craig Wedren,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13cb1335d7bf169a24b/1:1/w_160/8db9c4d0.jpg,2011-09-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15872-craig-wedren-wand-76/,Nerveland,"Shudder to Think's Pony Express Record remains one of the strangest artifacts of the post-Nirvana major-label gold rush, a nugget of operatic, sinister, and gleefully self-aware art punk released at the peak of male angst-driven grungemania. Even the band's unexpected 2008 reunion was both of and against its time, a beacon of clear-eyed virtuosity and precision amidst an encroaching tide of gauzy 1990s nostalgia. The reunited Shudder to Think toured sporadically for a couple of years, released a live album (2009's Live From Home), and once again disbanded. WAND is Shudder to Think singer Craig Wedren's first album since he got the band back together, and it is exactly the album you'd hope somebody would make after reengaging with complex, dynamic music. While 2005's Lapland was stately and muted in its execution, WAND is falling all over itself with ideas. Wedren's voice commands rising and receding string sections, intricate multi-part harmonies, and subtle electronic textures that bloom into full-on rock arrangements. The album's title is apt; though Wedren is joined by a formidable cast of supporting players, much of the record feels conjured out of thin air. Wedren possesses one of those rare rock voices that is both distinctive and versatile, and he covers a good deal of expressive ground on WAND. On Lapland, Wedren was able to coax a surprising amount of understated sweetness from his voice. Here, Wedren combines that sweetness with the eerie trills of Shudder to Think and the glammy vamp of his pre-Lapland quasi-dance project, Baby. The resulting cognitive dissonance is one of WAND's greatest assets; the opening verse of ""Make Me Hurt You"" might be the most irresistibly catchy and unabashedly Classic Pop thing Wedren has ever recorded, but the song's titular chorus proves, uh, awkward to sing along with. Thankfully, no such reservations are present in Wedren himself. The man seems to be having an absolute blast here; his mugging, cursing, strutting, cooing, and wailing make for the most exhilarating moments on WAND. At his best, Wedren spins incongruous-seeming sounds and gestures into shapely songs, buttressed by smart, lively arrangements. On WAND's weaker tracks, these arrangements seem to follow a logic of their own, building and shifting cleverly around songs that don't really stick. A lot of time (and, presumably, a lot of pent-up creativity) went into this record, but the best songs here feel as tight and spontaneous as Shudder to Think, even when the multi-tracked instrumentation is dense and meticulous. Shudder to Think fans who were disappointed by the relative timidity of Lapland should find a lot to love about WAND. The bangers here are true goddamn bangers, and even the draggy stretches have their moments. But it would be unfair to call this a return to form. WAND builds upon aesthetics that Wedren has played with throughout his career, including the understated pop of Lapland.  Taking the long view, the fact that WAND feels a bit overstuffed is more exciting than it is disappointing; 17 years after releasing a classic album, Craig Wedren could do a lot worse than some young man's problems.","The Shudder to Think singer's first solo album since he got his old band back together is exactly the album you'd hope somebody would make after reengaging with complex, dynamic music.

Cole World: The Sideline Story,J. Cole,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1445e6ef959693220cd/1:1/w_160/b10c0781.jpeg,2011-09-30 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15879-j-cole-cole-world-the-sideline-story/,ColumbiaRoc Nation,"J. Cole is the kind of rapper who worries aloud, and frequently, if he's getting too deep for his own songs. A St. John's University magna cum laude graduate raised in poverty by a single mother, Cole distinguished himself in his early career as much through effort as talent. Over a string of fiercely earnest, frequently impressive mixtapes, he rapped in writerly thickets in which the semicolons and embedded clauses were audible, and he produced all his own tracks. He became a leading light of the conscious-rap crowd, who, always eager for a viable mainstream entrant in rap's ongoing culture wars, fervently embraced him. And then, perhaps inevitably, Jay-Z swooped down and signed him. The resulting major-label debut, Cole World: The Sideline Story, which finally saw release this week, is shaping up to be an actual Big Moment for Cole: Despite a tepid radio presence, it is projected to sell nearly 250,000 copies. Those are startling first-week numbers for a new rapper these days, and they assure that J. Cole will get at least a partial promenade through the spotlight. People appear to care deeply about this guy. But it's difficult to imagine why from the evidence of this studiously bland and compromise-riddled record, which seems to be searching for the meeting point of every conceivable middle. About half the album bears Cole's production signature: a glimmering update on 1990s jazz-rap, spiked with live-sounding boom-bap drums. As a rap aesthetic, it's about as rigidly conservative as they come. But Cole is admirably committed to it, and he fleshes it out with surprising musical detail-- backup vocals, comping jazz guitars, lots and lots of grand piano. The songs that stick to this template feel warm, pleasant, and Cole-ish. The rest of Cole World is a 2011-era pop-rap project with a varying success rate: the madcap, syncopated single ""Can't Get Enough"" feels like a lost transmission from 2002-era rap radio, and it succeeds only insofar as it compels you to imagine how much better an '03-era T.I., or even N.O.R.E., would have finessed the beat than does Cole, who deflates the track's bounce. It doesn't help that Cole brings the least-flavorful bars of his career to his debut, aiming, most likely, for something more universal than his diaristic mixtapes. The few glints we get of his personal life are intriguing: ""Lost Ones"" is a slippery and well-conceived, two-sided argument between Cole and his baby mother over whether they will keep the child. ""Breakdown"" affectingly recounts his late-in-life reunion with his father. But otherwise he seems to be playing by implied, major-label debut rules: keep it simple, slow it down, don't lose anyone. The result is like glutinous paste that results from mashing together Drake, Kanye, and Big K.R.I.T. and straining out what makes them interesting. Jay himself, the benefactor figure, pops up twice, and both times his presence subtly undermines the marquee star. On his guest verse for ""Mr. Nice Watch,"" he flexes his double -time flow and coolly blows Cole out of the water. He's heard again on the intro to ""Rise and Shine,"" musing in a sampled snippet from his 2000 concert film Backstage on his ideal signee: rapping over his breakfast cereal, gunning for Jay's own spot. ""I'mma find him, though, and sign him; I don't want no problems,"" he says and there is a startlingly predatory ring to his laugh. J. Cole certainly posed no threat to Jay-Z's crown; he's too humble and lacks charisma. But maybe the next up-and-coming rapper to successfully forge and remain in his own lane is the one who refuses Jay's help.","After a string of promising mixtapes, rapper J. Cole was signed by Jay-Z and now returns with his major-label debut. Jay guests here and inadvertently highlights exactly where Cole comes up short.

Everything Is Boring & Everyone Is a Fucking Liar,Spank Rock,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11bc0084474cd0c1d68/1:1/w_160/59d2734e.jpg,2011-09-30 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15845-spank-rock-everything-is-boring-and-everyone-is-a-fucking-liar/,Bad Blood,"Remember when everyone was having panic-attack cred-spasms over skinny-jeans rap? Thinkpieces about indie appropriation, flame wars about ""real hip-hop,"" stock insults hefted toward Billyburg trusties-- good times, right? Well, not every pioneer goes unrewarded. Five years after the Diplo-sanctioned fuck-bass shtick of Spank Rock's YoYoYoYoYo set critics' brows furrowing, there's a lucrative boom in party music that turns the once-communal dancefloor/club experience into overblown swag-level competitions between Red Bull-addled alpha males. And if you push hyperactive pussy-popping anthems to enough well-meaning lefty skeptics who are otherwise hesitant to buy into strip-club chic, eventually that noise will ricochet its way toward the mainstream. Anything that skeevy to the point of being problematic has to have real transgressive pop cred, right? So waiting a good half-decade between the debut and the follow-up shouldn't matter too much. Not with an updated production sound and some choice gigs sharing bills with Ke$ha and LMFAO to back the sophomore effort. The beats on this new album signal a shift in emphasis from Spank Rock as self-contained Hollertronix-satellite rapper/producer group to Spank Rock as MC showcase, with YoYoYoYoYo's sonic architect XXXChange taking a backseat to a new palette heavy on German electro-scuzz specialist Boys Noize. It all bumps distractingly enough, sure. The opening salvo of ""Ta Da"" builds off a decent swath of plink-thump minimalism that serves as a little early snap-music nostalgia, and the Santigold-boosted ""Car Song"" pulls off a good mixture of jittery, late-nite, uptempo, indie dance-punk bombast. Even the token sop to indie-punk, the Death Set collaboration ""Energy"", has a neat interpolation of the break from Can's ""Vitamin C"" underpinning its bursts of freakout rock. The worst you can say about the production is that it can be sort of anonymous-- there's a song called ""#1 Hit"", and I bet you know what it sounds like without listening-- but it's nominally the sort of stuff an engaging presence on the mic can overcome. Which brings us to the problem of Spank Rock himself. After originally carrying himself like a smartassed joker on the debut, he now comes across as someone more ambivalently unserious. Everything Is Boring & Everyone Is a Fucking Liar is the title, and maybe the easiest joke on the whole album: the cynical veneer on a loosely bundled collection of bass-rap tics that are delivered from a vantage point you can't quite see. There's no point in trying to sneak bass music through under cover of irony these days, but the edge that sparked Spank Rock's best moments back in the day either isn't there or flails around without direction. His rhymes are occasionally vaguely political, sometimes intentionally disingenuous, but never confident enough to tell you just where he stands. Somewhere between the rote, my-dick-rules bragging (""Hot Potato""; ""Nasty""; ""Race Riot on the Dance Floor"") and the even more rote, I'm-so-fucked-up material (this is a dude who requests coke in place of salt on the rim of his margarita in ""Cool Shit""), it's easy to hear that title's disillusioned cynicism in the spaces where the actual persona should be. YoYoYoYoYo at least tried to let some of the sketchier meat-market catcalls off the hook because they were funny; here it's just a bunch of boilerplate sex raps that seem a little too possessive to be fun. Trying to engage the pop market with something there's already a surplus of is tricky enough when you're outsized enough to justify it. For Spank Rock, it just gets exhausting. He's a stylistic free-agent with a flow that drifts between Baltimore club, Southern bass, post-Guetta house-rap, and the occasional halfway-inspired Prince pastiche (""Baby""). But if his enthusiasm for genre-hopping gives him carte blanche to work his hyperactive, higher-register yawp into some interesting shapes, it does so at the expense of attention-getting things to say. And if lines stick out, it's usually because they're kind of tone-deaf-- ""now I wanna go west (like Kanye?)/ I was thinkin' more Cornel"" (wow, someone just heard his first Das Racist track). But his flow is either too rushed or too buried in the mix to jump out. What you're left with half the time for a lyrical identity is a hook, and the thing about hooks is that they work best if you can shout along without either feeling like an asshole or hoping everyone catches your scare quotes. If you can pull that off with lines like ""shake it 'til my dick turns racist"" (""Race Riot"") or ""I can make you famous/ He can buy you bottles but I can buy you Billboard"" (""#1 Hit""), congratulations on overcoming the crippling burden of self-awareness.","Five years after their party-starting YoYoYoYoYo, Spank Rock returns with an album executive produced by Boys Noize with guests including Santigold; it's not nearly as much fun as it wants to be.

The Hunter,Mastodon,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1465e6ef959693220cf/1:1/w_160/28f5ca9e.jpg,2011-09-30 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15880-the-hunter/,Reprise,"Mastodon chose the right time to scale back the concepts. For 2002's Remission, they focused on fire; 2004's Leviathan, water (and Moby Dick); 2006's Blood Mountain, earth (plus a vision quest up the side of the title's mountain); and 2009's Crack the Skye, aether, linking astral travel, wormholes, Rasputin, possession, and the suicide of drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye. There's no way to follow that, so for their fifth album, The Hunter, they offer 13 stylistically and lyrically varied tracks. The title references the death of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds' brother, who suffered a heart attack while hunting last December, but there's no overarching thread. Despite the heaviness of that kind of information, the record works best as a catchy guilty-pleasure party album-- there's a song about sex in zero gravity, another about the Swamp Thing, one titled ""Bedazzled Finger Nails"". Instead of worrying about a storyline they can barely explain in interviews, Mastodon put the complexities into the songwriting and vocal harmonies. The Hunter is longer than Crack the Skye by a couple of minutes, but it feels briefer. As the band itself noted early on, it comes over like a Mastodon mixtape. The Atlanta sludge veterans have never taken the easy way out, sure, but they've also never cycled between so many styles: We get crusty snarling dotted with spaced-out moments (""Black Tongue"" and its ""I burned out my eyes/ I cut off my tongue"" welcome), funky, psychedelic heavy rock (""Curl of the Burl""), crazy keyboard noodles (""Bedazzled Finger Nails""), meditative, progressive Milky Way excursions (""Stargasm""), hammering tech-psych anthems with crazy-climber riffs (""Octopus Has No Friends""). Outside that, ""Blasteroid"" could almost pass as Torche. Really, it's like pressing buttons at random on a jukebox. Mastodon 2011 are largely about restless experimentation. The Hunter is the quartet's first collection with cover art by someone other than Paul Romano. They recorded it with hip-hop and Maroon 5 producer Mike Elizondo, the guy who co-wrote 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"", and the Game's ""Higher"".  It also features the first track sung entirely by Dailor. They use a Theremin. The sound is certainly chewier and, at times, more pop than usual. Two of the best songs-- the fuzzed sing-along ""All the Heavy Lifting"" and the slowly unfurling title track-- deliver memorable, vaguely radio-friendly choruses. But there's also the tech-heavy weirdness of ""Bedazzled Finger Nails"", a pretty, stumbling track that offers mathy psychedelia with a variety of vocal approaches (though I could do without the synth squiggles). As you might expect from a record this jumbled, there are parts that lag. Here, they sequenced three duds together, the generic classic rock of ""Dry Bone Valley"", the mid-tempo ""The Thickening"", with its sexy oohs and ahhs, and Brann Dailor's Syd Barrett-like ""The Creature Lives"", a song that opens with more than a minute of Moog and laughter. (Note: It's not a great idea to follow one of your throwaway tracks with more than a minute of Moog and laughter.) They come back strong with ""Spectrelight"", a burnt offering sung by  regular guest Neurosis' Scott Kelly, and the pretty finale, ""The Sparrow"", a track dedicated to the band's accountant's wife, who died of stomach cancer. Lyrically, they simply, rather beautifully, repeat her supposed life motto: ""Pursue happiness with diligence."" It feels like The Hunter's motto, too. I do miss the grit, heavy-lifting, and larger excavations of their earlier work-- nothing merits tossing around the word ""epic"" here-- but what they do, and what they've become, is fascinating. I ended my review of Blood Mountain by jokingly referring to the guys as the new ""Monsters of Rock."" They went on to play the festival of the same name the next year, but I was more talking about the ascension of a new brand of mainstream heavy metal, one that would sit beside Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and others of their ilk.

Cerebral Ballzy,Cerebral Ballzy,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b137b1335d7bf169a23e/1:1/w_160/2ed03c6c.jpg,2011-09-29 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15868-cerebral-ballzy/,Williams Street,"Punk rock has a long tradition of taking the counter-culture vibe that rock'n'roll cultivated back when hip-shaking was a crime against propriety and cranking up the volume to intentionally offend every possible denomination: the fans, the critics, the outcasts, the bigots, the sell-outs, the scenesters, and so on. Some bands had a well-reasoned method to their misanthropic madness, and some just wanted to piss people off (or, in special cases, actually piss on people). What's most 0ffensive about Cerebral Ballzy's attempts at ""edgy"" provocation isn't tastelessness or insensitivity-- it's the blandness. To be fair to these five guys, it's not like they're aiming for any sort of lofty artistic goal. They just want to be a punk rock band, with their own stupid band name, with their own songs about getting fucked up and telling various authority figures and peers to fuck off, and with their own Raymond Pettibon cover art (complete with bonus photo-copier fuzz at the edge of the image, for that extra bit of D.I.Y. verisimilitude). Granted, it's on the music-label offshoot of the studio famous for a lot of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim content-- it's the label's first non-compilation full-length that has nothing to do with one of their shows, actually-- but let's leave the scene politics to the Maximumrocknroll's of the world. And it's not like they're necessarily bad at it. They know the moves (the spoken-word intro, the slow-into-fast start-up, the ""bridge""), they know the rules (the album proper is only 20 minutes long, with only one song clocking in at over 150 seconds, and to hell with a guitar solo), and they hit their marks. ""Singles"" like ""Cutting Class"" and ""Insufficient Fare"" are perfectly OK punk songs. So are the other 10 ""official"" album tracks, as well as whatever non-live bonus tracks come with the various different versions of the album. ""OK"" is about where these guys top off, though-- subject matter notwithstanding, the songs are pretty interchangeable, meaning there's not much that distinguishes anti-establishment tracks like ""Anthem"" and ""Don't Tell Me What to Do"" with pass-the-pipe tracks like ""Drug Myself Dumb"" and ""Puke Song"". This album features perfectly serviceable and perfectly competent, middle-of-the-road punk rock music that probably sounds much better live than it ever could in a recording studio. If it weren't being released at a time when groups like Off!, Double Negative, Trash Talk, and any number of hardcore-flavored punk groups are putting their own individualistic spins on the well-worn, three-chord monte, Cerebral Ballzy's paint-by-numbers take would possibly stand out. And if it weren't for the countless number of precedents that have done exactly what CB are doing here, their faithful-to-a-fault homage might actually seem quaint. In this day and age, though, what these kids are doing, and the way they're doing it, means that their only truly distinguishing feature is their band name. And when all you've got going for yourself is that you're called Cerebral Ballzy, you've got your work cut out for you.","What's most offensive about Brooklyn punk quintet Cerebral Ballzy's attempts at provocation isn't the tastelessness or insensitivity.

This May Be My Last Time Singing,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12eb1335d7bf169a22e/1:1/w_160/4a7930ca.jpg,2011-09-29 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15861-this-may-be-my-last-time-singing/,Tompkins Square,"In 2009, YETI publisher (and Pitchfork contributor) Mike McGonigal assembled a compilation of ""raw, rare, and otherworldly African-American gospel"" that showcased his penchant for wild, devil-fearing church songs. As far as gospel collections go, Fire in My Bones felt revelatory, crucial: those three discs of evangelical missives reconfigured religious music as unpredictable, sonically challenging material. McGongial's next project, This May Be My Last Time Singing, focuses specifically on gospel songs recorded and released between 1957 and 1982. Like its predecessor, it's a deeply compelling document of the various ways human beings talk to God. There's urgency to all good art, but gospel music, in particular, is fueled by desperation: Transmit your message of gratitude to Heaven before you lose the chance entirely (and end up somewhere else). The mission is massive, but in many cases, the material legacy is humble; at least a third of the songs included on This May Be My Last Time Singing were self-released and pressed, in small batches, onto 7"", 45-rpm discs, a process paid for by church congregations or the singers themselves. Decades later, McGonigal tugged those little records out of cardboard boxes and milk crates, trawling record shops (this might be the only compilation in recent memory that thanks at least a dozen), online auctions, and flea markets for lost prayers. That these songs were released commercially (even if they sold only a few dozen copies for local or vanity labels) feels paramount to any real understanding of the performers' intent-- these aren't field recordings. They're solicitations: holler along, fall to your knees, pray with me. Believe. McGonigal's finds are spread across three discs, each loosely organized around a state of faith (""The Devil's Trying to Steal My Joy"", ""Perfect Like the Angels"", and ""All Wrap Up in One""), and while they range dramatically in style-- from funk to rhythm and blues to drum machine psychedelia-- they're linked by an industriousness that feels unique to the genre. No matter how rowdy these tracks get, their creators are still doing selfless work. This May Be My Last Time Singing focuses specifically on post-war gospel, but most of it feels oddly timeless. Rev. J.W. Neely and Family's ""Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around"" was self-released in 1980 but sounds divorced from the era altogether; it's disorienting to consider that this rendition was born into the same pop landscape as Pink Floyd and Blondie. An a cappella, handclap-heavy ode to solidarity in the face of temptation-- ""Don't you let nobody turn you around/ You just keep on together,"" Neely and family shout, their voices warm-- it's encouraging, never threatening. Same goes for the Exciting Traveling Four's ""O Lord I Have No Friend"", which was released by the National Recording Label in 1982. Save a wonky electric organ intro (which sounds as if it were being piped up from the deep end of a swimming pool), ""O Lord I Have No Friend"" is quaint and earnest in a way that defies its age. You can practically see the matching bow ties, the four faces crowded around a single mic. The collection's longest track, the seven-and-a-half minute ""He Walks With Me (Parts 1 and 2)"", is also its most exhilarating. Calvin Leavy, a singer and guitarist from Arkansas, scored a modest hit in 1970 with ""Cummins Prison Farm"", a scrappy electric blues that decried conditions at Cummins Prison, the Arkansas penitentiary infamous for its abuse (torture and inmate rape were common, and in 1968, three skeletons, one decapitated, one with a crushed skull, and a third with both legs broken back were discovered in shallow graves on the prison grounds). In 1976, Leavy-- who, in a particularly cruel twist, would be shipped off to Cummins himself for drug charges in 1992-- recorded ""He Walks With Me (Parts 1 and 2)"" with the Cummins Prison Farm Singers for the aptly named Messenger Records. The song contains a bogus fade out three and a half minutes in, but Leavy's really just warming up, his raspy voice growing higher, wilder. The music-- loose, rudimentary rock-- gently revs back up, providing a steady, rhythmic canvas for Leavy to scribble all over. His message is determined, redemptive: we are not alone, not ever. By the time the track actually fades out, it feels like there's a full army of believers crammed into the room. Plenty of new, privately sourced anthologies have inadvertently positioned the record collector as curator, savior, interpreter. But unlike many maniacal stockpilers of vinyl and shellac, McGonigal doesn't fetishize these songs as hard-sought rarities. This May Be My Last Time Singing contains plenty of oddball finds, but, as McGonigal explains, these are just the tracks he loves the most-- which is exactly what renders him such a reliable guide. As his brief liner notes state, ""these are the songs I'm most obsessed with, that if you dropped by my house I'd say 'You have to hear this.'"" Which, as any music fan knows, is the very best way to hear anything.","Focusing on songs recorded and released between 1957 and 1982, this follow-up to the revelatory Fire in My Bones box is a deeply compelling document of the range and power of gospel music.

Cabaret Cixous,Maria Minerva,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b138b1335d7bf169a242/1:1/w_160/b241df03.jpeg,2011-09-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15871-cabaret-cixous/,Not Not Fun,"Maria Minerva is begging you to think about her music. And not just think about it: pick it apart, deconstruct it, comb it for references. Overthink it, even. Hot-button issues both musical and not-- hypnagogic pop, 90s revivalism, feminism-- are baked into Cabaret Cixous, her second album for Los Angeles-based anti-pop label Not Not Fun. Maria Minerva (real name Maria Juur), certainly has the pedigree: the daughter of an Estonian music critic, Juur studied art history while in college; she contributes to The Wire. Cabaret Cixous borrows monikers from two Juur favorites: the pranging electro of Cabaret Voltaire and lauded feminist writer Hélène Cixous. Juur doesn't soft-pedal her exploration of sexual dynamics; she pouts lustily in photos and gyrates in music videos. Sex can be a tricky subject for an artist from Juur's world: mainly, it's difficult to walk the line between the carnal and political in pop music. (Madonna, for instance, expertly managed both, but it seems easier to err on the side of the carnal, like almost everyone else.) Self-consciousness and obfuscation can be deeply unsexy, and while it's easy to admire the games Juur wants to play with her image, there's very little allure or attraction on Cabaret itself. It's one thing to undermine the exploitation of female sexuality to sell pop music; but in doing so she also seems to undermine the immediacy and compassion-- the very appeal-- of pop music. Juur, at least, has the right inspirations: 1980s electro and dance-pop, 1990s house. Much of Cabaret sounds like Ariel Pink covering Jennifer Paige's ""Crush""-- hooks made to quiver over seasick chords and seasick-er drum machines-- though I don't think Juur is playing the same savant-like memory games Pink is. Her referents are too carefully cultivated, too obviously considered (though no one should do her the disservice of suggesting insincerity). Juur's treatments are like the soap scum: Her aim isn't just to dull the shine of the nickel-plated pop that informs her music but to alter its texture. Cabaret conveys thinness above all, Juur's dryly echoing vocals and keyboard presets hovering on the same plane. It constantly feels like even a cursory scrubbing would make a world of difference. In this environment, beauty and melody are secondary concerns, though they are concerns. It's impossible to hear standouts such as ""Pirate's Tale"" and ""Soo High"" as anything other than soberly conceived pop songs, but ""pop songs"" is a tricky term: these tracks aren't meant to unite, or inspire, or empathize. They're meant to make you think. About what, exactly, sometimes gets lost: the lyrics of ""Ruff Trade"" eerily triangulate sex, violence, and despair, but ""Soo High"" begins with ""Baby baby baby/ You make me so high/ When I'm around you/ Time just flies by."" Tongue-in-cheek? Probably, but I don't always wish to exit my swoony pop trance to suss that out. So you see why Cabaret functions best in the midst of the Maria Minerva audio/visual/theoretical experience: Juur's music isn't yet precise enough to probe the nuances of admittedly weighty material on its own. I really like Cabaret Cixous' sound, though-- it's fidgety and restless, full of love for its inspirations despite its partly academic birth. I'd be more optimistic on Juur's future if her prodigious output-- Cabaret follows her Tallinn at Dawn tape, also released this year-- and haphazard recording style signaled a clearer process of trial/error/refinement. She is not moving toward a more perfect remembrance of or epitaph for dance pop; we remain firmly in the realm of ideas. For now, Cabaret is paper disco of a thoughtful and occasionally moving variety, more durable than it lets on.","On her second album for the L.A.-based experimental label Not Not Fun, Minevera swirls idea-dense cultural references into a sound that draws from 1980s electro, dance pop, and 90s house.

Lost in Translation,Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1309d034d5c69bf49af/1:1/w_160/b6ca5709.jpeg,2011-09-29 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15864-lost-in-translation/,Мишка,"Full disclosure: I am totally cognizant of how this review might be utterly pointless. A rapper named Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire has chosen that for his album cover. Your mind's already made up. That is, if it wasn't already after his searing, anti-everything calling card ""Triple F""-- that's ""fuck 'em"" in triplicate-- or ""Huzzah"", eXquire's dangerously catchy single produced by horrorcore vet Necro, with a hook that packs boundless socio-pathology into five words: ""drunk driving on a Wednesdayyyy."" Such an assault of antisocial behavior would lead to you believe there's nothing pleasant or new about Lost in Translation. But it's a nice surprise how it reveals itself as a comprehensive and ultimately human, if not always humane, portrait of eXquire's consummate underground ruggedness. eXquire's been getting a healthy share of buzz of late, in large part because of the most divisive aspect of Lost in Translation: this is a New York mixtape and one that's provincial as fuck. His cantankerous and bullish flow can be traced to all purveyors of unwashed hoodie rap, but he boasts of a ""Vote for Pedro"" tattoo representing the underdog and all of the alcohol being abused is within the budget of the listener. Casual fans will easily spot the interpolations of Jay-Z and Lil' Kim tracks from 1996 but bonus points if you spot the hat-tip to a 50 Cent freestyle on Hot 97. Likewise, it's not enough to have a boom-bap medley called ""Pissin' Between Train Cars"" stuck between ""Cockmeat Sandwich"" (""if you ain't seen Harold & Kumar, that means suck my diiiiick"") and an indefensibly drawn-out blowjob skit-- he tells you where his stop is on the C Train from Euclid (Utica, if you're interested). That some of these beats are ripped from Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein might be the best illustration of the realm in which eXquire functions. It's a world of post-Wu murk where even the gulliest sounding dudes escape into comic books and hip-hop CDs because girls just don't understand. Even if it all takes place within a couple of city blocks, eXquire makes it feel like a universe of experience where he comes of age as a microphone fiend (""I Should Be Sleepin'""), lays out some deeply nerdy storytelling raps (""Maltese Falcon Pt. 1 and Pt. 2""), and joyfully gets on some Anthony Bourdain shit as an ambassador to his local chicken spots (""Plus they got pizza, y'all can't fuck with this/ Got macaroni salad too, but I don't trust that shit""). But don't think that this is merely a celebration of New York… or really a celebration of much of anything. His focus on humility and grind doesn't separate eXquire from many other up and comers, but when I hear, say, Green Ova Undergrounds, their hustle raps seem to take place in some sort of vacuum, and it's unclear what they're pushing against other than themselves. Translation is similar in a lot of ways to Danny Brown's XXX mixtape in that eXquire's sharing some very uncomfortable and often unflattering aspects of his life in order to fully express just how real this is to him. You get the feeling Lost in Translation wasn't chosen as a title for the fact it's a cool phrase: Despite the occasional guest rap, it shares the movie's overwhelming loneliness and desperation. He's in command railing against hip-hop ass kissers-- dud skits named ""Hip Hop Networking 101"" and ""YeahRight!.com"" should make that obvious-- but when bills, guilt, and the impending sense he's fucked up his life get the better of him on ""Nuthin' Even Matters (Regrets)"", eXquire's surprisingly effective singing voice rings out like a distressing call from someone who might end it at any moment. Likewise, while the drowsy hooks on ""Lovesponge"" and ""Build-A-Bitch"" might initially signal the point where this 18-track tape should've packed it in, eXquire sounds more confused than misogynistic. On ""Huzzah"", eXquire boasts, ""publicist asked me what's my gimmick, I said 'going in,'"" and it's based in truth: these aren't the kind of lyrics filled with punchlines and tricky wordplay, and his fairly unglamorous strengths lie in his ability to pick beats, flesh out concepts, and develop stories. There are plenty of easily identifiable precedents in his tone and cadence-- Method Man, 50 Cent, hell, even a hell of a lot of Dr. Dre-- whether topically or vocally, eXquire covers so much ground that I'm not sure I'd be able to spot an uncredited verse from him. Particularly on ""The Last Huzzah!"", he sounds a little indistinct compared to highly pronounced stylists like Danny Brown, Das Racist, and El-P. The ""Last Huzzah!"" remix is easily one of the best posse cuts of the year, and besides hearing Brown continue his hot streak and Das Racist come through with the kind of quotable jaw-droppers that were few and far between on Relax, there's the sense that some kind of vanguard is being established. Along with Brown, Roc Marciano, and Action Bronson, in a different era, they're the type of song-savvy hardheads whose skills and sound might have landed them on a major label with no real idea of what to do with them. But the freedom they have allows them to honor and revive ""New York rap"" as an artistic framework rather than a matter of geography: Of course that designation was going to generate skepticism when the personality-free likes of Skyzoo, Maino, and Saigon were all too eager to claim the throne. But eXquire has less to do with ""real MCing"" than a relatable realness, so yeah, that cover really does make sense: eXquire is flaws and all, and it's tough to look away.","This very promising mixtape from the up-and-coming New York rapper is filled with booze-soaked, antisocial rants that are detailed and funny but also show a surprising vulnerability. Guests include Das Racist and kindred spirt Danny Brown.

The Year of Hibernation,Youth Lagoon,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00f13d197565213a3c3/1:1/w_160/f71fbcdd.jpg,2011-09-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15873-the-year-of-hibernation/,Fat PossumLefse,"There are a few things we've come to expect from recent, home-recorded indie pop: thin production, lyrics that reference childhood and nostalgia, a vibe of hushed intimacy, lots of reverb. Youth Lagoon, the project of 22-year-old Boise, Idaho, musician Trevor Powers, ticks all of those boxes and sounds immediately familiar the first time you put it on. ""Posters"", the opening track on his debut LP, The Year of Hibernation, even starts with a warbly synth to evoke the fabled VHS glow that has become a touchstone for kids of his generation. When you hear so much of this stuff, it starts to bleed together-- almost as if by design-- and you start to wonder what it would take for an artist in this realm to stand out. Powers has a few ideas. Some of the album's appeal is straightforward. Powers writes melodies you remember and has an excellent ear for arrangement, even if the songs are rendered crudely. They generally start as whispered laments and then twist and turn until they become huge ""oh oh oh"" sing-alongs. The album sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom, which feels right given the small and personal details of the songs, but it strains to break free of its technical limitations. Rare is the record in this sphere that works much better loud, but The Year of Hibernation wants to be cranked. Room-filling volume allows a song like ""Afternoon"" to grow from its delicate, whistle-and-electric-keyboard opening into its grand, swelling conclusion, with a 4/4 marching drum and wordless vocal refrain that envelopes you like a hug. The title of the record describes its world. These are songs about alternately hunkering down and hiding, and heading out into the world to explore and report back on what you've found. Powers is very much an innocent here, a kid with an ear for poetry who mixes striking images with the occasional groaner. The music of the Pacific Northwest feels like a key touchstone, and in many ways Youth Lagoon seems like a shy, quiet, and more hermetic version of what Modest Mouse were doing before 1997's The Lonesome Crowded West. Small town claustrophobia bumps against the possibility of wide-open spaces. Two of the first three songs reference the late-night strobe of the television and beds and walls of posters, and these are mixed with campgrounds, woods, lakes, and watching fireworks from a roof. I don't want to strain the Modest Mouse comparison, since this record doesn't have a ""band"" feel, but the guitar breaks also show Isaac Brock's early flair for simple melodic embellishments that complement the songs perfectly. Dean Wareham is another guitarist with an ear for elegant guitar leads, and the comparisons with Galaxie 500 extend to Powers' cracked guitar whine and way of building clattering and echo-laden arrangements to moments of grandeur (not to mention the G500-like song ""July"" that outlines a disintegrating relationship against the backdrop of a sky filled with explosions.) Powers is small-town through-and-through and doesn't have a hint of Wareham's cosmopolitan sophistication, but that works for this landscape. Hibernation is a record for pulling up the covers and dreaming and then venturing out to the town to see the strange and magical world of encroaching adulthood. The anthemic ""Cannons"" starts off with Powers singing, ""Rolling up the windows of my '96 Buick so the rain can't get inside of it,"" and that pretty much sums it up: The record mixes feelings of protection and safety with the tug of adventure and wraps it in compulsively listenable music that explodes at just the right moments.","The debut LP from Boise, Idaho's Trevor Powers has all the sonic hallmarks of a bedroom project-- lyrics that reference childhood, thin production, reverb-- but manages to stand out from its lo-fi peers thanks to a sense of wide-eyed adventure.

Scintilli,Plaid,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12d5e6ef959693220a5/1:1/w_160/65a221de.jpeg,2011-09-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15860-scintilli/,Warp,"Over the past several years, as European electronic music's moved from its all-minimal-everything phase into fuzzier areas, I've made a mental note of comparing no less than a dozen young producers to Plaid. I didn't listen to Plaid-- British production duo Andy Turner and Ed Handley-- very much, not even their 1999 mini-masterpiece Rest Proof Clockwork. Instead they remained faintly but firmly ensconced in my memory, the result of a burgeoning electronic music fan seeking a group Radiohead wasn't constantly namedropping (scratch Aphex Twin, Autechre), but that was still available at Sam Goody. I would never suggest that Plaid were a direct inspiration for a group like Mount Kimbie, though there are worse things than being a token in the revival of soft-focus, reasonably scaled beatmongering. Scintilli is Plaid's first non-soundtrack work since 2008 and their first proper studio album since 2003 (2006's Greedy Baby having been an audio/video collaboration). It doesn't count as a ""new direction"" for the duo because they've never really fucked with ""direction"" in the first place. At their best, Plaid nestled into the wide crevasses between hardline, dystopian techno, broken beat, and experimental composition. Their synthesis was recognizable but not unrepeatable; they stood out for their casual, unhurried sense of adventure. (In the late 1990s, they were called Intelligent Dance Music because their records had ""Warp"" on the back, and they didn't sound like Moby.) There's a danger in this lack of direction, though: sometimes you exist comfortably outside electronic-music narratives and sometimes you get lost. Scintilli isn't the first time Plaid have stumbled into the latter state; all things being equal, they operate in this mode better than most. Still, Scintilli underwhelms, lacking the ease with which Plaid used to stitch sound together. They're no longer inscrutable; like their previous work, Scintilli contains heavy doses of sounds that rile, pacify, and intrigue, but here they constantly tip their hand. The dolloping keyboards of ""Craft Nine"" calm; the walloping bass of ""Sömnl"" disrupts. Plaid's skillful incorporation of the female voice remains intact (Björk sometimes seems to aspire to ""Lilith"", her 1997 collaboration with the duo) on soft-footed opener ""Missing"" and closer ""At Last"". Their overall sound has remained eclectic even as their tracks grow compartmentalized. I still appreciate Plaid's baselessness-- how I can never quite place what I'm listening to. They're less diffuse than their late-90s Warp peers but far more so than, say, Mouse on Mars or Flying Lotus, artists with whom Plaid share sensibilities but little more. I find Scintilli-- and its ambitious alternating of composure and chaos-- admirable, but ""admirable"" sounds (and feels) like a backhanded complement. I would prefer to find it fizzy or confusing or aggressive. Scintilli is a disappointingly static record from a duo of born tinkerers.","Like their previous work, the British production duo's latest album contains heavy doses of sounds that rile, pacify, and intrigue, but here they constantly tip their hand.

Mekons: Ancient & Modern 1911-2011,Mekons,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1355e6ef959693220b3/1:1/w_160/d2452320.jpeg,2011-09-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15869-mekons-ancient-modern-1911-2011/,BloodshotSin,"A third of a century into their collaboration, Mekons have wandered so far down their own path that they don't seem to have much in common with anybody else anymore. They're an art-and-literature collective that happens to play music too, a small community who used to be punks together, a hydra whose three heads each sing in a different voice. They've also effectively become process artists. The ideas that shape their songs, and the means by which they create them, are the important part; the songs themselves are basically just documentation. That makes latter-day albums like Ancient & Modern very interesting in a contemporary-art context, and occasionally tough-going in a putting-on-recordings-and-listening-to-them context. If you're waiting for them to write another ""Where Were You?"" or ""Memphis, Egypt"" or ""Now We Have the Bomb"", don't hold your breath; it's hard to imagine most of these songs being the kind of thing grouchy old guys at Mekons shows yell for. (Mekons shows are heavily populated by grouchy old guys.) The ostensible concept behind this record is drawing parallels between the present day and 100 years ago. It's a concept that would be entirely opaque without the album's title-- although, of course, with their ties to the art world, Mekons know that titles can carry a lot of weight. Opacity, though, is a persistent problem on Ancient & Modern. A lot of its lyrics might as well have been assembled exquisite-corpse style: ""Calling All Demons"" wanders from ""a reptile thinking its first thoughts"" to the head of John the Baptist to ""a fan-club meeting down the steps on Briggate"" to ""ice cream, eggs and bread,"" and so on. A couple of its lines seem to allude to Oscar Wilde, but that's the only point of coherence to someone who wasn't in the room when it was written. Still, Mekons know when they've come up with a good phrase, and how to build an arrangement around it. On the title track, it's ""I had a minor breakdown,"" repeated as a refrain while a tiny, four-note figure loops and loops; on Jon Langford's splenetic rocker ""Space in Your Face"", it's ""I was tempted to believe,"" howled by an ensemble with someone's devotional humming behind them; on the old-timey strut ""Geeshie"", it's Sally Timms ending some lines with ""while there's still time"" and others with ""try to still time."" (That last appears to be a tribute to Geeshie Wiley, the mysterious singer-guitarist who recorded her haunting ""Last Kind Word Blues"" in 1930. Again, the title's the only explicit cue.) The other thing Mekons have picked up from contemporary art practice is the principle that, once you've established your voice, you can keep doing variations on the same thing indefinitely. Their lineup has been fairly stable for a couple of decades now, and it's hard to imagine a band more comfortable with each other's playing than they are. When they feel like it, they can conjure moments of disarming beauty. (""I fall asleep when I should pray,"" Timms and Tom Greenhalgh repeat together-- she's clear-voiced and reserved, he's quavering and sardonic-- and then the song briefly dissolves into a dubbed-out froth of piano and violin before resuming.) When they don't, they still sound like no one but Mekons: prickly, jovial, boozy, resistant to the bourgeois pleasures of rhyme and tune but sometimes seduced by them anyway. For anyone who's not already a Mekons enthusiast, though, this has to be an alarmingly forbidding, cryptic piece of work.","A third of a century into their collaboration, Mekons have wandered so far down their own path that they don't seem to have much in common with anybody else anymore.

With the release of their eponymous debut record on Stones Throw, they step into center stage, a place where the glare shines not only on their chops as musicians, but also on their personality as a band and their ability to carry off these impressively formed, iridescent soul songs. There's no doubting the musicianship here-- they effortlessly drift from loving soul homages to delicately experimental psychedelic touches that recall the spaced-out synths of P-funk and, more recently, artists like Thundercat and Janelle Monáe. Boundary-pushing songs like ""Brain Ninja"" and ""Suburban Dream"" are draped in sparkling, trippy synthesizers and off-kilter vocals that eventually anchor themselves in the kind of gorgeous harmonies that are all over this record. Carrying an acid-fried tinge, those left-of-center moments are the strongest. ""Legend in My Own Mind"", a song deeply rooted in 1960s pop, is played a little straighter-- the shimmering violins recall Van Morrison, while the panned left and right vocals would work on Rubber Soul. Those nods are played earnestly, but at the same time nothing feels forced or overly studious, just a little timeworn. On the less out-there moments like this it becomes difficult to sift through the dozens of influences and find something distinct-- for a group of guys used to playing other people's music, maybe this isn't such a surprise. Really, there are no particularly bad moments here. What makes Stepkids feel slight isn't the musicianship or songwriting-- both of which shine-- but an absence of personality. By the band's own admission ""any lyric, any melody, any idea could have been done by any of us,"" and it's this egalitarian approach that's also the project's biggest shortcoming. The result is something that sounds like three session players and lacks the presence of somebody to step up and take this beyond being merely a decent, functional collection of songs.","The trio whose members have shared stages and performed in the touring bands of Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and 50 Cent, release an eponymous debut of iridescent soul songs.

Rest,Rwake,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b134b1335d7bf169a23a/1:1/w_160/30f761af.JPG,2011-09-28 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15865-rest/,Relapse,"Voices of Omens, the previous LP by Arkansas doom troupe Rwake, opened with a foreboding, 82-second mandolin meditation, its thin notes hanging like premonitions before the strangled samples and serrated guitars of ""The Finality"" cut in. Rest, the band's latest, also begins with a prelude of prettiness. Here, an acoustic guitar line circles around itself with a slide guitar and a keyboard drone distantly echoing the melody. As with most everything on Rest, Rwake makes this relatively placid introduction-- nearly as much a heavy metal trope as the apocalypse and goblins-- a bit weirder and wilder than expected. As the drone swells, female vocals intertwine with the guitars, casting a spell that seems to summon the band's scorn. When it finally arrives, it's relentless and exhilarating, the sort of inclusive ""doom"" that moves with the same unpredictable force of the Body's 2010 opus, All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood. If that sounds like high praise, it is: Rest is the best album of Rwake's 14-year career, further proof that doom does exist beyond Neurosis. Although Rwake have been making music for more than a decade, Rest comes turbocharged by an obsession with ideas and influences different from those you might generally expect from a younger band. The album incorporates flute, MIDI, marimba, mandolin, stacked sine-wave drones, and loads of acoustic and electric guitars, all expertly captured by go-to metal guy Sanford Parker. After that eerie introduction, for instance, a viscous riff expectedly cascades in turgid waves. That lasts only for about 20 seconds, though, at which point a sizzling lead cuts through, like an Allman perched atop an army. Actually, within the first two minutes of ""It Was Beautiful But Now It's Sour"", moments of Teutonic thrash, Pentecostal glossolalia, and power-electronics din have their spotlight share. The song lasts nearly 12 minutes, and it never starts to scrimp on the surprises. The same goes for the 16-minute ""The Culling"", a sidewinding number that builds from the kind of electro-acoustic drift Agalloch favor into a pummeling rage with twin guitar leads, risky vocal manipulation, and a restless rhythm section that consistently pushes the band into unforeseen directions. And, in spite of the frequent doom tag, ""An Invisible Thread"" races through speed metal, black metal, and hardcore-like blasts before-- after more than four minutes-- settling into a malevolent, down-tempo throb more consistent with the niche. This slower section not only offers four of the album's most compelling minutes (Rwake seem most practiced and comfortable at this pace), but also gives them the chance to offer a sort of mission statement-- a vision of artistic renewal in a world plagued by fakers. ""When all the others give and fucking take/ Users suck the life to fucking live,"" Rwake's B. and C.T. shout together in scorn. ""Imitate life but never recreate."" After all, Rest is very much made with a bleak worldview, built lyrically on references to being pulled into the sun, singing songs of sorrow, and having a sick stomach. But there's a core of resilience here that seems to be anchored to an idea of exploration and conquest-- survivors fighting their way through a tunnel, working against evil forces that hide in the shadows. It's an appropriate theme for Rwake, a band that seems to hold nothing sacred within its purview of what is and what is not heavy metal. Sure, they use a half-dozen of the techniques you'll anticipate from a brutal Southern doom band, from samples about death and the cosmos to calm passages meant to offer relief from and juxtaposition to the record's generally vengeful maul. But for these 53 minutes, they also offer a barrage of the unexpected, relighting doom from the strangest corners.","On the best album of its 14-year career, the Arkansas group, a band that seems to hold nothing sacred within its purview of what is and what is not heavy metal, offers further proof that doom does exist beyond Neurosis.

Only in Dreams,Dum Dum Girls,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12113d197565213a59b/1:1/w_160/9c46916a.jpeg,2011-09-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15851-dum-dum-girls-only-in-dreams/,Sub Pop,"Sugar, spice, and overnighters in dank Italian jail cells-- these are the things that Dum Dum Girls' first record was made of. Equal parts girl-group gloss and brash punk energy, I Will Be paired the tinny jangle of Psychocandy-coated guitars with lead singer Dee Dee's exquisitely aloof vocals to create a vibe of timelessly cool abandon. It sounded like a girl gang had kicked the authority figures out of the principal's office, barricaded the doors, and taken to blasting their delinquent anthems like ""Bhang Bhang, I'm a Burnout"" and ""Jail La La"" over the school's loudspeaker. The Dum Dums might have been the baddest girls on the scene, but they certainly weren't the only ones: over the past couple of years Vivian Girls, Best Coast, and Frankie Rose and the Outs have each dusted off the kitschy cultural detritus of 1960s girl-group pop and filtered it through a hefty dose of D.I.Y. grit. It's been a blast. But even the most enduring of the original practitioners carried some decidedly pre-feminist baggage (baby love, wide-eyed devotion, Svengalis), and at times the new stuff didn't feel too much more enlightened. Or at least it could have seemed that way if you made the mistake of looking for meaning solely on the surface of the songs. Dum Dum Girls in particular had a way of reminding you that there was more to it than that. They had fun with irony; artifice; and winking, revisionist takes on musical history (Kristin Gundred's Ramones-nodding stage name Dee Dee; Richard ""My Boyfriend's Back"" Gottehrer's co-producing credit on both full-lengths) that reminded you of the simple, triumphant facts: these women were all pretty excellent pop songwriters, and this thing they were part of was the most visible all-female front in indie rock since the riot grrrl movement in the early 1990s. And yet, even the highlights of the girl-group garage scene (of which I Will Be is certainly one) still focused pretty narrowly on simple, youthful emotions and didn't seem to care much about aesthetic development. Some time around the third Vivian Girls LP, you couldn't help but wonder: Will any of these groups be bold enough to move forward? Will any of them stick around long enough to, well, grow up? Only in Dreams is the first record of this wave able to form an answer to that question, and for that it feels admirably bold. Spurred by the death of Dee Dee's mother and the separation anxiety she felt while she and her husband (Crocodiles' Brandon Welchez) were touring with their respective bands, it's a statement of thematic maturity and emotional depth we've not yet heard from Dum Dum Girls-- nor many of their contemporaries. It builds on the momentum of this year's terrific and shimmery He Gets Me High EP, but it's even more of a hi-fi affirmation (""It's cool to record in [an] actual studio and use real mics,"" Dee Dee said recently) and an introduction of a whole new set of influences (Mazzy Star, the Pretenders) in the band's sound. The first thing you notice is Dee Dee's voice. If you've seen the band live, you know: girl's got pipes. But you didn't get that from I Will Be, which kept it distorted and low in the mix. In interviews, she's been candid about her stage fright and her gradual acceptance of her role as a frontwoman, and her newfound confidence is pretty thrilling to hear on Only in Dreams. Vocally, Chrissie Hynde is the obvious reference point, but Dee Dee's less interested in aping Hynde's sneering, Jagger-like strut than channeling the lush depths of her own voice on tracks like ""Bedroom Eyes"". For the first time on a Dum Dum Girls record, the rest of the Girls sing backup, which adds even more fullness to the sound. As on He Gets Me High, Gottehrer shares a producing credit with the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner, and they've effectively scrubbed the grit off the Girls' guitars until they glimmer. Which brings us to the problem with Only in Dreams: the pristine production sounds great, but it makes the lack of complexity and occasional shortcomings-- the kind of issues that were easier to disguise, or perhaps shrug off, on I Will Be-- all too apparent. Most of the songs are mid-tempo, and there's little variation in the drum beats, phrasing, or song structure. Some people might also take issue with the relatively simplistic rhyme schemes, but thanks to Dee Dee's expressive vocals, that's not a problem. She's able to conjure powerful emotions from minimal imagery and simple, straightforward declarations. It's not much to look at on paper, but the way she holds the notes in ""Heartbeat""'s bridge-- ""I don't know/ Where to go/ To get away from this sorrow""-- is nothing less than a gutpunch. There are 10 songs on Only in Dreams, and every one of them contains the word ""you."" Some of them Dee Dee wrote about her husband, and some she wrote about watching her mother succumb to cancer last year. Perhaps the most moving thing about Only in Dreams is that it's not always immediately apparent which of these people she's addressing; its state of longing feels universally applicable. ""Heartbeat"", ""Wasted Away"", and ""Teardrops on My Pillow"" can pass on a cursory listen for odes to romantic heartbreak, but the startlingly direct references to death (""It's a game, how tight/ Can you shut your eyes/ Shut out the light/ Death is so bright"") make you look back and realize that there's a sense of loss throbbing throughout the record. (Dee Dee's mom played an important role in the band's aesthetic-- that's her on the covers of I Will Be and the self-titled debut EP.) There's a passing moment on ""Caught in One"" when she wishes to trade places with her ailing mother, but by the closer, ""Hold Your Hand"", she's facing down her own identity (""But she's not you/ No, she's not you"") and finding the strength to begin picking up the pieces and rebuilding on her own. It's a step forward for her as a songwriter, articulating-- let alone sharing-- a feeling this intimate. Nothing on Only in Dreams has the immediacy of a track like ""Jail La La"", so those looking for a retread might be disappointed. But songs like the slow-burning ""Coming Down"" show Dum Dum Girls pushing themselves in new directions-- you get the sense, if you hadn't before, that this band might be around for a while. Only in Dreams isn't a perfect record, but a little while down the line it might end up looking like the beginning of something-- the first steps forward for the band, or perhaps a raising of the bar for this entire revival. I wouldn't put it past Dee Dee to be the leader of the pack.","Dum Dum Girls' sophomore album is a higher-fi statement of thematic maturity and emotional depth that builds on the momentum of this year's He Gets Me High EP.

Thrashin',Total Slacker,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1249d034d5c69bf499c/1:1/w_160/5356692e.jpeg,2011-09-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15853-total-slacker-thrashin/,Marshall Teller,"This year's been a good one for 1990s revivalism, with bands like Yuck pointing back to the alt-rock heyday of Dinosaur Jr. and Pavement. Brooklyn's Total Slacker, the trio of Tucker Rountree, Emily Oppenheimer, and Ross Condon (brother of Beirut frontman Zach Condon), are an easy addition to the ""movement."" They've cited Nirvana, Weezer, Beck, the Breeders, and Sonic Youth as musical touchstones, and you can hear those influences in their scuzzy guitars. But the 90s aren't just a musical inspiration-- they're the band's entire aesthetic. They co-opted the typography and dinosaur from the Jurassic Park logo and slapped their own name on it. They named their band after Richard Linklater's 1991 film Slacker. Their lyrics cite ""Full House"", New Kids on the Block, and Bagel Bites. They have an entire song about a VHS collection and another one called ""Stuck in '93"". It's not a subtle implementation of the decade's many pastiches, nor is it meant to be. Total Slacker's sense of humor is the album's driving force, and it's both overt and weirdly specific. The lyrics, for the most part, are a goofy celebration of the slacker caricature. Between the references to weed and various snack foods, and the record's languid pace, Rountree perpetuates the archetypal slacker character with his nasal whine. The track ""Thyme Traveling High School Dropout"", for example, is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-style branding for a guy who goes back to the 18th century because marijuana isn't illegal then. And the title ""Stealing From Salvation Army"" says it all-- he plans on doing just that after he wakes up in the afternoon. That's pretty much the whole album. Thrashin' largely depends on buying into that character and thinking it's funny, or at least interesting, for 40 minutes. At first, it works-- the aesthetic is clearly defined, and the jokey tone of each track functions as a cohesive statement. Most of the juvenile imagery is funny (""He's watching 'Full House', playing Sega on his Slip 'n Slide""), but an extended 1993 joke backed by a series of ""woo's"" and references to Crystal Pepsi ultimately doesn't stick. After you've heard the songs a few times, the gags become empty and start to sound like a roll call of 90s nostalgia keywords and stereotypes. And worse, some of the lyrics eventually grate (the second series of VHS references, for example). It's up to the music itself to hold up the album, and for the most part, their alt-rock churn works in their favor. The hooks, grinding guitars, and ""ooh-waas"" of ""Psychic Mesa"" may drag, but they're catchy. If that song presents a joke, it's the most subtle one of the album (it's a song about an ideal psychedelic otherworld, and even if they're being ironic, it works). And thankfully Rountree is an adept guitarist. His style is reminiscent of some of their aforementioned influences, particularly Weezer and the Breeders. He uses a mild fuzz to accent simple, elegant guitar lines. ""Magical Date Night"" and ""High School Dropout"" open with mood-setting one-note solos that act as complete earworms. And even though ""Koolz Mccrulez"" is 11 minutes of one hook on repeat, it's offset by echoing psych guitars. It's a nice, spacey cooldown from the gimmickry. It's impossible to ignore what Thrashin' is at its core-- a shrine to growing up in the 90s. Sure, there are references to things that are post-90s, like MySpace and Four Loko, but even those things are shellacked in irony at this point. Oppenheimer said that these songs were written as jokes, but they ended up having a good time with them, so they built the band with that general aesthetic. And maybe that's the most important thing: The songs can be fun, if only for a moment. Their narratives-- sharing pizza bagels in a bunk bed, going back in time to meet Miles Davis-- are weird and silly enough to warrant some kudos to Rountree as a weirdo and songwriter. But even with great hooks and bubblegum melodies, it's hard to imagine Thrashin' as an album that outlasts the initial series of laughs.","From the Jurassic Park-nodding logo to the Richard Linklater and Full House references, the Brooklyn trio, featuring the brother of Beirut's Zach Condon, uses alt-rock's heyday to guide its humor and aesthetic.

Nice,Speculator,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12fea9e61561daa6742/1:1/w_160/ed6a06ca.jpeg,2011-09-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15863-nice/,Underwater Peoples,"In spite of having the lo-fi ""slacker"" label hung around his neck at nearly every turn, L.A.'s Nick Ray is far from a slouch. For the past couple of years, he's been releasing tapes for his one-man project Speculator, taking samples and blurring, frying, or completely eviscerating them. Much of his music to this point sounded like 1980s and early-1990s nostalgia blown apart from the inside. While the notion of sample-based music is usually accompanied by the image of someone hovering over a machine, Ray treats his compositions with the immediacy of a garage band finally figuring out its parts-- everything is usually nailed in the first take. Last year's Lifestyle featured hair-metal, chart-topping pop, and the Super Shredder scene of the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie all thrown into a torrent of distortion. It was an avant-garde, postmodern collage of blown-out pop music, carrying the woozy and deteriorating quality of a frequently malfunctioning VHS tape. While Nice isn't as reliant on art-damaged nostalgic sign posts (it uses far fewer samples than his previous work), it certainly doesn't neuter Ray's flair for sonic exploration. The album effortlessly segues from 80s radio-ready pop-rock and chillwave to first-wave shoegaze and motorik. Ray can sound like he's from the Purling Hiss School of Classic-Rock Appropriation in one move, and just as seamlessly turn in a lilting, ambient piece that may or may not be named after a member of the Black Eyed Peas. There's the corrosive synth line that swells to the top of ""Design"", and there's the tape decay and clanging guitars that interrupt ""I'm a Slug"". What's remarkable about Nice is how cohesive it sounds in spite of the vast array of styles; it never submits to the ""album that sounds like a mixtape"" format; instead, it sounds like the work of an artist crafting everything he touches into something of his very own. This is the first Speculator full-length pressed onto vinyl, and Nice is definitely a work of two sides. Side One sounds like an album all on its own, starting with the found-sound rumblings and spectral guitar line of the album intro and ending with album highlight ""(It's on) Every Channel"", a blaring drone track whose tempos and pitches are shifted by Ray using the tape machine itself as an instrument, a trick he uses more subtly on a few of the album's tracks. The four songs on Side Two feature a meditative pace, the album's final minutes a more glacial stride than the pop-focused numbers that populated Side One. Instead of ending with the slow burn of ballad ""Blue Rose"", Nice closes with the buildup of distorted synths that is ""Sweet Emotion"". Even without a drum track, the rhythm of the song's elements is hypnotic, eventually swirling into a vertigo of drone and delay effects, serving as the album's eroded, dissonant, and weirdly effective punctuation mark.","Effortlessly segueing from 1980s radio-ready pop and lilting ambiance to first-wave shoegaze, found-sound rumblings, and motorik, Nick Ray's one-man lo-fi project offers a cohesive sound in spite of its vast array of styles.

Black Rainbows,Brett Anderson,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b131c0084474cd0c1d8f/1:1/w_160/c1a1a908.jpg,2011-09-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15862-brett-anderson/,EMI,"Back in 1992, you couldn't find two rock acts more diametrically opposed than Pavement and Suede-- the former were all-American every-dudes indulging in cryptic, dissonant slop-pop; the latter were libidinous, decadent Brit androgynes with Wembley-sized ambitions. And yet the bands shared uncannily similar trajectories-- each was at the forefront of significant sea changes in its home country's independent music scene (lo-fi American indie rock for the former, Britpop for the latter), only to peter out around the turn of the millennium. Both bands' respective frontmen-- Stephen Malkmus and Brett Anderson-- have since embarked on solo careers that have seen each go to great lengths to redefine himself: Malkmus as a guitar hero, Anderson as a brooding balladeer. And both had to put those personal evolutions on hold last year to take their old bands on the reunion-tour circuit for the sole purpose of airing out their 90s-era classics, with no intention of recording new material. That last point is underscored by the fact that, this year, to the month, Malkmus and Anderson have swiftly resumed their solo careers as if those Pavement and Suede reunions never happened. Like Malkmus' recent Mirror Traffic, the origins of Anderson's fourth album, Black Rainbows, predate the reformation of his marquee band. But both albums are infused with the anticipation of what was to come: just as Malkmus reins in the Jicks-ian jamming on Mirror Traffic in favor of more Pavement-like concision, Black Rainbows sees Anderson-- after three relatively sullen and sedate solo releases-- cautiously reconnecting with his suppressed pop-star swagger. When he plaintively sings, ""give me your brittle heart and I'll light a fire,"" on the album's lead single, it's almost as if he's pleading for his old job back. That's not to say Black Rainbows is some calculated '92 throwback. As ever, Anderson likes to speak in suggestive metaphors (""ashtray eyes,"" ""a sabotage of lipstick,"" ""burning mattress,"" ""paper cuts,"" ""carpet burns""-- the last two of which turn up on multiple songs), though his withered voice is far less elastic and outrageous than it was 20 years ago. And in lieu of Suede's glam-rock crunch, the new album mostly favors the atmospheric, middle-aged Brit-rock of, say, Urban Hymns-era Verve or latter-day Echo and the Bunnymen. (The invitation to ""come taste the orange blossom"" on ""In the House of Numbers"" is especially McCullochian in its pastoral whimsy.) As such, there's often a palpable disconnect between Anderson's naughty narratives and the passivity of the performances: only in its accelerated, 40-second finale does the shimmering ""Crash About to Happen"" realize its potential as a Stone Roses-worthy student-disco staple, while the sluggish, bluesy swing of ""Thin Men Dancing"" sounds like it'd be more at home on a Beady Eye album. But in the elegant opening ballad, ""Unsung"", and the ticking time-bomb intensity of ""The Exiles"", we hear a boldness that's largely been absent from Anderson's solo work to date. ""I am yearning/ I'm still burning,"" he dramatically declares on the latter-- and while Black Rainbows may represent more of a flickering flame than a raging inferno, it at least yields some evidence that Anderson's once-fiery persona has not been completely extinguished.","The Suede frontman's fourth solo album finds him cautiously reconnecting with his suppressed pop-star swagger, though there's a palpable disconnect between his charged narratives and the passivity of the performances.

Heritage,Opeth,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b133c0084474cd0c1d92/1:1/w_160/df5bb71a.jpg,2011-09-27 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15866-heritage/,Roadrunner,"In a review of the special edition reissue of Opeth's 2005 collection Ghost Reveries, I quoted band leader Mikael Åkerfeldt as saying that what his group does is ""more than metal."" At the time, the forward-thinking Swedish group was still very much performing within the metal tradition. On their 10th album, Heritage, they aren't. For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's Damnation gave a good idea of what Åkerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, Orchid, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (Åkerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: Heritage's 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen Dungen's 2004 opus Ta Det Lugnt than Opeth's own Watershed. The 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with Åkerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece Åkerfeldt says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist Björn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout ""Famine""), give Heritage a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the King Crimson-nodding lead track, ""The Devil's Orchard"", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes. Another track, the muscular ""Slither"", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old Åkerfeldt, who says Heritage is an album he's been ""building up to write for and participate on"" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. Åkerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, Heritage feels somewhat empty. It's the group's most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, Åkerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills. The story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told Åkerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's ""The Triumph of Death"", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into ""a pile of ex-members' skulls."" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing Heritage. Then comes the line of people ""want[ing] a piece"" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as ""observations"" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.","On its latest release, the Swedish band that has previously blended death metal, folk, and progressive rock has moved into a more measured sound that puts less emphasis on dynamics.

Nevermind [20th Anniversary Edition],Nirvana,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b123c0084474cd0c1d7a/1:1/w_160/27425f15.jpg,2011-09-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/,Geffen,"Despite its tremendous influence on the mainstream rock that followed, it's hard to think of another album that sounds much like Nirvana's Nevermind, a record with so much more pop and punk punch than any music it inspired. Of course, no diamond-certified, canonical treasure hitting the two-decade mark can be left well enough alone in 2011-- especially one that changed the lives of a lot people now approaching middle age, with the discretionary income to prove it. After all, ""super deluxe"" reissues of classic albums don't even have to be tied to an anniversary these days. But Nevermind is 20 this week, still a pretty respectable number in a world where any milestone marks an excuse to shift a few more units. The only question is whether these reissues-- a single-disc remaster, a 2xCD ""deluxe"" version, and a 4xCD+DVD ""super-deluxe"" edition-- are that rare essential repurchase that makes you hear an album you've possibly exhausted in new ways, or if it's just another mediocre jumble of odds and ends that inadvertently reveals the flaws and blemishes carefully excised from the original 12-song set. Sadly, both expanded versions fall into the latter category, with material ranging from ""interesting"" to ""historical curiosity"" to ""of zero value to even superfans."" But this mish-mash of sketches, practice-space woodshedding, and alternate-but-not-very mixes does help explain what makes Nevermind so unique. Nirvana certainly never made another album like it. The precocious Bleach still has its partisans, folks who think its primal bash-and-howl is the be-all-end-all of rock, while In Utero stands as the band's most harrowing statement, where it's a toss-up as to whether the riffs or the lyrics hurt more. But Nevermind was and remains an unrepeatable object. It retains the gleeful pummel of the first album while hinting at the bleakness of the third. Yet there's also a concision and clarity that Nirvana hadn't quite mastered on the gnarly-by-necessity Bleach and wouldn't allow themselves on the stark and caustic In Utero. Nirvana began their career with no illusions about their chances for mass success and ended it by seeing just how abrasive a platinum-selling band could get away with being. But when they got their chance at the brass ring, they went at it with a bubblegum band's canniness, however much Cobain shit on the shiny final product after the fact. Andy Wallace's radio-ready mix certainly helped sharpen this potentially no-concessions, indie-to-major leap into an obvious commercial proposition. But even if they'd settled on producer Butch Vig's slightly less slick mixes-- made as a reference for the band and identified on the super deluxe edition's third disc as the ""Devonshire mixes""-- Nevermind would likely have fared well in the charts, since these early passes aren't far from Wallace's infamous high-gloss version. Listening in hindsight, though, they have the woozy effect of feeling just slightly off, leaving you to focus only on what's missing. The box set does make clear that Nirvana honed these songs over a long period. Listening to the various sessions leading up to the one that gave us the album we know-- especially the nearly unlistenable ""boombox"" mixes of early demos-- you learn very quickly that these songs didn't arrive perfectly formed in one sustained burst of inspiration. The hours of rehearsals and the expensive time spent tinkering in the studio shaped them into classics. It helped that there are songs on Nevermind that might appeal to people who've never heard a hardcore album in their lives, who might have even (gasp!) kinda liked the glossier hard-rock bands whose era largely ended with the rise of grunge. Moving away from the heavy-at-all-costs sound he'd always been both enamored with and suspicious of, Cobain worked diligently on his big hooks and decided to stop smothering his natural melodic gifts under so much self-conscious sludge. The key was that Nirvana, unlike many of their indie peers, didn't assume that intensity was incompatible with polish. Cobain's discomfort could be unnerving because it sounded as unmediated as anything allowed on the radio could get. There was too much pop-rock study involved to claim Nevermind as some kind of art brut document of one dude's unraveling. Confronted with something like ""Polly"", Cobain's distress was obvious in 1991, long before his shotgun-assisted exit. But it wasn't the way Nevermind exposed Cobain's psychic wounds that provided support for those who related to him. It was the fact that, fucked up as he was, Cobain still found pleasure in rock's most emphatic clichés and bent them to his own never-quite-smirking ends. He snuck into the spotlight while remaining an alienated weirdo, but for a while there, you suspected he was enjoying the attention, even if he knew that it was all a joke to be taken about as seriously as high school cliquishness. ""Territorial Pissings"" is as raw as any punk song I know, but it actually found its way into the hands of suburban tweens. How good must that have felt, to be responsible for such a thing? Even as they moved toward the mainstream, Nirvana were trying shit that no one would have called an easy route to success. Nevermind is drenched in the filthy Pacific Northwest roar that slapped Cobain into action as a teen, but it's as catchy as any of the radio giants that caught his ear as a kid. It's driven by pain as naked and personal as the riot grrrl bands whose company he kept and as fuck-around goofy as the Seattle contemporaries who both reveled in and mercilessly parodied machismo. And despite the fact that none of those modes would seem to fit together on the same album, let alone all of them, it's all hammered into a still-disarming whole, a collection of anthems that retain the idiosyncrasies of the very weird band that made them. It helped that Cobain had yet to be disabused of the idea that you could be an idiosyncratic indie kid and a rock star without compromising on either front. That's probably why the bonus material here feels less like a revelation and more like the kind of peek-behind-the-curtain that you wind up regretting. Nevermind is basically a great fake-out. It presents itself as an off-the-cuff explosion, a from-the-gut expression of realness and energy in the grand punk tradition, but it was actually the product of a shit ton of hard work. If you don't hold with the first-take-is-the-best-take philosophy, your respect for Cobain may actually increase when you realize how dedicated he was to getting every element right. Listening to him fumbling his way toward greatness on the ""boombox"" mixes of songs like ""Come as You Are"" and ""Something in the Way"" or hearing a newly cemented group working out the kinks in their interplay in the studio, you may also realize that you don't want to hear the missteps and rewrites and second guessing that went into the perfect-as-is final product. The ""boombox"" mixes, Devonshire mixes, and Smart Sessions (early Vig-produced takes recorded with drummer Chad Channing that were initially intended for release on a second album for Sub Pop) are largely work tapes. Listening to them feels like studying every unused scrap of a film classic that someone managed to sneak out of the editing room, which is about as fun as that description makes them sound. If you've always been suspicious of the album's production sheen, there's no Holy Grail here that's going to give you the raw take you're looking for. For all its finessing and tweaking, though, Nevermind is still a thousand times closer to the unpremeditated intensity of Cobain's D.I.Y. days than any of the post-grunge rockers who claimed it as an influence. I defy you to listen to any of the live performances on this edition-- the only essential extras, though less uncomfortably intense than 1994's MTV Unplugged set and less definitive and uniformly powerful than 2009's release of their king-making set at the 1992 Reading Festival-- and not hear a ragged, joyful, charismatic band that makes those inert, angst-ridden followers sound like they come from another aesthetic universe. That charisma is a big reason why Nevermind remains a 10. But in-concert takes on ""Sliver"" and ""Been a Son"" that are the third most thrilling live versions officially available on CD? It's not as if all this ""exclusive"" dreck-- most of which has been floating around on bootlegs and .zip files and YouTube for eons-- will permanently dull the excitement of the Nevermind, but trying to swallow it all might put you off the album itself for a long while. If you're truly interested in hearing this stuff, the two-disc deluxe set is easily the better deal, giving you a little hint of the various stages of Nevermind's construction without wearing you out the way the four-disc set will. But if you really want to celebrate the 20th, you'll be better off just giving the original album a few spins. Despite how much better-left-forgotten material is being offered up here as essential, there's still more life in the real Nevermind than anything that's attempted to replicate its attack since.","Twenty years on, the album that changed the course of popular music is reissued in two deluxe versions. The enduring brilliance of the original is at this point beyond dispute, but the value of the demos, alternate mixes, and live cuts included on two new sets is debatable.

Romantic Comedy,Big Troubles,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1119d034d5c69bf497f/1:1/w_160/2b21148d.jpeg,2011-09-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15839-romantic-comedy/,Slumberland,"There's a great bit in Patton Oswalt's latest special that begins with him auditioning for the role of ""gay best friend"" and ends with a monkey explosively defecating on camera. Obviously, he got from Point A to Point B explaining how romantic comedy isn't even really an artistic genre so much as a strict format whose monetary success is predicated on telling people what they're getting and then giving them exactly what they want. While Romantic Comedy is too scrappy and bummed-out for usage in cute montages anytime soon, Big Troubles' sophomore LP and first for Slumberland is still every bit as beholden to an overt sense of values: If 1990s indie revivalism gets you going like seeing Jennifer Aniston and some other dude find true love does, it's easy to imagine a tagline saying ""from the people who brought you the Pains of Being Pure at Heart and the producers from Brighten the Corners…"" doing its risk-free aspirations justice. Those familiar with last year's super-lo-fi Worry will certainly be taken aback by Big Troubles' spruced-up presentation, but it's hardly surprising: It's not like they could go much further into the red than they did on their self-produced fuzzbomb of a debut. For the most part, they err on the bookish side of the Slumberland sound, dabbling in both U.S. and UK varietals of mope-pop while producer Mitch Easter (Murmur, Let's Active) shows a steady hand letting the ringing guitar leads and Alex Craig and Ian Drennan's hushed vocals exist in a soft and appealing glow. But while I don't blame Big Troubles for reaching out to Easter, together they overshoot the mark and ultimately Romantic Comedy often feels like it's uncomfortable using language and volume more suitable for the library. Single ""Misery"" is certainly the pluckiest of the bunch and has inspired a few mentions of the Smashing Pumpkins, which is on point if you can find me the pre-Adore singles without the searing guitar work, cathartic lyrics, studio polish, or Jimmy Chamberlin on the drums. A nice major-thirds riff complementing a boyish, breathy vocal only gets you to the point of Silversun Pickups. It's a rare record of this sort that makes you think, ""If only they raged as hard as Belong does,"" but Romantic Comedy innocuously charms instead of breaking hearts or breaking anything really-- even the feedback-laced, vaguely glammy ""Time Bomb"" can't achieve the kind of escape velocity required to get them out of sounding like a rock band that doesn't actually rock. Still, they're precocious songwriters who know from a good hook: If you can get past its title rhyming with ""bad world,"" ""Sad Girls"" is a exceedingly catchy Britpop genre exercise, though the big key change sounds like them pressing too hard for extra credit. Likewise, ""Softer Than Science"" and ""Never Mine"" have a gorgeous shimmer and propulsion that similarly gets over some remarkably rudimentary ""mine""/""mind"" rhyme schemes. I suppose you can find the economy of the lyrics to be endearing, but it makes their awkward attempt at purple social critique on ""Make It Work""-- ""such little relevance in the perfumes of high culture""-- sound like they might be making fun of the National or something. More typically, Romantic Comedy earns its title from Craig and Drennan's narrators mostly dealing with relationships that are ultimately doomed if they even get past the point of premature negation. It's perfectly fine for a half hour of commiseration or wish fulfillment for romantics who take their loneliness as evidence of their humanity: a treatise on the utter futility of heterosexual relations stems from a glossy magazine ad on ""She Smiles for Pictures"" (sort of a simplified, non-academic version of Jawbox's ""Savory""), ""Engine"" wistfully reminisces of after-school heavy petting (sort of a simplified version of Death Cab's ""We Looked Like Giants""), and ""Minor Keys"" goes metacritical in its study of pop's emotional manipulation (very much a simplified version of the Smiths' ""Rubber Ring""). Of course, it's a bouncy piece of jangle pop referencing something other than itself, and that's Romantic Comedy writ small, appealing and in tune with admirable influences but ultimately lacking the sort of unpredictability or drama that can make these the songs that saved your life rather than reminiscent of ones that can.","Following on their murky lo-fi debut, the New Jersey quartet returns with a Mitch Easter-produced debut for Slumberland that draws on indie rock touches from Death Cab to the Smiths to Smashing Pumpkins.

Breakers,Gem Club,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11c13d197565213a597/1:1/w_160/68beb72a.jpeg,2011-09-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15846-gem-club-breakers/,Hardly Art,"Gem Club is an exclusive society: two people, a piano, and a cello. Vocalist Christopher Barnes sings in a quivering whisper, and these minimal accompaniments assure that their sound never becomes louder than a hush. But the Massachusetts duo's debut EP, Acid and Everything, showed just how much emotional intensity you could pack into compositions so spare, and how much could be suggested with so little. Everything on Breakers, their first full-length, sounds frozen over: icy, quiet, austere. You know that eerie feeling when you find yourself alone in a huge public place that's usually crowded-- maybe a shopping mall or a playing field-- but at that moment is totally empty? This record sounds like a sustained version of that feeling. ""I Heard the Party"" juxtaposes echoing piano chords and a general sense of unease (""No one could have told you/ Your body would fail you"") with the refrain ""I heard the party's here"" floating across the track like the sound of dried up laughter. The word ""party"" feels so out of place in a song so pensive and lonely that there's something jarring about the experience. The feeling crops up repeatedly on Breakers: a sense of slow-motion detachment, a suggestion that there were signs of life here once, but you've arrived a couple of hours-- or maybe a couple of weeks-- too late. In these blaring, hyperactive times, there's something refreshing about a record so comfortable with silence and pause. In that way, the elegance of Breakers' particular brand of minimalism is obliquely reminiscent of James Blake's self-titled album, or even Grizzly Bear's Yellow House. But there's something impenetrable about Breakers: It's not nearly as inviting or inhabitable as the worlds conjured by either of those records. Barnes' voice is haunting and lovely, but it doesn't display enough range to give this material any real emotional variety. Breakers effectively conjures a space unto itself, but it's one that lacks an easy entry point. Still, Breakers has its moments of beauty. ""Lands"" begins with a faint pulse of low-end distortion like tiny landmines going off in the background and builds from there. ""252"" also has a cumulative intensity, and the succinct and powerful ""Red Arrow (John)"" showcases Kristen Drymala's cello playing. The strings often feel like the most corporeal elements of  the whole record-- Barnes' voice takes the shape of breath turned visible on a frigid morning. ""Wait until spring sets in,"" he sings on ""Tanager"". You get the feeling it's probably going to be a while.","Everything on this Massachusetts piano-and-cello duo's full-length debut sounds frozen over.

Get Lost,Mark McGuire,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b126ea9e61561daa6734/1:1/w_160/acf4155f.jpeg,2011-09-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15855-mark-mcguire-get-lost/,Editions Mego,"For a guy who trades in dizzy soundscapes and bucolic neo-new age meditations, Mark McGuire is a fairly intense shredder. On stage with his band, Emeralds, he rocks out like Eddie Van Halen, even though the sound coming from the speakers could blend into your yoga teacher's chill-out mixtape. For his solo guitar work, McGuire dials down the bombast, jamming out on simple chord progressions funneled through a bevy of effects pedals. McGuire has been releasing a consistent stream of tapes, singles, and CD-Rs, both solo and with his band, since the mid-2000s. So he's kicked around the noise and drone world long enough to have a sense of the handicaps inherent in loop- and footpedal-based music. Rather than using effects to gradually gather sounds into a sonic layer cake, he lets his pedals act as an accompaniment and augmentation to his live playing. It gives his music more range, allowing for peaks and valleys rather than a single, linear zone-out. Get Lost, the full-length follow-up to 2010's Living With Yourself, finds McGuire tightening his routine. It's a more deliberate, less improvisatory effort built around frequently recurring motifs-- mainly, gurgling loops and major key plucking. ""I really want the records to be more concise and to zone in on one idea and let it elaborate in different ways throughout the album,"" he told an interviewer following the release of his compilation record, A Young Person's Guide to Mark McGuire. ""Before maybe it was just getting stoned and jamming for a couple hours, and thinking, 'Man, this tape's going to rule.'"" Where Living With Yourself found McGuire sticking to moody, simple melodies, Get Lost inches up the volume a little. The title track uses a heavily filtered guitar loop to frame gently strummed chords, gradually inching forward in volume and intensity toward a fuzzy climax. ""Another Dead End"" slowly builds steam on a hypnotic krautrock riff before drifting into a three-chord progression. Though McGuire's sound is heavily influenced by European pedal gurus like Robert Fripp and Vini Reilly, there's something distinctly American in the sound of his soloing. The harmonized leads that end the song owe much to classic-rock radio. Where Living With Yourself struck a contemplative, reflective mood, Get Lost strives for a summery, optimistic feel. He also takes a stab at vocals. On ""Alma"" he repeats the single line, ""It must resolve, we try and evolve."" The theme returns on ""Alma (Reprise)/Chances Are"". Anybody who has ever spent time with a Robbie Basho record knows that, in the world of mystic new-age guitar, picking up the microphone can be a dicey proposition. McGuire fares fine, though: If anything, his singing provides an island of organic sound amid electronic squiggles. Then again, he does just fine without words. On the nearly 20-minute closer, ""Firefly Constellations"", for instance, his live picking slips into and out of an ever-cresting wave of gurgling drones. It's easy to get sucked-- or, right, lost-- in. But even at his most chilled-out, there's always a hint of attitude to McGuire's music. The album's title can be interpreted in two different ways-- one that invites listeners to lose themselves amid a haze of lush, trippy guitar arpeggios and another, less friendly message to go away, or else.","Mark McGuire's follow-up to his 2010 solo effort, Living With Yourself, finds the Emeralds guitarist tightening his routine with a more deliberate, less improvisatory effort built around gurgling loops and even some vocals.

In Heaven,Twin Sister,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b127b1335d7bf169a21f/1:1/w_160/4f96a2ac.jpeg,2011-09-26 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15857-in-heaven/,Domino,"When Long Island's Twin Sister put a picture of a shabbily decorated dollhouse on the cover of their 2010 Color Your Life EP, it seemed like a mission statement: Here is small, intimate music meant to feel comfy and lived-in. And from the pillowy indie-pop numbers to the more stretched-out, soft drone pieces, it was the kind of record that just felt nice to hear. You wanted to cuddle up with it. But then there was ""All Around and Away We Go"", the slice-of-genius, introverted disco gem that suggested there was more to these guys than just pretty bedroom pop. In Heaven, their debut LP, very much supports that idea. It's a crisp-sounding, nuanced album that highlights all the right things about the band. The most obvious difference between In Heaven and Twin Sister's two previous EPs is that they've cleaned up their sound and tightened their arrangements considerably. Where individual sounds sometimes used to get swallowed in an underlying hiss, instruments now have room to breathe. Guitars sparkle, synthetic drumbeats strike with purpose, and singer Andrea Estella's charming vocal squeak is closer to the fore. Increasing the production value is more than just a technical upgrade-- it lets the band open up creatively and try different kinds of new sounds. And they do that with grace. From Stereolab-like lounge-pop to R&B-flecked Young Marble Giants minimalism, these guys run the gamut. While the sonic palette is definitely a lot wider, Twin Sister still keep the songwriting focus small and detailed. More interested in documenting life's minor moments than the big, transformative ones, they sing about things like recommending movies to friends or having an awkward crush go unspoken. Little stuff, but meaningful in its way. Take ""Stop"", for example, a track breathily sung by guitarist Eric Cardona and featuring a sultry R&B thump. It reads heavy romance on first listen, but that's actually not the case. ""I keep telling myself to stop, to feel if I like it,"" Cardona sings, describing a new relationship he's trying to be responsible about. It seems he doesn't want to rush into sleeping with this person-- someone's feelings could get hurt that way. This type of narrative might skew a little twee for some (and there is an element of that here, for sure) but it's one of the things that gives the band a sense of identity. Also, it's important to point out that they buoy these bashful sentiments with some really outward, bouncy music. ""Bad Street"" is set over choppy 1980s electro-funk, ""Daniel"" takes its cues from zoned-out space disco-- the songs have legitimate grooves. In the end, what's really impressive is that the mousey quality of their music doesn't work against these nimble, cosmopolitan arrangements. If anything, it makes the songs richer, gives them more of a backstory. Because Twin Sister operate with a good amount of subtlety, it can take some time to absorb all that, but give yourself over to this record, and it gives back.","The Long Island quintet's debut LP is a crisp-sounding, nuanced album that highlights all the right things about the band, further proving there's more to the group than pretty bedroom pop.

The Whole Love,Wilco,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b129ea9e61561daa6739/1:1/w_160/f184fd07.jpeg,2011-09-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15856-wilco/,dBpm,"Maybe the most challenging thing about Wilco's sixth and seventh LPs-- into the formalist, featherweight Sky Blue Sky and retrospective-in-repose of Wilco (The Album)-- is just how unchallenging they were. These records seemed at times curiously unambitious, coming as they did from one of the most forward-thinking American bands of the last decade and change. Wilco made their early reputation on their creative restlessness, their ongoing identity crisis, but since 2004's A Ghost Is Born-- still, by some distance, their most difficult work-- their music's seemed something of a retreat from their early-decade boundary-shoving. Wilco's great strength lies not just in Jeff Tweedy's world-weary inscrutability, but the ways he and the band matched those stark, sometimes startling sentiments to expectation-defying deconstructions of Americana. The best thing about The Whole Love, Wilco's adventurous, elliptical eighth LP, is the ease with which they've recaptured some of that old unpredictability: From Being There through A Ghost Is Born, the band's best work has always perched itself upon the edge of traditionalism and experimentation, and The Whole Love is the first of their albums in years not to shy away from such risks. As soon as opener ""Art of Almost"" whirrs to a start, you'll know something has changed. A glitchy motorik groove crashes into swarming strings before giving way to a slippery Tweedy melody; then it's elegant bass ooze and keyboard creep, over which Nels Cline drapes a searing kosmische capper. Fraught and foreboding, the song is easily the most daring thing they've put to tape since A Ghost Is Born, a interstellar spin on Wilco (The Album)'s highlight ""Bull Black Nova"". It seems at first as much statement as song: The self-produced Whole Love is the first LP the band laid down entirely in their practice loft, and the brash, voluminous ""Almost"" feels like six musicians bottling themselves off from the world and pushing each other towards their breaking points. Though nothing else on Whole Love quite matches the exploratory zeal of ""Almost"", The Whole Love's littered with enough alluringly off-balance arrangements and instrumental left-turns-- Cline's screaming guitar interludes on ""Born Alone"", the  gurgling keyboard underneath the otherwise old-timey ""Capitol City"", countless rhythmic exchanges between drummer Glenn Kotche and bassist John Stirratt-- to lend the record much of its precipice-teetering feel. When The Whole Love's not defying expectations outright, it's tweaking them gently. ""Capitol City"" comes across like Hoagy Carmichael for the ""Boardwalk Empire"" crowd, a moddish organ gives the bouncy ""I Might"" the spring in its step, and Tweedy's deft verse-ending vocal turnaround on highlight ""Born Alone"" is as sharp as it is sly. Much of The Whole Love's midsection draws from this lineup's folk-rock foundation-- splitting the difference between Being There's rockier material and the sunlit Sky Blue Sky stuff-- but these songs seems to bend and sway a little differently than they have in the past. The band, unchanged since the Sky Blue Sky days, seems increasingly comfortable as a musical unit; Cline in particular, whose hotshot contributions to Wilco's last two LPs sometimes felt like glorified session work, is both everywhere and nowhere, subtly coloring in the backdrops yet unafraid to step out into the spotlight. Kotche and Stirratt's aforementioned interplay does wonders even on the quiet numbers, keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen mirrors Cline's dialed-down everpresence, and Tweedy himself is still underrated as both player and arranger. Dressed-up with detail as The Whole Love can be, they know just when to it pull back. In pre-release interviews, Tweedy's suggested many of The Whole Love's lyrics were born of phonetic garble later wrestled into verse. That much would seem to be true of lines like ""The Magna Carta's on a Slim Jim blood, brother"" from ""I Might"", but when Tweedy sings, ""I wish you were here,"" on ""Capitol City""-- and then, seconds later, corrects himself with, ""And yet I wish I were there with you""-- his meaning's certainly clear. This back-and-forth between alluring nonsense and open-hearted sentiment isn't new for Tweedy, but here the sharp split leaves The Whole Love feeling a bit muddled. He's a devoted romantic one moment, detached and random the next, with far fewer of the knife-twisting standout lines that characterized the band's earlier work on either end of the spectrum. Tweedy's crushed-charcoal voice is as rich and immediate as ever, and though he brings it on the big numbers like ""Monday"" descendent ""Standing O"", he occasionally loses a syllable or two to nonchalance during the quieter moments. The Whole Love bows out with ""One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)"", a gently unfurling umpteen-minute heart-stopper loosely centered around a weekend with the Iowan author's paramour. The gorgeous, gripping ""Sunday Morning"" proves The Whole Love's second major triumph, epic in length but intimate in effect. Unlike ""Art of Almost"", ""Sunday Morning"" does nothing to push out the band's boundaries; it is, rather, a very good, very long Wilco song, one that could've appeared on nearly any of their post-A.M. albums. But its length, coupled with its minute-to-minute success rate, leaves it feeling at once impressively ambitious and completely natural, the very midpoint mined by Wilco's three or four agreed-upon masterworks. It took Jeff Tweedy years to get comfortable with his place in Uncle Tupelo, and a few more to truly settle into Wilco's first act. After a few years of constant sonic flux and personnel shifts, Sky Blue Sky and Wilco (The Album) found the band feeling more resolved than ever, a consistent lineup settling into what seemed increasingly like a signature sound. But Wilco's always seemed their most creatively surefooted atop uneven ground. So the weird, winsome Whole Love is certainly Wilco's least consistent LP in a while, but inconsistency has its own rewards. At its best, The Whole Love finds Wilco casting aside the caution, reveling in their own contradictions.","Wilco's adventurous, self-produced eighth LP follows 2007's lighter Sky Blue Sky and 2009's self-conscious summary Wilco (The Album). The best thing about this one is the ease with which they've recaptured some of their old unpredictability.

I Remember,bvdub,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b108b1335d7bf169a1f1/1:1/w_160/61074043.jpg,2011-09-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15832-bvdub-i-remember/,Glacial Movements,"It can be difficult establishing a sense of personality in ambient music. Because of a relative formlessness and a lack of narrative-building lyrics, many of the ways artists assert themselves are via extra-musical details like album art, liner notes, or artist bios on the far wonky side of the spectrum. Think, for instance, of Brian Eno's genre-defining essays to the nature-worshipping or the botanically-themed titles of Biosphere. Brock Van Wey, aka bvdub, offers another good example. Van Wey is a hyper-prolific ambient producer-- six full-length releases this year alone, counting one collaboration with Ian Hagwood-- whose deeply sentimental titles (""This Place Had Known Only Sadnes"", ""There Was Nothing But Beauty in My Heart"") and cover art of cold, lonely landscapes lit from within by a heavenly glow, place him in a corner one might term ""emo-ambient."" It's a minor niche, maybe, but bvdub is hardly alone. Ghostly International artist the Sight Below has leveraged similarly sad-sack song titles-- ""Feeling Lost Forever"", ""Burn Me Out From the Inside""-- to evoke goth's mope and shoegaze's introversion. (The Sight Below's also gone so far as to record an actual Joy Division cover, making the leap from mere signposting to straight-up homage). A certain type of music fan might be disposed to see these weepy marble-notebook poetry headings as kind of a flipside to the playful and potty-mouthed wordiness that helped distinguished the Locust and Kid 606 as abrasive sonic pranksters rather than faceless avant noisemakers. The songs on bvdub's newest, I Remember, tend to follow a standard ambient formula, one made most familiar to indie audiences via Wolfgang Voigt's masterful Gas albums for Kompakt, on whose Pop Ambient series Van Wey has also appeared: a wash of sound builds-- layers of white noise, echo, and submerged melodies-- gradually reaching a climax sustained and minutely varied for minutes on end. Out of these slowly shifting clouds, any number of distinct elements (massed choral voices, the metallic pluck of an individual guitar string, echoing finger snaps) might emerge before being swirled back into the fog. Which is not to say the songs are mere static-- a single track (all but one of which on the 78-minute album clocks in at 13 minutes or more) might subtly evolve through multiple movements before you realize they've passed. There are also slight but noticeable deviations from the ambient template: ""Would It Be the Same"" begins as a piano played in a bottomless well of reverb but gives way to the album's lone beat-driven passage, full of prickly, brittle-sounding hi-hat skitter. Personality is a different concern from mood, of course, and I Remember would be thick with mood even without the handy reference points of track names and album covers. From the slowly coalescing guitar figure that opens the record to the Arctic-wind howl that fades it out, bvdubs' tracks effectively conjure feelings of, alternately, frigid isolation and quietly blissful/wistful reverie.","Brock Van Wey, aka bvdub, is a hyper-prolific ambient producer-- six full-length releases this year alone-- with a sound reminiscent of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas. Here, his sentimental titles and desolate cover art suggest that he favors emotional connection over pure mood.

Rat City,Jack Oblivian,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11413d197565213a588/1:1/w_160/56f5de00.jpeg,2011-09-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15841-rat-city/,Fat Possum,"Just as a new generation of musicians is finding inspiration in lo-fi indie from the early 1990s, Jack Yarber has more or less abandoned the scene for a grittier sound that's more junkyard than garage. A onetime member of Memphis stalwarts the Compulsive Gamblers and the Oblivians, he's also recorded a handful of albums under a variety of aliases, plying a mid-fi, R&B-tinged boogie rock that has more in common with Suicide or how you wish New York Dolls sounded than with his former projects. Rat City, released under the Jack Oblivian moniker, is a solo record in the truest sense, with Yarber playing almost all the instruments himself and only occasionally outsourcing to local musicians like librarian/badass Ross Johnson and local guitarist John Paul Keith. These songs are Camaro'ed out, streamlined for headlong tempos and seedy urgency. Rat City is not ironic cock rock: Oblivian betrays no smirk, just a coolly stoic expression capped with dark sunglasses. What should be limiting, however, is instead a blueprint for a stylistically diverse album, one that changes shape and direction almost with every song. Rat City is a bustling, ungentrified metropolis: Memphis standing in for 1970s New York City. With its disco-derived bassline and close-to-the chest drumming, ""Crime of Love"" wields a mirrorball as a murder weapon, and Yarber's cover of ""Moses & Me"" mugs the Tommy James original, drenching it in distortion but maintaining the original blues-pop energy. His greatest reach may be the album's greatest payoff: Local indie-pop outfit Star & Micey back him on ""Girl on the Beach"", which sounds like boardwalk-era Springsteen and Dexys Midnight Runners kicking over Wavves' sandcastle. It's an adult summer anthem with a fall release, a discrepancy that more or less sums up the song's sense of wistful frustration with unattainable people and unreachable places. The downside of this rambling aesthetic is that Yarber occasionally comes across as a cipher, too cool and detached to maintain a specific perspective from one song to the next. Instead, what threads the album together isn't his vocals or even the songwriting, but the guitars. Yarber is a slyly inventive player, deploying concise riffs in a variety of styles and changing them subtly with each repetition. By himself, he's a commanding presence, but he's even better when he can bounce off a second guitarist, like Keith or Jake Vest. They bluster bluesily through ""Mass Confusion"" and roll out Bakersfield variants on ""Kidnapper"", simultaneously enabling the stylistic digressions to cohere into a focused record. They lend Rat City its punk shrewdness and endow these songs with a prickly intelligence that makes what could have been dumb rock sound seriously smart.","The onetime member of Memphis garage-punk stalwarts the Compulsive Gamblers and the Oblivians brings a gritty sound that's more junkyard than garage.

The Alan Lomax Recordings,Fred McDowell,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d0c0084474cd0c1cf8/1:1/w_160/4c7decdd.jpeg,2011-09-23 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15801-the-alan-lomax-recordings/,MississippiGlobal Jukebox,"In September 1959, Fred McDowell-- an overalls-wearing, stoop-shouldered, Panola County cotton farmer-- picked up an old acoustic guitar and wandered over to his neighbor Lonnie Young's house. Word had spread that the folklorist Alan Lomax (traveling with the English singer Shirley Collins and a 26-pound, two-track reel-to-reel tape machine) was hunting local artists to record for Atlantic Records. McDowell, who was born around 1904 in Rossville, Tennessee, had grown up imitating the still-nascent sound of the Delta blues, using an old pocketknife (and then a whittled-down bovine rib bone, and finally the squat neck of a Gibson's gin bottle) as a rudimentary slide. By the time McDowell, then 55, cornered Lomax on Young's porch, his scope (and his skill) had broadened, and the sound he made-- a mesmerizing, groove-based blues that both nodded to and defied his Delta predecessors-- instantly captivated Lomax, and eventually the world. Fred McDowell: The Alan Lomax Recordings (available as a download through Global Jukebox, the Alan Lomax Archive's digital imprint, and on LP via Mississippi Records) opens with Bukka White's ""Shake 'Em on Down"", a song that McDowell appears to enjoy playing more than he enjoys breathing or eating or maybe doing anything else at all.  Following Lomax's prompt-- ""1, 2, 3, go,"" he commands in his high, nasal voice-- McDowell locks into a heavy, propulsive groove, while his sister, Fanny Davis, blows into a homemade kazoo that Lomax, in The Land Where the Blues Began, described as ""a fine-toothed comb wrapped in toilet paper"" (it sure is loud). ""Shake 'Em on Down"" is a bracing introduction to the cadence of North Mississippi Hill Country blues: McDowell's guitar is disorienting and relentless, so rhythmic and mind-bending that if you were to, say, listen to it while driving down a dark road in the rain, you'd likely veer off into a ditch (and then feel relieved). Davis' kazooing-- itself vaguely lawless-- provides a welcome counterpoint (it's like staring at a fixed point on the horizon while trying not to vomit over the side of a boat), while Miles Pratcher (of the excellent local square dance band the Pratcher Brothers) assaults a second guitar. The result is mystifying and spectacular. McDowell's rendition of ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"" (a deeply fucked-up-- if not particularly uncommon-- ode to little girls, made famous, first, by Sonny Boy Williamson, and then again by the Grateful Dead) is more of a showcase for his nimble guitar work than any rogue sexual proclivities. McDowell's muted delivery of the lyrics (""Good mornin' 'lil school girl/ Can I go home, can I go home with you?/ Tell your mama and your papa/ Lord, I'm a little school boy, too"") is merciful; he's politely disinterested, if not fully disengaged. McDowell reserves his howls of longing for slightly less uncouth fare, like ""Worried Mind Blues"", an unrequited love song he imbues with legitimate anguish (""You make me weak and you make me moan,"" he groans, sounding broken). Mostly, though, the rhythm is the thing: With his twangy, piercing strums, McDowell establishes himself as a singular player, infinitely more interested in the transcendental than the germane. Somehow, he manages to make the acoustic guitar-- that purveyor of sweet lullabies!-- sound menacing, not familiar. After McDowell was featured on one of Lomax's Sounds of the South compilations, he enjoyed considerable acclaim outside of north Mississippi (the timing was right with the folk revival of the 1960s gathering steam) and more than a dozen solo LPs, although none approaches the looseness of his first session for Lomax. In 1971, the Rolling Stones covered McDowell's ""You Got to Move"" for Sticky Fingers; it's a sluggish and deliberate rendition, and Jagger's approximation of McDowell's worn, scratchy voice feels both flat and affected. A year later, McDowell died of stomach cancer; his body, swaddled in a silver lamé suit (a gift from the Stones), is buried at the Hammond Hill Baptist Church, near Como, Miss. Supposedly, Bonnie Raitt-- a guitar student of McDowell's-- paid for a new headstone after the original misspelled his name. It's awfully easy to approach archival releases-- and field recordings, especially-- with a detached reverence, at least in part because they were rendered spontaneously on front porches and in backyards, miles from the formal, self-conscious fussing of the recording studio. Consequently, any and all fidelity issues tend to be heard as sepia-toned, ""atmospheric"" snafus (oh, crickets!); judgment is clouded by access, and we feel lucky-- embarrassed, even-- to be privy to these odd little moments at all. Accordingly, what's most remarkable about The Alan Lomax Recordings is its spectacular re-mastering job (per the Portland-based engineer Timothy Stollenwerk); now, it's possible to divorce these songs from their contexts long enough to be properly flabbergasted by McDowell's hypnotic, eager performance (although, should you get curious, the collection is also beautifully annotated by Arhoolie Records' Adam Machado and the Lomax Archive's Nathan Salsburg). None of these tracks was previously unreleased (all have appeared, in one form or another, on various compilations, many long out of print), but The Alan Lomax Recordings still feels revelatory-- and for his part, McDowell still sounds spectacularly alive.","This set gathers recordings made by folklorist Alan Lomax in 1959, by which time the little-known Fred McDowell was well into his 50s. It offers a gripping introduction to McDowell's unique style, a mesmerizing, groove-based blues that both nodded to and defied his Delta predecessors.

"""Witchhunt Suite for WWIII""",Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1185e6ef95969322090/1:1/w_160/4540cb9f.jpeg,2011-09-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15848-witchhunt-suite-for-wwiii/,4AD,"Since it first went public in the early 2000s, Ariel Pink's music has felt like a memory dump. His smarmy 1970s hooks, new-wave crooning, and AM-radio aura aren't so much recycled as regurgitated, the sound of internalized pop culture projected back out, with many original qualities still intact. As his discography has grown, though, his songs have seemed less about other people's work than his own. His first big studio album, 2010's Before Today, had its share of retro references but was most interesting for how it furthered his own history. Pink's older days have returned via a ""one-off digital single,"" the 16-minute ""Witchhunt Suite for WWII"". He started the piece in 2001, right after the terrorist attacks of September 11 (eventually selling a CD-R of it at shows in 2007). This is a recently re-recorded version, but it retains his early penchant for cultural collage. Samples of George Bush speeches and news reports mix with lyrics that rhyme ""Bin Laden"" with ""Sodom"" and dadaist war chants like ""Building big bomb/ Building the bombs/ Building bombs."" The song's video offers even more retro spew, hacking together 9/11 imagery, random ads, and tons of VHS debris, with Pink and his crew (including forefather R. Stevie Moore) occasionally keyed over the montage, echoing cable-access parodists Tim and Eric. It's all pretty fun, both as postmodern patchwork and nostalgia trip. But, at least at first, the only point seems to be the thrill of randomly tossing historically-charged words and images against the wall. It's tempting to let the point just be the great music-- ""Witchhunt Suite"" is intensely catchy, and its length allows Pink to stretch good ideas into better ones, moving from tight jamming to slow keyboard meditations to freaked-out climaxes. Still, you'd hope there'd be more to a 9/11 concept piece than awesome tuneage. On further listens, there are points where ""Witchhunt Suite"" transcends the sum of its hooks. Take a moment when Pink moans, ""the human race is an invention of the West,"" over a cycling keyboard. The obvious dig is that the first world has marginalized the rest of the planet, but Pink's bigger point seems to be that everything is a construct. Whether art is random memories or finely tuned narrative, it's all fiction, a way of artificially ordering things that in reality are much messier. He's also implying that cheesy retro-pop, especially when it's done this well, can be as political as folk or punk. After all, if the whole human race is an invention, certainly genres are, too. Having shot that conceptual hole into ""Witchhunt Suite"", Pink fills it with a chorus that's ironic and yet somehow beyond irony: ""Gonna get 'em/ We got 'em/ We gotta!"" He's clearly taunting the childishness of treating world politics like pro wrestling, but there's something joyful in the way he dives into that isolated slogan, freed from the baggage of its specific context. Afterward, Pink quickly drops back into 9/11 collage, randomly rapping about burning bras, ""mass deception,"" and U.S. domination. But at its peaks, ""Witchhunt Suite for World War III"" is more complicated than that.","Ariel Pink began this 16-minute ""one-off digital single"" in 2001, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, and he eventually sold it on CD-R at shows in 2007.

Celestial Lineage,Wolves in the Throne Room,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b107c0084474cd0c1d4d/1:1/w_160/b203d434.jpg,2011-09-23 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15835-celestial-lineage/,Southern Lord,"In a 2009 Show No Mercy interview with Olympia ""astral black metal"" band Wolves in the Throne Room, I mentioned that, as a byproduct of their relative success outside of the underground, they'd inevitably be on the receiving end of plenty of scenester backlash. (Black metal can be a strange place: at times, it's more acceptable to remain boring and unknown than be ambitious and heard.) A couple of years later, United States black metal in general is at an interesting point. The scene, or lack thereof, is something I've been going on about for the last few years; now, on the backs of crossover ""experimental black metal"" acts like Krallice and Liturgy, it's nudging into even more mainstream corners. And this time, there's more at stake than the ire of a 16-year-old Darkthrone fan. Sure, there are longtime USBM diehards like Inquisition, Absu, and Averse Sefira, groups who've been there for decades, and who will keep releasing strong albums without showing up on your non-metal friend's iPod. That said, even three years ago, nobody would've expected Liturgy to share the stage with Dirty Projectors at a New Yorker festival. (Or, earlier this year, to play MoMA on their own merits, and not as part of a Banks Violette black metal-themed installation.) There will always be an underground, but these days, once you are outside of it, the opportunities are bigger. More important than scene cred and these crossovers, though, is the fact that American black-metal bands-- no longer the punchline of Scandinavian lifers-- are making truly staggering music. Wolves in the Throne Room sit somewhere between the crossovers and the kvlt. Since forming in 2004, brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver (and the occasional rotating bandmate) have tied early-90s Northern European sounds (especially Burzum and Ulver) and the progressive reach of San Francisco forebears Weakling to the Pacific Northwest, pushing the genre into new places without sacrificing its core. (Outspoken environmentalists, they live on a self-sufficient farm in Washington state.) To the chagrin of many of the band's later fans, they followed their biggest moment, 2007's Two Hunters, with 2009's Black Cascade, a collection of less-penetrable, 10-plus minute, stripped back, droning, unrelenting time-stretchers. Despite the running time, it was a pure, concise collection-- the sound that remains after the last log turns to ash in your campfire. Celestial Lineage, on the other hand, gains power via accumulation. (Press materials reference Popul Vuh, the Grateful Dead, Neurosis, and ""Theosophists, beatniks… the back-to-the-land movement, satanic hippies, tree-spiking anarchist punks."") It takes the blisteringly insistent, gorgeously rousing, hypnotic repetitions on Black Cascade and jams them back into the more sylvan earlier records, 2006's Diadem of 12 Stars and the aforementioned Two Hunters. Where the past two albums each had four songs of longer duration, Celestial gives us seven, spacing out the mammoths with briefer interludes. Vocalist Jessika Kenney, who first surfaced on Two Hunters and has also worked with Sunn O))), Sun City Girls, Asva, and Mamiffer, sings on three tracks. Former Isis howler (and current Mamiffer member) Aaron Turner contributes atmospheric chanting of the two-minute ""Permanent Changes in Consciousness"". ""Rainbow Illness"" introduces noisy synth washes, and the dramatic, goth-liturgical chimes of the female-fronted, six-minute ""Woodland Cathedral"", feels like a continuation of Two Hunter's ""Dea Artio"". It probably is. Wolves in the Throne Room consider Celestial Lineage the last installment in a trilogy that started with Two Hunters, and perhaps their last album as a band (at least in its current form)-- this is the climactic, colossal finale. In that regard, the epic, more metallic outpourings are the best they've done. We've posted the ethereal, harsh, 12-minute opener ""Thuja Magus Imperium"", with its psychedelic guitar freakouts, chiming bells, female choirs, field recordings, endless guitar/synth sustain, buzzing shoegaze, and monster dynamics. The seven-minute ""Subterranean Initiation"", in turn, spirals into infinity, layering in keyboards that come off like a celestial choir amid the frantic drums and levitating guitars. They locate a harsher, more earthly feel on ""Astral Blood"", a song with an anthemic, post-punk vibe that surfaces after a windy, gently pastoral acoustic interlude. The 11-minute closing track, ""Prayer of Transformation"", works as a synth-entwinted instrumental for 5 minutes before Weaver screams: ""Lay your corpse upon a nest of oak leaves/ Wrapped in a star shroud repent your flesh/ A shadow child dissolves/ Meditate in a den of skins and straight poles... A vessel awaits built from owl feathers and moss,"" among other things. It's rare for a black-metal song to choke you up. Despite being relative latecomers to the game, and even though they're fucking with the template more than purists would like, Celestial Lineage feels like the contemporary American scene's defining statement after San Francisco group Weakling's seminal 2000 offering Dead As Dreams. Since their early days, Wolves have grown assured, but haven't overstepped. The sound is enormous, but remains organic (at times, you can almost hear leaves rustling). It's true black metal creating its own rules, and a testament to the band that it can tweak something this much and still sound like it's sticking to the script. That said, though it's not the purest version, it's also not the most eccentric. In some ways Celestial feels like a throwback when compared to the claustrophobic experimentation of some of Leviathan's headier pieces or the genre-shifting hyper-speed ""occult metal"" of contemporary Absu. Thing is, though, unlike a lot of that other stuff, it also feels like a classic.","The Olympia, Wash., black-metal band returns with the climactic, colossal, final installment in a trilogy that started with their 2007 album, Two Hunters. Here, they mix lengthy tracks with heavily textured interludes and make beautiful use of vocals from collaborator Jessika Kenney.

Parodia Flare,Tropics,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11a9d034d5c69bf4989/1:1/w_160/2355ff8d.jpg,2011-09-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15849-parodia-flare/,Planet Mu,"Tropics mastermind Chris Ward is a voracious and accomplished student of sound. Parodia Flare is the British twentysomething's full-length debut as Tropics, and it's made of compellingly lush and languid bits of sonic material culled from a vast array of sources, including touchstones as disparate as synth-pop, Balearic, Britpop, dubstep, African guitar-pop, and goth. Ward demonstrates an impressive sensitivity in picking out elements of these genres and styles that can be pieced together in ways that are texturally satisfying and often beautiful. But, ultimately, what is he building? That's the question that gets Ward stuck at times throughout the album. For the most part Ward wants to make pop music here, albeit a pop that's refracted through layers of wistful haze and humidity. Ward sings on most of these tracks, yet while his voice does have a pleasantly boyish, Damon Albarn-esque quality at times, little-to-zero effort is invested in making the vocals anything more than another quietly pretty element floating through the mix. So it's up to Ward's soundscapes to communicate any sort of urgency or momentum or drive. When they do, the results are both intoxicating and memorably tuneful. Parodia Flare's first proper song, ""Mouves"", features a pretty affectless vocal turn, but fortunately gets carried by thrumming bass and steady drums to a neat little hook of pulsing tones. In this context, the track's decorative elements, all its chimes and soupy synths, don't have to worry about carrying the song and can serve their ideal function as colorful embellishment. Ward's real saving grace on Parodia Flare is the guitar, which he utilizes in unexpectedly welcome ways to propel his compositions, keeping them from dissolving into murky keyboard washes. In particular, the title track, ""Playgrounds"", and ""After Visiting"" draw delicate, glinting melodies from the instrument. You spend those songs listening to the guitars then waiting for them to come back-- they lends the tracks a logic and tension that don't exist in some of Ward's other efforts, where less-distinctive sonic elements wander in then bleed away without conveying the sense that they're intrinsic to some greater whole. Ward has already proven he knows how to paint really lovely scenes through sound. Now he just needs to figure out how to best set those scenes in motion.","Chris Ward's full-length debut pieces together compellingly lush and languid bits of sonic material culled from a vast array of sources, including synth-pop, Balearic, Britpop, dubstep, African guitar pop, and goth.

Fatou,Fatoumata Diawara,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1109d034d5c69bf497d/1:1/w_160/d6bd1612.jpg,2011-09-22 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15838-fatou/,World Circuit,"In her teens, Fatoumata Diawara moved to France to pursue an acting career. She appeared in a handful of films and worked with a street theater troupe but really found her calling later, when she took up the guitar and started writing songs. Born in Cote d'Ivoire and raised in southern Mali, Diawara grew up hearing Wassoulou music, a song style that's thought by some ethnomusiclogists to be one of the main pre-colonial ancestors of blues. The Wassoulou cultural area is now split between three countries, but it has a history that extends back centuries, and Diawara merges that long, traditional history with a modern, globalized sensibility on her debut album. Diawara has honed her performing and recording craft through work with AfroCubism, Orchestre Poly-Rythmo, and Herbie Hancock, among others, so really the big step here is to recording her own songs with her own arrangements. She has a voice with a naturally sensual glide to it that sometimes reminds me a little of Sade. Unlike many of her peers, such as Oumou Sangaré, power is not really a part of her style-- she keeps her singing even and steady to complement the hypnotic, cycling guitar parts of her arrangements. The album is quietly intense, rarely rising above the volume of ordinary conversation. Diawara sings in her native Wassoulou language, but understanding the exact content of the songs isn't necessary to enjoy them. There's plenty of information in the melodies and rhythms, and inventive musicianship as well. Diawara locks in with the simmering funk backdrop of ""Bissa"" by playing harmonics on her guitar instead of full chords. The electric leads seem to float up out of the patterns; several times over the course of the album, I found myself caught up in a flowing solo that I didn't even notice when it started. This is how the whole record works. There's no fanfare, nothing is announced. It simply surrounds you with its atmosphere. It is an ultimately beguiling album because of this. Even in its most demonstrative moments, such as the shivering lead guitar line that opens ""Bakonoba"", it's a record you can sink into and enjoy for its sonics as well as its songwriting. ""Bakonoba"" is among the songs with the strongest West African character, and that guitar is a big part of it-- it's reminiscent of the type of lead Malian guitarists Djelimady Tounkara or Kanté Manfila might have once laid down for the Rail Band. Otherwise, Diawara is one of a growing number of musicians working on a sort of pan-folk sound that incorporates influences from across a broad Afro-Western cultural spectrum. It's an approach that may be a better fit for the ""world music"" label than any of the highly localized sounds that tag's often applied to.","Born in Cote d'Ivoire and raised in southern Mali, Fatoumata Diawara moved to France in her teens to pursue an acting career but found her calling later, when she took up the guitar and started writing songs.

Rapping With Paul White,Paul White,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1229d034d5c69bf4998/1:1/w_160/798b41a1.jpg,2011-09-22 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15852-rapping-with-paul-white/,One Handed,"In case the album title's got you thinking otherwise: Paul White is not a rapper. He's a producer from London, a designation that, these days, might bring to mind dubstep and UK bass-- but despite some enthusiastic co-signs from publications that orbit around that scene, White ain't part of it. He works in sticky, abstracted hip-hop rhythms coated in THC resin; 2009's The Strange Dreams of Paul White, one of his earlier full-lengths (all of which can be heard on his Bandcamp page) found Captain Beefheart bumping up against weirded-out boom-bap. Those previous releases felt homemade and somewhat amateurish, a distinction which makes Rapping With Paul White a bit of a coming-out party: there's equal parts mutant funk and dusty beats here, but it sounds like White's first true statement of purpose, his own preferred introduction to new listeners. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also his first LP that largely features guest vocals (this is where the Rapping comes in); White's gathered names both recognizable (Danny Brown, Homeboy Sandman, frequent past collaborator Guilty Simpson) and not-so-recognizable (Marv Won, Moe Pope, Tranqill). So this is a record that depends as much on what the spitters bring to the table as what White cooks up in the lab-- and, unfortunately, the rappers don't exactly come correct. Considering how he and White have a past history of collaborating, you'd think that Guilty Simpson and White would be firing on all cylinders by now; instead, the Detroit hardhead unfurls cliché after cliché and drops vague, autobiographical teases that don't reveal much in particular. (Though he gets points for the ""murdering mic's like Conrad Murray"" line in ""Dirty Slang"".) His performances are uninspiring enough to think that of last year's full-length collab with Madlib, the cleverly titled OJ Simpson, relied solely on 'Lib's beatcraft. Fellow Motor City spitter Marv Won rides the chant-knock of ""Run Shit"" ably, but spoils the broth by getting corny about Heath Ledger; Queens native Homeboy Sandman, on the other hand, basically recounts a trip to England on ""A Weird Day"", which is about as thrilling as it sounds. Even Danny Brown, another Detroit rapper that is having a very good year with his excellent, audacious XXX mixtape, is smothered by the spiraling carnival melodies and game-show filth of ""One of Life's Pleasures"", his trademark excitability barely registering. The only rapper that comes out of this unscathed is White's labelmate Tranqill, whose cadences on ""Rotten Apples"" match well with White's searing, void-creating beat. There are instrumental versions of Rapping With Paul White out there and I strongly suggest seeking out those versions, if only to feel the blunt impact of White's strongest moves (the spooky claps of ""Trust"" and ""Indigo Glow"", in particular). You could take a rap-less version of this LP and convince your friends that it's a beat tape from Madlib or Oh No, a quality that speaks as much to White's influences as it does his lack of a specific identity. Thing is, copping to Stones Throw influences almost seems quaint these days, as anyone with an ear to the ground has noticed that much of the underground hip-hop that's in vogue relies on quiet introspection, stronger drugs, and ambient, eerie beats made by people who inexplicably refer to themselves as Friendzone. The fact that Rapping With Paul White sounds so old-head suggests that the ""Stones Throw sound,"" made most popular by the late J. Dilla's inimitable Donuts, is on the verge of transitioning from old school to just plain old.","The London producer's new collection is also his first to largely feature guest vocals, including Danny Brown, Homeboy Sandman, and past collaborator Guilty Simpson.

"Arrangements, Vol. 1",Van Dyke Parks,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b116ea9e61561daa6712/1:1/w_160/0b167d60.jpeg,2011-09-22 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15840-van-dyke-parks-arrangements-vol-1/,Bananastan,"In 2008, I had the opportunity to briefly interview Van Dyke Parks. It wasn't long after his collaboration with Joanna Newsom on Ys. brought him some fresh headlines, but I mostly asked about his long, itinerant career as arranger for three decades of rock musicians, from Brian Wilson and the Byrds to Rufus Wainwright and Frank Black. After amiably answering my questions, he signed off, semi-sardonically, with ""Thank you, Jayson, for celebrating a position that perhaps serves best in its anonymity."" The remark seemed half self-deprecating jab, half mission statement: Parks has a career-long acquaintance with anonymity. His most well-known association is with a record that, for thirty-odd years, was famous for never coming out. His solo records, starting with 1968's confounding Harry Nilsson-meets-Charles Ives opus Song Cycle, are subjects of fervent cult adoration but known to few. His arranging work, meanwhile, has put an inimitable stamp on American pop, though the vast majority of music fans have no idea when they are listening to his work. He is the quintessential liner-notes hero, in other words, which makes the overview of Arrangements, Vol. 1, on his own label Bananastan, that much more gratifying. The compilation is curated by Parks himself, drawing on what he calls ""my earliest studio adventures in the 60s."" The roster of collaborators represented here is dizzying-- Little Feat, Arlo Guthrie, Sal Valentino, Bonnie Raitt singing calypso-- and hearing Parks' unifying hand presiding over this collision of styles makes for a wonderful way to experience the art of his arrangements; their lushness, their invention, how they provide the texture and teeth to a composition. He opens with an arrangement ripped off the bones of the song it was meant to accompany: a mono single mix of Donovan's ""Donovan's Colours"". It's a gently instructive focusing tool for the rest of the album, training our ears to go to the margins, to pay attention to the filigree. Not that Parks' arrangements need much prompting to be noticed. They don't exactly fade demurely into the background; they jostle and blurt, intruding brazenly into the songs they support. His arrangement for Sal Valentino's goofy zydeco number ""Alligator Man"" boasts not one vigorously sawing fiddle, but two-- on top of twinkling mandolins, a seasick tuba groaning low notes, snatches of saloon piano, and a piping saxophone. It sounds horrendously overcrowded on paper, but Parks has an uncanny instinct for how to densely populate a composition's every corner without choking it. The instruments are spaced evenly in the mix, and the result feels like a bustling table of gregarious friends instead of a crazy-making riot. All of these embellishments, of course, were obsessively layered and re-layered onto increasingly overworked analog tape, and Arrangements, which kicks off with the sound of a rickety reel-to-reel firing up, is also partly a tale told by that tape. Parks' arrangements come through intriguingly warped, as if all the instruments on the track had been fished from a flooded studio floor, and the wobbly, dazed sound world that results, however accidental, is crucial to the record's appeal. The sumptuous string orchestra Parks supplies to Arlo Guthrie's take on the Appalachian standard ""Valley to Pray"", sounds gelatinous, a symphony viewed through a fish-bowl. The Mojo Men's ""Sit Down I Think I Love You"" would be a standard-issue mod-pop song in a simpler context, but Parks' arrangement sends the song stumbling through a haze of slide guitar and bandoneón that feels like linoleum curling in real time. It's nearly impossible to pick out every individual instrument from the soup on these songs (is that a harp? a celesta? a zither?), but the sound world is wonderfully dense and liquid, and it fills headphones like sunlight flooding a window. The songs selected on Arrangements are uniformly fantastic. Bonnie Raitt's cover of Calypso Rose's racy ""Wah She Go Do"" is hilarious and startling, and Jimmy Cliff's ""Sitting in Limbo"" gets an improbably gorgeous reading by Dean Martin's son Dino. But trying to imagine them without Parks' additions, as the compilation encourages you to, is illuminating. Pop-song arrangements tend to hide in plain sight, and are usually practiced by spotlight-averse eccentrics who fit comfortably into neither the classical or the pop worlds. But the pop universe would be drained of color without them-- try to hear the Delfonics' ""La-La (Means I Love You)"" without its nimbus of strings, or, for that matter, the Beach Boys' ""Surf's Up"" without the distant horns and chimes. Arrangements is a joy to spend time with, but it also amounts to a pretty forceful argument for the lost art of arrangement itself, and for Parks as one of its unrivaled masters.","The wonderful Arrangements, Vol. 1 draws on Parks' self-described ""earliest studio adventures,"" featuring a dizzying cast of collaborators (Little Feat, Arlo Guthrie, Bonnie Raitt singing calypso) with his unifying hand presiding over the collision of styles.

An Argument With Myself,Jens Lekman,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11f9d034d5c69bf4994/1:1/w_160/3a56bb91.jpeg,2011-09-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15850-an-argument-with-myself/,Secretly CanadianService,"Of all the loveable things about Jens Lekman, my favorite is how he tosses banana peels on the paths of conventional taste. Seldom does such wonderful music sound so comically awful when you try to describe it to someone. ""Man, he's amazing, like Neil Sedaka with a bit of a head cold singing over the Love Boat theme song."" By the time you get that far, dude is already backing away slowly. A Swedish indie-pop dramatist who introduces sarcastic modernity to the most gloriously moribund styles of the 20th century-- from orientalist world music to suburban exotica-- Lekman guides an enthusiastic tour through the dustiest yard-sale record collections, conjuring obscure shades of Henry Mancini, Harry Belafonte, and Bobby McFerrin. Smooth saxes and indigenous flutes jostle against some of the most quotable one-liners this side of Das Racist. Listening to him gives me strange urges, like downloading the latter-day Beach Boys discography. With such an approach, it would be easy to slip into actual decadence or mere parody. Lekman, a slippery character, avoids both because of his rich, alloyed personality, which can sop up any amount of pink champagne. He whisks us out of the authenticity-obsessed house that punk built into provinces where music more openly embraces the attributes of the actor, taking a stance of ebullient knowingness toward the abundant variety and complex artifice on the fringes of pop. He's very clever with frames, using vocal inflections and contextual cues to pack whole ways of life into deceptively simple lines. On his previous full-length record, 2007's Night Falls Over Kortedala, he sang, ""I was slicing up an avocado/ When you came up behind me."" Not much on paper, but when activated by Lekman's exaggeratedly tony diction and cozy music, it captured the texture of a contemporary bourgeois existence in one gnomic stroke. The Lucksmiths were great at this same kind of evocative shorthand, though Lekman brings to it a slightly more jaundiced eye. Lekman's new An Argument with Myself EP is a compact gem. It tilts this way and that to show different facets of the singer: his ruminative side, his topical side, his devotional side, his wicked humor, skewed insight, and flawless banality. At less than 18 minutes, there isn't a wasted moment. Each song does something distinct both sonically and lyrically, filtering one rarified but relatable sensibility through guise after revealing guise. We meet Lekman the flâneur, the desultory anecdotalist, the affable trickster. You can practically see the emotions mugging on his face as he gets into character, the startled eyes or the lopsided grin. There are elements of droll pastiche, like how the goofy horns on ""New Directions"" take a seamless turn to resemble the augustly rational Jean-Joseph Mouret music made famous by Masterpiece Theater. But Lekman is equally a throwback to songwriters like Paul Simon; gifted raconteurs who weren't afraid to try just about anything and trusted their sweet, creamy voices to make it work. If Lekman owes Simon any debt, it's paid in full on the title track, a sparkling Afro-Caribbean whirl that sounds like a 21st-century European's answer to Graceland. The elliptically conversational lyrics, the clotted backing harmonies, the thin line between singing and mellifluous speech, the existential undertow of Lekman's self-interrogation while wandering through Melbourne, his new home-- Simon probably would’ve stopped short of crying ""Why ya' hitting yourself? Why ya' hitting yourself?"" but otherwise they're totally simpatico. Lekman's thoughts meander with his footsteps, which lead him in surprising but just-right directions. There's a song about stalking Kirsten Dunst while she filmed Melancholia in Lekman's native Gothenburg that works overtime as both an ode to provincialism and a protracted joke, complete with a droopy slide-whistle punchline. And whenever we find our own feet in a song, Lekman pulls the rug out from under us. He uses key changes to signal transitions between social criticism and personal pledges on the convalescence card ""A Promise"", and switches narrative perspective midstream on the plush reggae closer so that what we initially heard as snarky small talk is suddenly bathed in a touching romantic glow. There's a lot to be said for exploring the nuances of clichés in songwriting, and most of it has been said. Listening to Lekman makes me sharply aware of how the generic and the cryptic have come to dominate pop lyrics, from Lady Gaga on down to Girls. The modern lingua franca is an abstract slipstream of memories, slogans, admonitions, and impressions, as if emotional states were free-floating entities, unmoored from specific experiences. This mode is ideal for self-projection and introspection, both valuable quantities. But Lekman's music makes me think more about other people than myself. For all of their polished mannerisms, his songs are uncommonly free of pretenses-- they're about people, places, and things that happened or could happen in the world; about how we spend our time and how we talk to each other. Against a backdrop of enigmatic universalism, musicians who undertake the ticklish business of pinning down the minutiae of human affairs are very dear. Alongside Dan Bejar and Bill Callahan, Jens Lekman stands tall among them.","The Swedish indie-pop dramatist's new EP is a compact gem, one that shows different facets of the singer. Each song does something distinct both sonically and lyrically, filtering one rarified but relatable sensibility through guise after revealing guise.

Again Into Eyes,S.C.U.M.,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10f5e6ef95969322084/1:1/w_160/1b281b61.jpg,2011-09-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15828-scum-again-into-eyes/,Mute,"Look up any review of S.C.U.M. in the British music press, and you're likely to encounter the phrase ""little Horrors,"" a diminutive comparison to the band that put out this year's fine LP Skying. This was S.C.U.M.'s first handy hook for the NME-- not only because bassist Huw Webb is the younger brother of the Horrors' Rhys Webb, but also because the bands share traits on the musical and magazine-ready haircuts-and-cheekbones levels. This seems like the sort of tag the younger quintet would be eager to shake off, the better to stand on their own feet, but it's a lineage S.C.U.M. can't entirely lose on debut album Again Into Eyes. In the two years since their formation, S.C.U.M. have followed a strikingly similar path to that of their elders: Both began as brash, noisy outfits-- the Horrors as goth garage shriekers, S.C.U.M. with a reputation for no-wave noise-making live shows-- and have arrived in 2011 at an atmosphere-heavy, 1980s-influenced rock sound that's less abrasive and vastly more ambitious than those origins might've predicted. That tends to mean impeccably produced moody, mid-tempo rock songs, swaddled in vaporous synth textures, and led by seductively fainting singing. In S.C.U.M., the singing's done by Thomas Cohen, whose breathy, soft moaning smears across the rhythms on ""Summon the Sound"", drifting over the edge of the beat as it fades into the distance. It's a familiar effect, but Cohen's singing sounds less affected and more skillful than that of the Horrors' Faris Badwan. Another important distinction: While the Horrors recently rounded off the edges of their guitar tones (to the point of largely obscuring the instrument's original sound), S.C.U.M. have done away with guitars almost entirely in favor of keyboards and synthesizers. (A less commonly mentioned but perhaps more interesting family tie is that S.C.U.M. keyboardist Samuel Kilcoyne is the son of Add N to (X)'s Barry Smith-- one imagines him inheriting a pile of pristine-condition Moog synthesizers for his 16th birthday.) One six-string features on single ""Amber Hands"", and there may be some more deep in the mix elsewhere (band member Bradley Baker is credited with ""machines, press,"" which leaves room for some ambiguity). Either way, the band relies less on sharp, mix-piercing leads than on amorphous washes from which the melodies gently emerge-- it's an accomplished sound, one that may not immediately dispense with the comparisons that have dogged the band, but one that does suggest a group more than capable of outgrowing the associations.","The so-called ""little Horrors"" feature Horrors' Rhys Webb's little brother on bass and share similarites with their elders on the musical and haircuts-and-cheekbones levels, but their debut suggests the Valerie Solanas-referencing post-punk group is capable of outgrowing some of these associations.

Zig Zaj,Boom Bip,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10d9d034d5c69bf497b/1:1/w_160/02df162d.jpg,2011-09-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15829-zig-zaj/,Lex,"It's easy to picture Bryan Hollon casting a few interested glances at Ford & Lopatin earlier this year, particularly when the duo gained acclaim for embellishing their work with overt 1980s pop references on Channel Pressure. Hollon, better known by the Boom Bip moniker he's recorded under for more than a decade, had already covered vastly territory in 2008 through his Neon Neon project with Super Furry Animals singer Gruff Rhys. But his work there and as Boom Bip has been characterized by a restless desire to keep his sound in flux, to constantly seek out fresh collaborators and remixers, to help pull away from any set patterns he may be settling into. Even Neon Neon, which bustled with future potential, quickly went quiet after Stainless Style was released. Hollon's work as Boom Bip has also fallen into protracted periods of silence-- this is the first full-length release under that name since the 2005 album Blue Eyed in the Red Room. The fastidious arrangements that proliferate throughout Zig Zaj suggest he's spent much of that time laboring over these tunes, getting everything just right and slotting new collaborators into the fold. Hollon is primarily a producer of instrumental electronic works that grab from a range of disparate influences in that field. But he's also well known for the collaborators he brings into the fold. Rhys and Nina Nastasia featured on Blue Eyed; Alex Kapranos, Money Mark, and Josh Klinghoffer from the Red Hot Chili Peppers all worked on Zig Zaj. This one lacks a cohesive narrative in the same way that last Boom Bip full-length release did-- that's to be expected from an album with such a diverse crew on board. It's a world that takes some adjusting to, especially when you get a great lurch from the Grizzly Bear-like, chain-gang grind of ""All Hands"" to the broody noir-esque pop moves of the Kapranos-fronted ""Goodbye Lovers and Friends"". In fact, casual listeners could be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled onto an outright indie rock record at certain points, especially after a cursory listen to the verse-chorus-verse structure (complete with grinding guitars) of the latter song. On ""New Order"" Klinghoffer and Empire of the Sun vocalist Luke Steele garishly clash to push the Boom Bip sound closer to the kind of pop-metal-techno hybrid the Prodigy were practicing in their heyday. ""New Order"" is particularly jarring here and is likely to be a divisive and confounding track for Hollon's fans. It's a shame he found the need to bludgeon us so hard, as his real forte comes from gradually layering on elements, either in subtle, slow-build movements (""Reveal"") or through steely, Ladytron-esque grooves (""Automation""). It would be wrong to complain that Hollon doesn't know what he wants Boom Bip to be, as he's always operated in this manner. But Zig Zaj feels like he's straining a little too hard to make every song different from the last, where he’s actually become pinned down by the ""eclectic"" reputation he's accrued, forcing him to make unwise decisions just to keep a certain degree of diversity afloat in his work. Fortunately, there aren't too many other clangers in the vein of ""New Order"". The Boom Bip sound really flourishes when Hollon happens upon a suitable meshing of his dual interests in indie rock and electronica-- on Zig Zaj that point occurs on the wonderful ""Pele"", which bears a heavy load of austere electronics that are gradually flipped out of the picture by some distinctly Cure-like flanged guitar riffing. It's got that refined power of suggestion the higher quality Boom Bip tracks possess, which makes it doubly mystifying that he's occasionally happy to swap all that out and resort to sheer brute strength. But the individual songs on this record will find more color when extracted from the constraints of the album. It's not hard to see ""Goodbye Lovers and Friends"" getting a decent lease of life as a pop single, whereas here it feels like a malformed part of the puzzle that won't quite slot into place. No doubt Hollon wouldn't have it any other way.","Bryan Hollon's first Boom Bip full-length since 2005 features Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos, Money Mark, Empire of the Sun's Luke Steele, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Josh Klinghoffer, and some unwise decisions.

Red EP,Weekend,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11713d197565213a591/1:1/w_160/c90defa6.jpeg,2011-09-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15843-red-ep/,Slumberland,"Maybe the best thing about Sports, last year's bruising debut from San Francisco noise-poppers Weekend, was simply how refreshing it sounded. While so many other lo-fi acts were still messing around with balmy haze and Nuggets jangle, these guys took the sound down darker, more aggressive paths. The album's marriage of squall and melody wasn't really anything new, but just by channeling a different set of influences-- post-punk, shoegaze, the Jesus and Mary Chain-- Weekend's music felt so much more visceral than their peers'. At the same time, Sports' charm boiled down to one idea executed very well, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to worry if they had the depth to do that again. So it's encouraging to hear Weekend making significant alterations to their formula on the Red EP. Offered as a teaser for an as-yet-untitled, upcoming LP, Red finds the band operating in a much cleaner, dreamier mode and mostly pulling it off. In addition to cutting back on the background screech that dominated Sports and drawing out more melody, the big difference is how the band treats frontman Shaun Durkan's voice. Previously a croaky drone used as an accent, Durkan's vox is richer, recorded higher in the mix, and able to carry a song on its own. The best place to hear Weekend's more direct approach is on standout ""Hazel"", a killer shoegaze-pop number that has a lot in common with swirling 1990s classics like Catherine Wheel's ""Black Metallic"". Set over an insistent, post-punk drumbeat and throbbing bass, the track becomes nicely un-tethered, letting guitars spin in and out of focus. There's great dark/light tension between its tight construction and looser elements, and Durkan's vocal strings it all together with a warm pop hook. The band hits similar high notes on ""Sweet Sixteen"" and ""The One You Want"". The cool thing about these songs is that while they aren't as threatening as some of the Sports stuff, they're no less dark-- it's just a more pensive and mysterious kind of noir. Red is only five tracks long, and two of the cuts-- ""Your Own Nothing"" and the weirdly titled ""Golfers""-- are a little slight, so there's only so much you can take away from it. But it's an important release for Weekend, one of those classic transitional EPs-- Deerhunter's Rainwater Cassette Exchange and Abe Vigoda's Reviver spring to mind as recent examples-- where a band takes stock of its strengths and starts to pivot in a new direction. Maybe even more important is that it shows this band as much more agile and nuanced than some previously thought, able to make noise one part of its attack instead of the primary focus.","Offered as a teaser for the dark San Francisco noise-pop trio's as-yet-untitled, upcoming sophomore album, this five-song EP finds the band operating in a cleaner, dreamier mode.

Mikal Cronin,Mikal Cronin,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11513d197565213a58a/1:1/w_160/9deb118f.jpg,2011-09-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15844-mikal-cronin/,Trouble in Mind,"Just out of college, Mikal Cronin already has a proven record at garage-rock bashing. As bassist and singer for the Moonhearts (formerly Charle & the Moonhearts), he spent his dorm-dwelling years releasing a sporadic string of fuzz-infused surf-rock tunes. More notably, he's the Waylon Jennings to Ty Segall's Buddy Holly-- a collaborator and sideman who sometimes fills the bass chair in the psych-rock upstart's live band. Friends since high school, they've released a split LP, Reverse Shark Attack, and a handful of singles. But it's Segall-- among the most prolific voices in the thoroughly prolific San Francisco garage scene-- who tends to get the top billing. On his eponymous debut, Mikal Cronin proves he can hold his own. It's an album of wistful, psychedelic pop that pits lush and layered arrangements against needle-pinning power chords. Like Segall's latest, Goodbye Bread, Cronin's solo turn finds him dialing back his thrashier impulses in order to clear space for singer-songwriter-style introspection. But when the curtain of lysergic gristle is pulled aside, it turns out that they're not the same person, after all. Even when he goes all Neil Young, Segall still retains an affable beach-dude demeanor. Cronin turns out to be the more vulnerable voice-- Elliott Smith in throwback dress, minus the self-loathing. And, like Smith, he has an ear for arrangements. Album opener ""Is It Alright"" pivots from Beach Boys-worthy harmonies to chugging chords to jangling acoustic guitars before, finally, spinning off into an outro that sounds like Jethro Tull gone hardcore punk. It's no so much that Cronin knows how to effectively layer instruments (though he does) or collage disparate ideas together (though he does), but that he knows how to use dynamics to his advantage. On ""Gone"" he works soft-to-loud changes, dropping the bridge down to a whisper before bounding back up for a final, climactic freak-out. At the end of ""Again and Again"", Cronin drops out the rhythm section, rebuilding the song over a gentle falsetto melody. Cronin's music owes a heavy debt to 1960s pop, mostly T. Rex and the Beatles (the sax outro on ""Apathy"" is weirdly reminiscent of the Beatles ""Hey Jude""), but his tunes aren't precious period reconstructions. They're delivered with the gritty, gnarly abandon of a Black Flag fan trying to come to terms with their parents' record collection. Like Segall, Cronin brings a young energy to classic rock sounds because, well, he's actually young. In interviews, Cronin has explained that the bulk of the album was written during the twilight months of his college career, when he was lonely and stressed and taking refuge in his tape recorder. Not exactly as trying a set of circumstances as, say, Tupac recording ""Me Against the World"", but a sensitive time, for sure. It's a transition that marks the end of structured life and the onset of a long-postponed adulthood, when you're too young and too old at the same time. Cronin nails that mood perfectly, with songs that are frustrated and energetic but flagged with uncertainty and doubt. The songs kick hardest when those melancholy sentiments collide with his crunching, chugging psychedelic urges-- when the volume is blasting in both the amps and the emotions.","On his solo debut, the California garage-rock multi-instrumentalist and Ty Segall collaborator concocts a collection of wistful, psychedelic pop that pits lush and layered arrangements against needle-pinning power chords.

Fabriclive 59,Four Tet,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ff5e6ef9596932206a/1:1/w_160/960a0811.jpeg,2011-09-21 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15830-fabriclive-59/,Fabric,"Kieran Hebden has always been singled out for his adventurous tastes and the way his disparate obsessions have been seamlessly melded into his own stylistically restless music. Hebden listened without prejudice, a value prized by both the post-rock and DJ communities he came out of at the tail end of the 1990s. Even as eclecticism took a beating in the early 2000s, with mash-up acts and bedroom DJs turning the whole idea into a one-note joke or a cheap way to get noticed, Hebden never shied away from mixing it all up, provided the whole felt greater than the trick of joining seemingly incompatible parts. Fabric has made a point of flagging Hebden's new mix for its sonic and conceptual unity. Certainly it does feel all of a piece compared to his last commercially released mix, a 2006 installment for the DJ-Kicks series that swerved from Akufen to Animal Collective. By contrast, Fabriclive 59 sticks pretty consistently to one scene. But it's a restless scene built on a premise of constant reinvention: UK garage, which from the late 1990s to the early 2000s mutated from a simultaneously roughed-up and opulent take on house music to the fierce and rap-derived clang-and-bang of grime. So already we've got the promise and surprise inherent in a famously eclectic selector bringing a freshness and fearlessness to music usually only spun by purist DJs sticking to music from within the scene. On that level, Hebden doesn't disappoint. For one thing, he includes ringers from way outside late-90s London, like Ricardo Villalobos. And despite their modern, weirdo-techno palette of sounds, these left-field inclusions fit perfectly with the vibe of the old-school tunes, especially the way someone like Villalobos treats his own heavily syncopated drums. As usual, it's to Hebden's credit as a DJ that he hears ways to join old and new that others might not. But this is also a pretty unexpected and exciting way to tackle a big-time commission from Fabric, especially considering the Fabriclive series tends to focus on up-to-the-minute dance sounds rather than the archival impulse. UK garage as an inventive and real-time underground phenomenon already seems a distant part of dance history, despite being only about a decade gone. So for longtime garage heads, Hebden's obsessive crate-digging will provide them with lots of unfamiliar and almost lost-to-history moments of genius. I've spent more time tracking this stuff down than I care to admit, and I recognize only a couple of the vintage tunes here. But Fabriclive 59 will also expose Four Tet fans who come from entirely different worlds (indie, IDM) to some truly luscious and forward-thinking dance music that's otherwise available only on out-of-print vinyl singles and even-more-out-of-print CD comps. Despite his rep as a boundary-crosser not beholden to any one scene, Hebden has deep roots here as an engaged fan. The B-side to one of his first Four Tet singles, ""Calamine"", was an avant take on UK garage when almost no one in the rock or electronic worlds seemed to be paying attention. It's easy to see what appealed to him. UKG fulfilled dance music's no. 1 rule (keep it funky) while also sticking to a less-often-followed guideline (make that funk feel new again). Few producers at the time were doing as much to reinvent the art of beatmaking without trying for something expressly ""experimental"" and alienating clubbers along the way. So if you're a fan of those moments in rap or dance when baffling syncopations become an art in themselves, when drum patterns feel like they couldn't possibly be played by a human with just two arms, you'll find a lot to love here. And if you like your mixes to have the smooth bump and ingratiating warmness of house, amazingly, this music also fits the bill. After all, the earliest UK garage cuts, like Persian's ""Feel da Vibe"", weren't so far from house's more steady sense of groove. It just had a lot more swing. Making broken-sounding rhythms swing was actually the primary goal of the best garage DJs, and Hebden proves himself very attuned to making all these not always mix-friendly rhythms flow together. So much so that, when he drops Musical Mob's ""Pulse X""-- the stomping and snarling and totally blunt track that announced grime as a new thing-- it seems to fit naturally with all these super-subtle syncopations. But true to Hebden's status-- insider fan trying to rekindle the UKG vibe and outsider after-the-fact archivist not beholden to the scene's rules-- Fabriclive 59 doesn't really play out like a true vintage garage mix would have. For one thing, our DJ has some formalist fun with the disc's structure. After building a stretch of groove, he lets things simmer down, bridging the sections with sampled crowd noise from the Fabric club itself, less breaking the mix's momentum than allowing a breather before things bubble back to life. The effect is like catching a pirate radio DJ in the mix, only to dial across the airwaves and find another just-as-good set on a different station. Keeping listeners on their toes while also mimicking the way this music was often heard by fans-- it's an odd but effective approach, especially considering the usual keep-the-party-going Fabriclive style. Fabriclive 59 feels more like a mixtape in the handcrafted sense, one friend making another a tape of special moments they may have missed. But of course few of us have a friend with the mixing skills or deep record collection of Kieran Hebden.","Kieran Hebden's conceptually tight Fabriclive 59 mix is built upon the restless UK garage scene, which from the late 1990s to the early 2000s mutated from a simultaneously roughed-up and opulent take on house music to the fierce and rap-derived clang-and-bang of grime.

Five years and two indecisive EPs later, Tammar make structured and sturdy rock music driven by what still feels like an on-the-fly soul. On Visits, the band's confident debut studio LP, swollen drones and surprising subtleties temper the epic impulses on tunes that, in less artful hands, might be overly grandiose anthems gone wrong. Appropriate for a group that began with free-music explorations, Tammar intuit when to build, when to change, and when to collapse. Never obvious or predictable, the band crafts songs that aren't boring, but also aren't too big. Like Spacemen 3 with Wembley Stadium aspirations. Indeed, most every tune on Visits leaves its indelible mark, bursts of melody that linger long after the song itself has expired. But six of these seven tracks break the five-minute mark, meaning that Tammar depend on much more than hooks for the 44 minutes. ""Deep Witness"" creaks open with a keyboard hum, eventually abetted by the sound of a glowing guitar amplifier and a snare slap that seems set for infinity. Walter delivers a barely decipherable refrain-- something about not being able to slow down and maybe a bit about kissing, too-- three times, and it sticks. The focus, though, is the atmosphere, or the way those iterations of the slogan refract into these fierce instrumental movements. Tammar even have the thankful audacity to open Visits with ""Heavy Tonight"", their least immediate and maybe most involved tune. The drums twist in circles while an organ growls, both doing their best to push Walter's vocals into the background. The song feels like a massive sonic blur, as if Neu! were handed the master tapes of a 1970s album rock trove and a commission to remix at will. ""Summer Fun"" is the shortest tune here by a minute and the most radio-ready by a mile. Still, it depends more on its shifting components-- an irascible bassline that won't sit still, hand claps that demand space alongside the snapping drums, and guitars that spiral like the dB's before surging like Slint-- than its hook. Tammar take full advantage of this proper debut platform, trading the low-key, mid-fidelity aspect of their EPs for sessions that reinforce their ideas with volume and power. Mike Bridavsky captures the breadth of the band's palette, while the excellent mixing of former Zero Boy Paul Mahern puts each simple layer in full, perfect focus. You can hear the ingenuity and purpose in the drone that fades at the end of ""The Last Line"" and phoenixes at the start of ""Deep Witness"". (This move smartly echoes the War on Drugs, a band signed to Tammar keyboardist Ben Swanson's label Secretly Canadian.) You can feel the colossal rhythmic shifts within the humming-to-howling ""Yung Jun"". Closer ""Frost Meter"" begins as a delicate web of twinkling guitar, repeating loops, drifting vocals, and teasing percussion. By the time it reaches the four-minute mark, it's a throttling tune with a Motorik insistence and a Johnny Lydon sneer. Tammar lose nothing between those poles because they carefully develop and deliver each layer-- a five-piece with five members writing their own interesting parts but coming together for a common good. In short, these are good songs given license to be something much bigger and more consuming.","After five years and two EPs, this onetime-improvisational outfit's debut LP features structured and sturdy rock music driven by an on-the-fly soul.

American Goldwing,Blitzen Trapper,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10913d197565213a577/1:1/w_160/3aedd842.jpg,2011-09-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15825-american-goldwing/,Sub Pop,"Blitzen Trapper's sixth album is named for a touring motorcycle meant for long hauls down endless highways, not short joy rides or joyless commutes. The Portland band means to create music that evokes the wind blowing your hair back, the miles falling away behind you, and quite possibly bugs getting stuck in your teeth. Frontman Eric Earley has explained that the album was inspired by the ""inescapable past"" and the eternal call of the open road-- the latter a specifically American idea that is almost necessarily soundtracked with American music. To their considerable credit, Blitzen Trapper eschew the spray-on grit of contemporaries like Dawes, Deer Tick, or Dr. Dog. Instead, they embrace a broad definition of Americana that covers the Dead, Kiss, and Pavement. In the past they've shown little hesitation mixing and matching rambling, country-rock melodies against heavy-rock riffs and slack-rock rhythms, creating an anything-goes sound that seemed obstinately determined not to close off any musical avenue, but to roll down every street. Their early albums, up to and including Wild Mountain Nation, sounded both lively and studious, fresh and familiar. After signing with Sub Pop, however, Blitzen Trapper have been whittling all of those possibilities down to a not-so-sharp point. Goldwing rides the same familiar roads we've been down so many times before, yet even a decade into their career, Blitzen Trapper sound less like denizens of the road than tourists snapping pictures of rock-historical monuments. After a brief but promising burst of squealing distortion, ""Fletcher"" settles into a genial ramble, sketching out a hitchhiking character ""drinking whiskey from a jar through his teeth"" and randomly shooting pistols for fun. These are concrete details, but never pertain to anyone found on the actual road. Instead, the title character comes across as an over-romanticized archetype, a stand-in for the band's infatuation with the America of classic rock rather than the America of 2011. That impression is only reinforced by the ramshackle sound, which is cribbed almost wholesale from the Band-- not from their Big Pink days, but from their less fruitful California period. In other words, we've been down this road before, with Blitzen Trapper and with so many acts before them. There's no adventure here, no real wanderlust. Even when they try to change things up, it never comes across especially well. The hoedown that opens ""Your Crying Eyes"" segues abruptly into an ascending riff not too dissimilar to Big Star's ""In the Street"". While it's a relief that Trapper don't follow that coda through to its logical nu-old-time conclusion, the transition sounds jarring and overthought. Still, songs like ""Your Crying Eyes"" and ""Street Fighting Sun"", with their muscle-car guitars and passing-lane momentum, at least rev up American Goldwing a bit. The album stalls during midtempo numbers ""My Home Town"" and ""Girl in a Coat"", which showcase Earley's hangdog vocals and roadside imagery. Ultimately, the trip they're taking us on isn't into America, but into the past, and they show too much reverence for their forebears.","The Portland band's sixth album is named for a touring motorcycle meant for long hauls down endless highways, but a decade into their career, Blitzen Trapper sound less like denizens of the road and more like tourists snapping pictures of rock-historical monuments.

The Devil's Walk,Apparat,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10b9d034d5c69bf4977/1:1/w_160/bc35d120.jpg,2011-09-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15836-the-devils-walk/,Mute,"Apparat's Sascha Ring has kept busy the last few years with various mixes and side projects-- an entry into the DJ-Kicks series, his Moderat collaboration with fellow Berliners Modeselektor-- but hasn't released a proper solo album since 2007's Walls. That record, which brought together electro-shoegaze sweep with a vocal-driven pop approach, felt like a breakthrough for him. In place of the dance-floor glitch of his early-2000s work were songs with hooks, and his sense of lush atmosphere gave them a certain weight and grandiosity. Writers mentioned 1990s dream-poppers Slowdive, and that seemed like an apt comparison for the velvety digital fusion he was exploring. Of course, a lot's changed in four years, and Ring's latest LP, The Devil's Walk, arrives at a time when vocal electronic music is more popular than ever. Though his style differs quite a bit from guys like James Blake or the chillwave set, there's nonetheless a bigger audience for pop set to programmed beats. And anyone checking in for the first time should find plenty to like here, right off the bat. Particularly in the record's front half, Ring shows off formidable production skill, wrapping his whispery vocals in some straight-up gorgeous arrangements. Synths swell up and retreat, drums skitter in and out frame-- there's a lot of motion but it's got grace and purpose. But this isn't an instrumental record, and in order for it to succeed on multiple levels, the lyrics and songwriting should be on point, too. That happens some of the time-- ""Song of Los"" and ""Black Water"" showcase Ring at his most emotive, his melancholic vocals and phrases yearning and nearly anthemic. But several of these tracks have a vaguely cheesy, power-ballad quality about them. It's a hard thing to put your finger on, but much of The Devil's Walk seems like it was intended to be ""epic""-- there are plenty of whisper-to-a-roar builds, at least on the vocal side-- and this pursuit of bigness gets tangled up in overly sentimental, conventional radio-pop delivery. For example, if you were to remove the sparkling backdrop from ""Escape"", you'd be left with something that resembles a B-level Coldplay song, complete with some eyebrow-raising imagery of ""the street rushing beneath"" and ""cracks in the concrete."" Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of awestruck emoting; it just feels like a weird fit with Apparat's sonic approach, this very thoughtful and intricate techno. The styles work against each other. So, in the end, the record is a disjointed listen-- there are some really beautiful and even moving stretches but too many missed opportunities to truly bring together Ring's love of pop with his natural gift for beats.","The thoughtful German electronic musician's first album in four years arrives at a time when vocal electronic music is more popular than ever, but his melancholic, yearning phrasing occasionally pushes things closer to Coldplay than to James Blake.

Pop Music / False B-Sides,Baths,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b112b1335d7bf169a201/1:1/w_160/4db025bf.jpeg,2011-09-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15837-pop-music-false-b-sides/,Anticon,"When Will Wiesenfeld recorded a Daytrotter session under his Baths moniker earlier this year, he chose to include three piano ballads in his four-song set. There's a certain logic at work there, considering the emotionally charged material on his debut full-length, Cerulean, from last year, but it's still not a move that most beat-obsessed bedroom producers would have the balls to try out. Wiesenfeld's post-Cerulean career has partially been shaped by a series of left turns, whether it's through his desire to work in piano balladry and on his more passive Geotic project, or in his affable banter with audiences during his live shows. During the Pitchfork Music Festival in July, he seemed to spend most of his non-stage time wandering among the crowds with his shirt off. Wiesenfeld clearly doesn't care to be bracketed, either personally or professionally, and Pop Music / False B-Sides is his latest attempt to crush all those competing sides of his personality into song. What's most impressive about Baths is how that all-embracing approach never devolves into sloppiness or identity loss. Wiesenfeld is always careful to string recognizable, Baths-like traits through his sound so that the listener never comes completely unshackled from his world. Sometimes it's through those stringy beats that he's so adept at constructing (""Seaside Town""); at others it's when he drenches a song in bathos via a few twists of his immaculate falsetto (""Iniuria Palace""). Frequently both of those elements are deployed, such as on the standout ""Pop Song"". This isn't supposed to be a proper follow-up to Cerulean-- it's a collection of tracks Wiesenfeld has worked on since that album was released, originally made available to fans who attended a tour from earlier this year-- which illustrates the strength in depth he has at his fingertips when something as appealingly frail as ""Pop Song"" is buried here. If this is an indication of where Wiesenfeld is heading, it feels like a spot somewhere between Geotic and Baths, with a greater emphasis on traditional instrumentation. Strangely, it's often reminiscent of work by artists who have walked backwards into the electronic world and assimilated some of its elements after wringing all the inspiration out of the guitar-bass-drums format. ""Somerset"", for instance, skews close to the kind of dolorous studio experimentation Blur were tooling around with on 13, all tied to a looping, post-rock bassline that could have been uprooted from Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die. That material points to Baths' future, although there are still a few ties to the Cerulean comfort zone (on the jumpy ""Seaside Town"" and the fuzzed-out ""Damnation"") that make Pop Music / False B-Sides feel like a passing of the baton from old to new. That could be how this album is viewed in the Baths' discography in future years, depending on where Wiesenfeld heads next, which is another testament to his sequencing skills. There are no huge stylistic leaps here, just a subtle testing ground laid out so new ideas can be unwrapped and worked into the sound. It's clear that Wiesenfeld has progressed as a lyricist too, with tracks like ""Nordic Laurel"" and ""Iniuria Palace"" easily among the best song-oriented works he's produced. There are occasional misfires, particularly when Wiesenfeld channels his inner Robert Smith on ""Tatami"", but in the context of this release he can be cut a little more slack than if this were Baths' actual second album. For most of this record, he's still wrapped up in those sci-fi lullabies that made his name, while also gently prodding his surprisingly malleable aesthetic into welcome new territories.","This collection of post-Cerulean material-- previously available only as a limited tour CD-- is Will Wiesenfeld's latest attempt to crush the competing sides of his personality into song.

The 5 EPs,Disco Inferno,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e3b1335d7bf169a1ba/1:1/w_160/70a68992.jpg,2011-09-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15814-the-5-eps/,One Little Indian,"People talk a lot about how it's easier to be an ""experimental"" band in the 21st-century. Like most rhetoric about the way the web changed music, that's not quite so true for everyone all the time. But the story of British avant-rock band Disco Inferno certainly proves how hard it could be to try something new in the days before the internet allowed you to get your music out to a worldwide audience without the cost, financial and otherwise, of widespread touring, album production, and distribution-- all that supposedly 20th-century baggage. Between roughly 1991 and 1996, Disco Inferno wrote two albums and five EPs that comprised some of the most forward-thinking rock of an era when rock bands were constantly trying to one-up each other in pushing the music into the future. Yet it wasn't until the 21st century that DI finally found the devoted audience they deserved. In a very real way, we can thank message-board word-of-mouth, blog bootlegging, and the work of a few evangelical fans for The Five EPs, a long-rumored legal collection of the cream of DI's output. It seems hard to argue now, given how widely loved they are, that DI's music is too out-there, too much to process, too difficult to reach a large listenership. Perhaps the grind-- press indifference, label mismanagement, trying to build a fanbase one low-paying and sparsely attended gig at a time-- proved to be too much. Whatever the reason for DI's dissolving, their 21st-century rescue from obscurity is cause for celebration, and so is The Five EPs, a record that should be heard by anyone with an interest in those rare times when rock attempts brashly to chart new sonic territory. So what was so experimental, so forward-thinking about DI? Well, they were a rock band who used digital samplers, inspired by the hip-hop and rave wizards making jigsaw-puzzle pop with Akais and bottom-shelf PCs at the turn of the 90s. ""Rock plus samples"" might have been a novel hook at the time, but not quite unheard of. (Certain industrial acts beat DI to the punch there, for one thing.) And it probably seems so common as to be unremarkable now, when almost every band packs a laptop when going on tour. What made DI so exciting is what they did with those samplers, which sounds as singular now as it did then. Singular, but not wholly alien. True, The Five EPs can occasionally get pretty abstract. Easily the album's most difficult but oddly inspired nine minutes, ""From the Devil to the Deep Blue Sea"" takes samples of breaking glass and fashions them into something halfway between a Steve Reich-like percussion piece and someone ""improvising"" with a window and a hammer. But for the most part, these 15 tracks aren't ""soundscapes."" DI were still very much a songwriter's band, even after switching allegiance from power chords to 1s and 0s. The rhythm section of Rob Whatley and Paul Wilmott, the band's perpetually underrated foundational element, could still lay down a driving groove learned from years of listening to Joy Division records. Frontman Ian Crause could unfurl sparkling melodies, gleaned from masters like Vini Reilly, that actually seemed to issue from a guitar you could pick up at your local music shop. And Crause's lyrics (more about these in a bit) were among the most impassioned but clear-eyed of the 90s. But after accelerating their standard-issue, garage-band gear with the latest in musical tech, DI replaced riffs with children's jumprope chants or old-time radio show chatter or trilling birdsong, and drums with fireworks popping in mid-air or splashing water or the crunch of hard-packed snow. Sometimes DI's use of samples feels like thrilling punctuation to what might otherwise be sparkling indie pop or moody post-punk songs, using natural sounds or the noise of urban life the way other bands might throw in a James Brown drum fill or a quote from an old movie. But more often they stripped away everything but a suggestive bass pulse or ripple of guitar. Then they built whole tracks, layer by layer, from those sampled sounds, textures, and noises that seemed like they couldn't be coming from a guitar, bass, or drums. Yet they were. That tension between tradition and future shock means there are moments here that may remind you of something you've heard before. But there are many, many more when you'll wonder why more bands didn't follow DI's lead and make ""guitar"" music that could actually, truly sound like gale-force winds, or a multi-car crash, or a trip to the dark side of the moon. At their best, DI rendered a familiar template-- the kind of rock songs once released by Factory Records or Rough Trade-- once again unpredictable and vital. It's probably no accident that they drew the attention of Rough Trade itself toward the end of their career, as torchbearers for the label's visionary spirit. They didn't trash the idea of rock songs in favor of the new genres blooming all around them at the time. They kept rock songs alive by proving you could still write them even after you stripped away just about every familiar element. That rebuilt-from-unfamiliar-bits approach had the potential to leave accessibility far behind, but DI's music could also have a playfulness about the possibility of alienating people. ""D.I. Go Pop"", from the third of the EPs, plays like a tape of a three-chord punk pisstake that's being sped up and slowed down by a band that's sick to death of punk rock, until the whole track becomes a see-sawing smear of digital distortion. Unlike the 1994 album of the same name, which is undeniably DI's most willfully chaotic and deeply sad record, ""D.I. Goes Pop"" has some of the same cheek of the Beta Band, who crafted a much smoother rock-meets-DJ-cut-up aesthetic a few years later, with the same pull between making you laugh and tweaking your nose. They also had a knack for couching discomforting sentiments in even their most boisterous and agreeable tunes. ""It's a Kid's World"", which infamously swipes the drums from Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"", imagines what the Children's Television Workshop or the producers of Pee-wee's Playhouse might have done with the materials of glam rock. That booming big beat gets swarmed by ray-gun noises and slidewhistle silliness until it builds a whimsical wall of noise, like a kiddie MBV. Yet it opens with some of the most withering lines in Crause's none-too-sunny catalog: ""Mediocrity surrounds you/ People pressing down around you/ There's nowhere else to go but down and out."" Things don't get much lighter from there on out, and I don't just mean in this particular ditty. It's almost too easy to discuss DI as if they were some sort of left-field DJ project. Everyone focuses on the mind-boggling musical invention, and they're not necessarily wrong to do so. But one of the most exciting things about DI's music is the way all-too-human feeling is woven into the futuristic collage through Crause's lyrics. Crause again and again takes a long, hard, unblinking look at his country, his time, but most of all himself, and alternating currents of disillusionment and hope, uncertainty, and possibility run through The Five EPs. The Five EPs describes a world where an oasis of happiness is a rare thing, the best lack all conviction, experimental indie bands are thwarted by indifferent landlords, the free market's left the working poor up shit creek, people who hope to change things have no idea where to start, and immigrants get beaten on the streets while everyone else politely averts their eyes. ""Summer's Last Sound"" takes the comforting vocabulary of new-age music-- rushing water, birdsong-- and darkens it with mentions of ""mass graves"" and ""broken windows"" and ""foreigners [getting] hushed-up trials,"" all while the bulk of Englanders go on about their late-summer fun, oblivious. It's as beautiful and immersive as anything to come out of shoegaze or the ambient house that was being made at the same time, but it also suggests that chilling out is a luxury for those who are lucky enough to be able to avoid the headlines. I don't want to give the impression that this is a wholly bleak record, though a lot of it can be emotionally hard-going. It's not as if a pervasive unease and sorrow hangs over The Five EPs. There are moments of guarded-if-not-great joy, too. If DI's sound suggests three men endlessly thrilled by the way digital technology could extend and reshape rock, emotionally as much as sonically, then that sense of possibility has to leak into the lyrics and the mood occasionally. ""There's so much pessimism in the world it's frightening,"" Crause sing-songs on ""The Atheist's Burden"", one of several songs that suggests the past is a country suffocated by mistakes but the future might still have a place for realists, if not cynics. If the band was wholly without hope, why would they have bothered to push themselves so hard on these records? If disillusionment finally won out, the band is ultimately entitled to its personal reasons for packing it in. Because at least they gave us the records, and The Five EPs, along with DI's last two albums, remain as light and dense, as dizzying and inspiring, as when they were recorded. And hopefully now they'll be heard by many more than they were at the time.","In the early and mid 1990s, the British trio Disco Inferno wrote two albums and five EPs that comprised some of the most forward-thinking rock of the era. The Five EPs is a record that should be heard by anyone with an interest in those rare times when rock attempts brashly to chart new sonic territory.

Soita Mulle,Regina,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b103ea9e61561daa66f1/1:1/w_160/87b01018.jpg,2011-09-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15833-souta-mulle/,Friendly Fire,"That thing about a picture being worth a thousand words? Someone should remind Regina. The front cover of the Finnish indie pop band's fourth proper album, Soita Mulle (Finnish for ""Call me""), is adorned with a beautiful black-and-white photo (taken by Megan Kathleen McIsaac) of two people lying down in a pastoral setting. Unfortunately, the ugly and carelessly placed typeface obscures and, in effect, blunts the image's aesthetic beauty. Obviously, the band has a need to claim ownership for the album's contents, but the image on its own so excellently represents Soita Mulle's sensual, arresting feel that it functions strongly as a statement of purpose. Largely, Regina are working within what many listeners will instantly recognize as the dreamy, limitless confines of shoegaze-- only, their take on it is less staticky and obscured than the way today's younger bands have approached the genre. Soita Mulle's most impressionistic moments sound clean and deep-- an approach similar to what stateside shoegazers School of Seven Bells did on last year's Disconnect From Desire-- providing space to wrap yourself within their compositions, rather than attempt to smother you with blistering, fuzzy noise. This sound fits Regina like a glove, and the new look largely makes Soita Mulle their best record yet-- admittedly, an easy feat. Since 2005's Katso Maisemaa, the band's toyed with various genres and sounds just close enough to occasionally mix and mingle-- the cool allure of French yé-yé, snatches of downtempo dance music, Stereolab's bouncy warmth. 2009's U.S. debut, Puutarhatrilogia, marked their most consistent effort at that point, but Iisa Pykäri's thin, power-bereft voice resulted in her surroundings sounding occasionally chintzy and under-produced. On Soita Mulle, multi-instrumentalist/principal songwriter Mikko Pykäri's production hand is heavy on the lushness, resulting in something more full-bodied and robust in sound. And, the improvements that Iisa's made as a vocalist are not to be overlooked: the album's highlights find her dipping in and out of melodies, filling the air with her voice, and effortlessly unleashing torrents of Finnish syllables. When she lets out a sweet melodic sigh near the end of ""Haluan Sinut"", you breathe with her, and that's a good thing. Of course, Regina being Regina, the band still does a bit of outside-the-lines genre exploration, and as on previous efforts, it doesn't always come out well. On one hand, the piping synths of ""Ui Mun Luo"" gel with the song's cosmopolitan shuffle; on the other, ""Harjun Takaa"" seems an attempt to embrace upwards-moving anthemic melodic structures, ending stuck on the tarmac instead. The misses scattered between Soita Mulle's hits make the album drag as a front-to-back listening experience-- and this record is nine tracks in under 35 minutes. Forget the cover art: the real tragedy about Soita Mulle is that Regina grab the brass ring of consistency for the first time in their career, and with excellent results-- they just can't seem to hold on the entire time.","On their fourth album, the Finnish indie pop trio offers a clean take on shoegaze highlighted by frontwoman Iisa Pykäri's improved vocals. Unfortunately, they still succumb to outside-the-lines genre explorations that don't always work.

Haven,CHLLNGR,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10213d197565213a56a/1:1/w_160/d555521b.jpg,2011-09-19 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15826-chllngr-haven/,Green Owl,"There's little argument that dubstep has bled into the mainstream. The pulsing electronic music offshoot that reared its head in South London in the early aughts has since gone global, and while it hasn't reached the same levels of notoriety as, say, hip-hop did in the mid 1980s (nor has it yet become subject to those same levels of commercialization and bastardization), the market is indeed flooded. Enter Steven Borth, a Copenhagen-by-way-of-California musician who records as the trendily monikered, all-caps-no-vowels CHLLNGR, best known for his cavernous, doom-drunk remix of the xx's ""Islands"". As with most artists that could be gathered under the shaky genre umbrella called dubstep, Borth has a few unique hallmarks to call his own, but you'd be safe in filing his debut LP, Haven, in the same section. In fact, if you were feeling generous, you could call Haven something of a primer for the uninitiated: Ticky-tacky drums, spectral moanings, and fuzz blurting synths all pockmark Borth's work, tweaked only enough on each individual track to make them distinguishable from one another. But for those who have explored the ever-splintering genre just a little will notice that, at its best, Haven is an inoffensive introduction that only feels comfortable modeling the most basic templates put forth by some of his more mood-conscious contemporaries. Which is to say it's a decent listen-- no one is going to call out Borth for not knowing what he's doing, as he occasionally drums up some creative pieces of programming-- but at a time when the most enjoyable and exciting voices within the movement are challenging people's notions of what this expanding niche is and can be, Haven seems to aim directly for the lowest common denominator. When Borth has some rhythm behind him, he has little trouble hitting the right sweet spots. Between the single-worthy ""Ask For"", which feels practically low-rider ready, and ""Out of Your Hands"" (boasting a pleasingly rickety snap), it's clear that he's struck a movement-motivated creative spark. But more often than not, it's those boilerplate creepings and ethereal purrings that take precedent. Where these spine-tingling atmospherics have been known to raise pulses (Burial seems to be an important touchstone on Haven), Borth's simplistic poaching feels lifeless. Not to mention that most songs hover within the three-minute mark, making Borth look insecure in his ability to set a tone or expand an idea beyond its repetitive base. Perhaps even more staid are the ways in which vocals are handled. Borth is clearly interested in voices (Dragons of Zynth's Aku and Coco O. of Quadron both make appearances), but too often they're flavorlessly integrated. The real-live guests don't provide the dynamic dimension needed to pop against these backdrops, while the familiarly pitch-shifted cries and coos only draw attention to the fact that, thanks to their overuse, this cybernetic brand of vocal manipulation seems to be verging on the parodic. But Haven is no parody, nor is it a carelessly made record-- it's simply a late entry that tugs the same strings, only to lesser effect. At a time when everyone else around Borth is pushing themselves forward, sitting pretty in the starting gate isn't the most effective strategy.","Best known for his cavernous, doom-drunk remix of the xx's ""Islands"", Copenhagen-via-California musician Steven Borth's debut LP is something of a dubstep primer for the uninitiated.

Veronica Falls,Veronica Falls,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f4c0084474cd0c1d31/1:1/w_160/f13935b4.jpg,2011-09-19 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15818-veronica-falls-veronica-falls/,SlumberlandBella Union,"At the end of the video for Veronica Falls' ""Bad Feeling"", Roxanne Clifford, the group's bob-haired singer/guitarist, clad in a dashingly fey polka-dot blouse, picks up an antique book-- the ultimate twee signifier-- and lights it on fire. Given indie rock's recent jangle-pop overload, and the comments that Veronica Falls have made in the press (""people like to romanticize about C86 [but] there were lots of rubbish bands associated with it...""), it's tempting to wonder aloud: is ""Bad Feeling"" the C86 version of that video where George Michael goes iconoclastic on us and sets his own leather jacket ablaze? Well, maybe not, but at the very least it's a decent visual metaphor for the band's sound: expertly stagy revivalism with the slightest hint of mutiny. You could have said the same thing of Slumberland labelmates and fellow fresh-faced indie poppers the Pains of Being Pure at Heart when they first burst out the gates with Pastels badges on their sleeves-- the quartet's self-titled debut hits with the same sort of immediacy that that first Pains LP did. Both records do familiar things so well that, occasionally, momentarily, they actually trick you into thinking you've never heard anything like them before. But, of course, you have. In fact, if you've been paying any attention to Glasgow/London hybrid Veronica Falls, you've actually heard some of these very songs before: The single ""Found Love in a Graveyard"" made the rounds almost two years ago, and then came ""Beachy Head"", ""Bad Feeling"", and ""Come on Over"" earlier this year. But after a run of strong 7""'s, their self-titled debut finally confirms that Veronica Falls are more than a singles band. Though they operate with a pretty limited sonic palette (boy/girl harmonies; dueling, reverb-drenched guitars; lots of tambourine), there's a sustained momentum over these 12 tracks that even manages to bring in some unexpected influences-- ""Beachy Head"" sounds like a zombified Mamas and the Papas thrashing at surf-punk guitars with shards of glass. Given the group's penchant for ghosts and reverb, it's tempting to grab for a familiar collection of low-hanging adjectives: dreamy, ethereal, haunting-- except that, actually, Veronica Falls is none of these things. There's a striking physicality to these songs, and Guy Fixsen and Ash Workman's production makes every tambourine beat hit with the clarity of a shattering window. The guitar sound is immaculate: Clifford and James Hoare's strings don't jangle so much as bristle-- taut chords that dart restlessly in and out of each other's way. There's a clarity of texture-- a specificity even-- to every element of the band's sound. Which makes it something of an anomaly: shoegaze that looks you square in the eye. Thematically speaking, shit's dark. There's a song called ""Misery"", there are not one but two songs in which the narrator's lover might be a ghost (""Graveyard"", ""Bad Feeling""), and though ""Beachy Head"" might sound like a carefree postcard from indie rock's current backdrop of choice, it's actually about jumping off a cliff and drowning yourself. Thankfully, the record ends on a high in every sense: ""Come on Over"" is perhaps the most hopeful-- and best-- track the band's got to their name. ""Crimson and clover, I'll touch your shoulder,"" Clifford sings over the mounting tension of a furiously strummed guitar. It's the Veronica Falls aesthetic in miniature: the ghosts of pop past conjured convincingly and intimately enough to feel like flesh and blood.","On its Slumberland debut, the London boy/girl indie-pop quartet churns out expertly stagy revivalism with the slightest hint of mutiny, creating shoegaze that looks you square in the eye.

In a roundabout way, that sums up the North Carolinian trio pretty well: attempting the familiar, arriving at the unexpected. Though their latest LP, the sanguine, self-titled Megafaun, dials back on the clawhammer outbursts and and out-from-nowhere harmonic blasts that peppered their earlier work, they're still reliably surprising, their sleepily shapeshifting folk-rock quietly but confidently winding its way through the annals of American music. That the sinewy Zappa-esque whirlaway of ""Isadora"" and the twinkly Horsnby-esque exhalation ""Hope You Know"" (very nearly the Bruce nod their former DeYarmond Edison bandmate Bon Iver's ""Beth/Rest"" was) sit comfortably next to each other on Megafaun should tell you a lot about just how expansive their outlook is these days. Outliers abound, but they downplay the rustic instrumentation of their earlier LPs for a more traditional, country-rock setup. The overarching sound's got more than a little bit in common with the Grateful Dead's more pastoral moments, all manners of harmony-kissed American beauty that never quite land where you thought they might. From the patiently unfurling opener ""Real Slow"" to rousing gospel closer ""Everything"", Megafaun trudge over a terrific amount of sonic ground here without restlessness. This serene, settled-in sound mostly feels like a trade-up; they manage a consistency of tone and texture here they've never shown before. As singers, alone and apart, they've never sounded better, and the record's subtler, less showy instrumentation and more reeled-in compositions suggest a newfound maturity that they wear exceptionally well. Hints of Southern smoke, Laurel Canyon folk, and hippie-country still inform their sound, but in their easygoing way, it never feels as if you're being led through a tour of the touchstones; the band's drowsy melodies and taut songcraft keep individual moments arresting, while their knack for slippery sonic detail (guitar twinkle, field recordings, the occasional banjo), the record's languid pacing, and its surplus of strange, striking melodies holds its hour-long expanse together. That generous runtime does prove to be Megafaun's only real downside; save ""Everything"", Megafaun's standout moments seem to come in its first half, excising Delta moaner ""Scorned"" and a few of the wispier, late-LP country-rockers probably would've further boosted cohesion. Minor complaints, really; here, Megafaun have quietly completed the smart, sizable stylistic shift they started on last fall's Heretofore EP, drawing back on the burly backwoods weirdness of their earlier work while widening their stylistic scope and pushing compositional delicacy to the forefront. And Megafaun may be their most immediately ingratiating, rewarding LP yet, as well-suited for a night strapped into headphones as it is a lazy Sunday morning, dancing around the bedroom, munching casually on a pasta breakfast.","The shapeshifting North Carolinian folk-rock trio's new self-titled LP dials back on the clawhammer outbursts and out-from-nowhere harmonic blasts that peppered the band's earlier work, but still offers plenty of surprises.

Life Sux EP,Wavves,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b100b1335d7bf169a1e8/1:1/w_160/1726f01f.jpg,2011-09-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15827-life-sux-ep/,Ghost Ramp,"King of the Beach was a quantum leap for Wavves, but not so much for Nathan Williams. In the context of the monochrome, fuck-all noise of Wavvves, it was easier to stomach an attitude that hovered somewhere between high, hungover, and hateful. What pissed off a lot of people was the way he could broaden his sonic palette and galvanize his songwriting without even the slightest attitude adjustment: The world would have to start taking him seriously, and it was abundantly clear he had no plans to return the favor. So do you think the tsk-tsking of some critics or Marnie Stern is gonna stop him? In case you missed the point of King of the Beach's opening salvo, here's Williams on ""I Wanna Meet Dave Grohl"": ""You're still never gonna stop me."" As such, his follow-up EP is titled Life Sux, it features some of his more famous friends cheering him on, and Williams treats the inaugural release on his Ghost Ramp label like a 24-year old's first apartment: Maybe you'd only want to spend 15 minutes tops in this ramshackle mess, but hey, he's enjoying his freedom. At the very least, you know where you stand with Wavves: If you're not referenced by name or actually appear on Life Sux, there's a good shot you're a target of Williams' limitless disdain. So then, ""Bug"": He's cool with Dinosaur Jr., whether he's paying homage with some of his mostly instantly catchy fuzz guitar leads, or just pissing in the wind about the futility of relying on other people. Meanwhile, ""I Wanna Meet Dave Grohl"" follows in the grand tradition of Local H's ""Eddie Vedder"" (if not ""I Had Mark Arm"") in terms of grunge fan fiction fueled by overblown ego and non-existent self-esteem. He switches ""meet"" with ""be"" during the brainwash of a chorus, which brings out this strange humanizing quality even though the premise doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense: Whose life ambition is it to meet or even be Dave Grohl when he's quite possibly the squarest dude that qualifies as an actual rock star? Is it because ""Krist Novoselic"" has too many syllables and doesn't rhyme with anything? Unfortunately, when his tributes to the Buzz Bin become less overt but no less pervasive, Side B of Life Sux, well, kinda sux: The title of ""Poor Lenore"" is the first time Williams has implied he's ever picked up a book in his life, but the turgid, 3rd-gen grunge suggests he found that Poe anthology right next to a used copy of Frogstomp. And though ""Destroy"" is a well-intentioned collaboration in the name of break-shit punk, once Pink Eyes' vocals give Williams the bum's rush, it ceases to have the ability to be heard as anything other than a lo-fi Fucked Up track. If you ever wondered if those dozens of guitar overdubs were really necessary on David Comes to Life, ""Destroy"" emphatically answers in the affirmative. Despite its reduced scope, Life Sux is actually pretty versatile depending on where you stand with Wavves-- take it as further confirmation of his permanent immaturity, or a sign that rattling off rudimentary but undeniably hooky punk-pop comes fairly easy to him. Still, with an LP supposedly on its way by the end of the year, you don't have to wonder quite yet if using the brat factor as something of a crutch means that he already reached his ceiling and King of the Beach is the record he was put on this earth to make: one that Weezer couldn't make after they'd discovered branding, Blink-182 couldn't after they thought owning Cure albums meant they had to be taken seriously as artistes, and Green Day couldn't after Billie Joe picked up a copy of No Logo. Unsurprisingly, the track that gets him out of the artistic cul-de-sac is by far the best thing here: Crazy for You and King of the Beach coyly flirted with addressing the real-life relationship of its creators, and Williams' collaboration with Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino on ""Nodding Off"" doesn't get much into detail either. Still, it threatens to make even the most jaded Hipster Runoff devotee actually root for them: think Best Coast with more power, Wavves with more pop, or just a more reckless, less cerebral New Pornographers. Of course, even if the heart of Life Sux is a gooey escape fantasy featuring his girlfriend, if he still wants to describe the EP as something you'll probably like ""if you hate yourself and other people""... well, you're never gonna stop him.","Nathan Williams treats his Ghost Ramp label's inaugural release, an EP featuring guest spots from Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino and Fucked Up's Damian Abraham, like a 24-year old's first apartment: Maybe you'd only want to spend 15 minutes in this ramshackle mess, but hey, he's enjoying his freedom.

Some Easy Magic,Fungi Girls,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cc5e6ef9596932201d/1:1/w_160/f105a4e9.jpg,2011-09-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15799-some-easy-magic/,HoZac,"When delving into the backstory of Fungi Girls, the word ""precocious"" comes to mind. This is not to say they're sheet-reading music theory nerds worshipping Philip Glass, but you do get the feeling that the members of this particular trio-- none of them old enough to legally buy cigarettes in America-- are well beyond their years. Of course, they're teenagers in the 21st century: They've had far greater access to underground music than older fans. Regardless, it's not a stretch to say a group that got together in their preteens and who credit 13th Floor Elevators and ? and the Mysterians as influences should rightfully be considered as having advanced tastes. Since forming, the Texans have shared stages with Hunx and his Punx and Wavves. They've recorded ""Dream of Oz"", the best Jesus and Mary Chain song since Liars' ""Freak Out"". They've garnered praise from the likes of Psychedelic Horseshit's Matt Whitehurst-- a man far more generous with insults than he is with compliments. It's easy to see why: Their debut LP, Seafaring Pyramids, was an infectious blast of noisy effects-pedal-rock, shoegaze for people who wear the same pair of holey, filthy Vans every day. Interestingly, the straightforward garage of sophomore collection Some Easy Magic serves as a complete stylistic overhaul. Instrumental opener ""Sabana Breeze"" and vintage toe-tapper ""Honey Face"" are good enough songs, but the album doesn't really kick into gear until about 12 seconds into the title track, where the descending chords and boundless energy is reminiscent of the threadbare, hanging-off-the-hinges rock of garage punk legends Thee Oh Sees. Only, where most bands (Thee Oh Sees included) would use a song like this to fulfill every garage-rock frontman's desire to howl at the moon and spit beer all over the microphone, vocalist Jacob Bruce sings an addictive melody in his best inside voice, turning what would normally be a chaotically fun moment into a tightly wound ball of nervous tension. As a singer, Bruce never really goes for the jugular on the record: Each song is marked by his calmly and effortlessly spouting off brilliantly simple melody after brilliantly simple melody, employing vocal restraint where you'd least expect it. Like most well-adjusted small-town teenagers, his lyrics are often about boredom (""nothing to do"" is a combination of words used more than once on the album), and he aptly delivers them with a disaffected croon, bored to the point of numbness. This would normally be a red-flag, but Bruce has such a natural flair for melody that the songs quickly burrow into your head. When he steps away from the mic for the album's instrumentals, there's a vibe-heavy presence-- like entering a dive bar where folks go because it has cheap pitchers and a functioning jukebox. Garage-rock is the province of the young and the young-at-heart. How else can you explain the slovenly strummed chords that feel like a sloppy, drunken kiss? Or the barreling drums not as concerned with fancy fills as they are the simple task of sorta keeping tempo? Or the romance of sweat, spilled beer, spitting in the air, and catching it with your mouth? Garage has always been a genre that's gotten by on fuck-all primitivism and giddy demolition. (There's a reason Shayde Sartin of the Fresh & Onlys cites Personal and the Pizzas as the platonic ideal of garage-rock bands.) The peculiar thing about Some Easy Magic is how efficiently it's delivered, how its players work through their songs like a trio of cool session players rather than pack of bloodthirsty punk kids-- especially when considering that most of the wilder bands they've played shows with are easily double their age. But their natural introvertedness doesn't hinder their ability to play simple but exhaustively catchy tunes, nor does it take away from the fact that Some Easy Magic is one of the most enjoyable garage albums of the year, a pure-pop record for the Terminal Boredom set. With as much promise as this record exhibits, it's scary to ponder how good they'll be once they're old enough to drink in the bars they've played in.","No one in this restrained-beyond-their-ages Texas garage-rock trio's old enough to legally buy cigarettes, but you get the feeling they are well beyond their years. Their sophomore collection offers a complete stylistic overhaul.

Paradise,Slow Club,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ef9d034d5c69bf4951/1:1/w_160/7dd5b39a.jpg,2011-09-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15823-paradise/,Moshi Moshi,"Slow Club's first album, Yeah So, was a twee, hyper-romantic delight, full of charming little indie folk songs ideally suited to mix tapes and teen television soundtracks. The Sheffield, England duo could have kept going in that direction indefinitely with potentially great commercial rewards, but instead they've opted to make a second album, Paradise, which dials down their perky sweetness and emphasizes rhythm and atmosphere with lyrics confronting more emotionally complicated subject matter. This isn't to say that Slow Club have become unrecognizable. One of the most impressive things about Paradise is the way the band have retained so much of their character while shifting their tone considerably. A few of the songs here-- the rollicking ""Where I'm Waking"" and the wistful ""Hackney Marsh""-- would have made sense on Yeah So, but for the most part, the melodic and lyrical sensibility of that record has been filtered through a different set of influences. There is still a sweetness to their sound, but it's balanced out with a range of more difficult emotions and a darker tonal palette. The most drastic difference between Yeah So and Paradise is that Charles Watson and Rebecca Taylor have largely abandoned close harmonies. Instead, Taylor has asserted herself as the dominant vocalist, with her voice taking the lead on nearly every track, while Watson provides complementary harmonies or focuses on his guitar. This was a brilliant decision on their part. Watson has a pleasant tenor, but Taylor's voice is much more colorful and expressive. Though she supplied the high points of previous singles ""Trophy Room"" and ""Giving Up on Love"", her vocal performances through Paradise are a revelation: Her phrasing is consistently thoughtful and surprising, full of subtle cues that invest her straightforward lyrics with remarkable depth much in the same way a great actress can draw rich character detail out of a threadbare script. Taylor's best performances-- and not coincidentally, Paradise's two best songs-- take her voice in very different directions.  The ballad ""You, Earth, or Ash"" is so stark and delicate that her voice often seems naked, barely accompanied by the minimal plucking of Watson's guitar. She sounds wounded and fragile, but her tone is very adult and dignified; she gracefully transitions from moments of self-assured beauty to sounding as though she could spontaneously break down into tears. She is more girlish on ""Two Cousins"", the set's percussion-heavy opener, leaning hard on her upper register and reaching up further still to underscore particularly anguished lines. The song, about a pair of estranged family members, cycles through two choruses-- the first one carried by a trebly, diagonal synthesizer part and the second more focused on her voice, which rings out with heart-breaking clarity as she sings the tune's gutting conclusion: ""I look into your eyes/ You don't know who I am."" In both songs, and throughout Paradise, Slow Club display remarkable skill in tugging at heartstrings, but they do it without being particularly manipulative or overly saccharine. Led along by Taylor's confident voice, the duo has evolved from being among the best of an indie pop field overcrowded with cutesy duos to carving out a distinct niche for itself that opens up further opportunities for creative growth.","The Sheffield duo's sophomore album dials down its predecessor's twee, hyper-romantic delight in favor of songs that emphasize rhythm and atmosphere, with lyrics confronting more emotionally complicated subject matter. But that's not the most drastic shift.

"It Can Be Done, But Only I Can Do It",Omar S,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ee13d197565213a548/1:1/w_160/5106b30a.jpg,2011-09-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15821-it-can-be-done-but-only-i-can-do-it/,FXHE,"The last time I saw Omar S DJ, I was in a coffee shop in downtown Detroit drinking screwdrivers out of 5-oz plastic cups. We'd shown up early to an afterparty for the Movement Electronic Music Festival, Detroit's big-for-America electronic-music showcase. On arrival there were 15 old heads dancing to a pre-Omar set on a still coffee-shop-y dance floor, tables and chairs tucked neatly into corners. The booze, we were told, was in the back, and we were led by an elderly woman past the employees-only area, behind the DJ booth to a folding table with three handles of Popov, four cartons of orange juice, and a donations shoebox (these somewhat unofficial venues being legally unable to charge for drinks). Omar (Alex O. Smith) probably wasn't intimately involved in that night's planning, but he could've been. Everything about the long-running house producer feels local and homemade (to wit: when his self-run label FXHE Records finally released t-shirts last year, the design was a ""D""-- for Detroit, presumably-- fashioned out of 12"" labels; he wore one at that coffee shop). It Can Be Done, But Only I Can Do It is Omar's second full-length for FXHE; his profile-raising mix for London's Fabric club and his recent (free) High School Graffiti EP for, of all companies, Scion (last time he bothered talking to the press, Omar worked for Ford) notwithstanding, he still prefers to release his music at his pace, for his label. Omar's style remains his own: construction-paper house, dance music in which the materials seem crude but the product is crafty and confident. He operates differently from most producers, worrying little about mood or architecture. Omar remains refreshingly uninterested in the unspoken pissing contest that is every producer's attempt to make the ""deepest"" record in the DJ crate. The core elements of any given Omar track-- modest, cymbal-heavy rhythms, orbital synth lines-- are those necessary to inspire them most movement with the least cognitive interference. His music isn't soulful by way of signifiers-- though he does feature the occasional Motown sample or muffled diva-- it's soulful via its hardscrabble grooves and undeniable mettle. He isn't interested in replication, in tuning knobs until he has the finest approximation of a Rhodes piano or sawing strings; every element here is slightly indelicate, remnants of its synthesis scattered about. You aren't meant to recognize the elements of Omar's music; you're meant to dance to them. Though obviously indebted to artists like Theo Parrish (a frequent collaborator) and Carl Craig, one of the greatest achievements of It Can Be Done is how easily it avoids feeling retro. Nor, though, does it imagine the future; It Can Be Done is the rare techno/house album that feels inimitably of its own time. This is born of Omar's indelible style, the way he dials rhythms into his sequences and lets trace hints of melody come to him. They always do, too: the title track finds a vaguely Kraftwerk-ian groove-hook, while ""Supported Solely"" casually alternates between prickly treble and roiling bass. When he does offer a transparent genre plug-- ""Here's Your Trance Now Dance""-- he does so with verve and enthusiasm: ""Trance"" is 10-plus minutes of uncharacteristically major-key sunshine. It's all too simple to tie Omar's sound to his native city (if not necessarily its trad dystopian techno sound): both offer utility in the face of style and a shabbiness that's easy to love for those of the right disposition. Maybe he likes it this way-- he certainly seems smart enough to change this perception (though whether he is aware enough is up for debate). It Can Be Done won't increase Omar's stature or change the landscape of electronic music; he is a cantankerous, secluded (by choice) artist, arrogant enough to make music for himself but expecting you to dance to you it. Those patient enough to play by his rules probably will. (Note: Omar's distribution is notoriously spotty; the best place to find his music, especially on CD, is through the FXHE website.)","On Omar S's second self-released album-- the rare techno/house album that feels inimitably of its own time-- the Detroit native remains refreshingly uninterested in the unspoken pissing contest that is every producer's attempt to make the ""deepest"" record in any given DJ crate.

Portamento,The Drums,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0dfea9e61561daa66b9/1:1/w_160/db20d8a2.jpg,2011-09-16 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15807-portamento/,FrenchkissMoshi Moshi,"Like any good TNT show, the Drums know drama. At the tail end of 2010, guitarist Adam Kessler left the band under circumstances that were clearly less than amicable; the band's website stated that the remaining members were ""devastated"" and were ""keeping to themselves and friends at this time."" Two weeks later, lead singer Jonathan Pierce told NME that the band had composed ""the best song we've ever written"" the day after Kessler's departure. It was only a few months' time before Pierce was referring to Kessler's departure as a ""blessing in disguise"" in UK newspaper The Independent: ""We don't know what he's doing or anything. I'm not interested in knowing what he's up to."" In the leadup to the release of the Drums' second album, Portamento, Pierce has sounded dismissive of the band's general career trajectory, claiming that they don't ""have a very long shelf life as a band"" and that they came close to breaking up this past June following ""a lot of shouting matches."" Accordingly, that grim outlook is reflected in their most recent work. Throughout Portamento's 12 songs, there are 11 references to death or dying, the most notable arriving on ""Days"" when Pierce testifies to his past devotion to a broken relationship by casually tossing out the revelation that he ""killed myself."" Obsessing over mortality is nothing new in indie pop, let alone within the Drums' catalog thus far. Remember, this is a band whose first album kicked off with a song called ""Best Friend"" that started like this: ""You were my best friend/ And then you died."" Clearly, Pierce's ego has been well-fed-- his recent quote-worthy nature in the press reflects that of the leader of a prototypical British buzz band (fittingly, despite Brooklyn ties, the UK has welcomed the band with open arms, more so than the States). Which is why it's surprising that Portamento sounds and feels like a smaller, more intimate album than last year's self-titled predecessor. After all, it's not like they did anything drastically different this time around-- like The Drums, Portamento was largely recorded in a band member's apartment (Pierce's), as well as a few studios in NYC and upstate Woodstock. (For those who bemoaned the production value of the first LP, be warned: Portamento very much sounds like it was recorded in someone's apartment.) The lack of ""bigness"" on Portamento most likely owes to the fact that the Drums aren't on a major label anymore (in the U.S., anyway). Here in the States, they've gone to Frenchkiss, a more suitable home considering its strong roster of bands-that-sound-like-a-lot-of-bands. In case you haven't noticed by now, the Drums do sound like a lot of bands, taking in everything from the Beach Boys' controlled falsettos to the loving cloyingness of late Swedish indie-pop greats the Honeydrips. As it turns out, the new surroundings are more beneficial for them: There's not as much pressure to be extroverted for the sake of courting a larger audience. This means that there's no ""Me and the Moon"" or ""Forever and Ever Amen""-- two big, great songs that would sound too anthemic and overblown if they were on this record. In the place of anthems, though, are carefully constructed gems making up a sequencing run so solid it takes a few listens to pick out the exact drop-off point (""In the Cold"", in case you were wondering). From the saxes and Theremin-like squeal in ""What You Were"" to the heart-tugging kickoff of ""Hard to Love"", it's the small, detailed moments that take you by surprise here-- kind of like life, really. And, despite all the drama and tortured sentiments, that's what the Drums are all about: real life, and the pains and pleasures (mostly pains) that come along with loving while you still have fresh breath in your lungs. Yes, Pierce talks about selling a gun in ""Money"", but the song is basically about how he doesn't have enough money to buy a lover a nice present. Being broke (and feeling inadequate because of that) is something we can all relate to, no matter how embarrassing it might be for a bunch of major-label refugees to admit. It's time to stop begrudging these guys for being stylish and faddish, because real emotions like the ones they work in are ugly and petty and hard to bear in public. You can get as many haircuts and buy as many trendy outfits as you want, but you're not going to change the fact that it'll never be cool to feel upset, angry, and alone.","Despite the well-fed egos, Jonathan Pierce and co.'s new album-- one that features ugly, petty, real emotion and multiple references to death or dying-- is a smaller, more intimate record than last year's self-titled predecessor.

Relax,Das Racist,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f5b1335d7bf169a1d7/1:1/w_160/46d461c5.jpg,2011-09-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15822-relax/,Greedhead,"Das Racist always come off as being at least two steps ahead of whomever they're addressing on or off record, which goes a long way toward explaining what made their 2010 mixtapes, Sit Down, Man and Shut Up, Dude, so inexhaustibly fresh and frankly pretty fucking intimidating to encounter as a critic. A style so reliant on self-reference and continuity doesn't appear to leave much to coincidence, so I'm wondering what to make of my suspicions regarding a line that appeared on both of their completely free mixtapes, but not their first commercially available release: ""You should probably buy it."" This isn't wholly unexpected-- Heems, Kool AD, and Dapwell can appear unimpressed to a fault, and Relax draws from a rich tradition of antisocial reactions to newfound fame: at times, it's a sour demystification that seeks to define its own backlash à la De La Soul Is Dead, at others a simplified CliffsNotes for people still playing catch up, and a lot of times it simply wants to be Bazooka Tooth. But even as jaded as they sound toward show promoters, industry types, your band, and white dudes on the internet, Relax is a frustrating, occasionally thrilling record that saves its most pervasive indifference for a far more troubling target: itself. Though they've had plenty of laughs at backpacker indie rap's expense, Relax comes alive whenever it strives for an honorary Def Jux badge. El-P and Danny Brown are the most notable appearances, and what's initially jarring is how much the otherwise impermeable Das Racist universe accommodates a sound that caters more toward its guests' respective dystopian styles, forsaking the weeded-out levity of Sit Down and Shut Up for industrial grind fueled by cheap coke and battery acid. At the outset, they keep up as the brittle title track finds Heems adopting a rawer style to spit a bracing, strikingly plainspoken verse about his upbringing. Meanwhile, ""Michael Jackson"" pays homage to the Chinese fire drill productions of Heatmakerz and AraabMuzik, its brainwashing hook reminiscent of ""Dipset (Santana's Town)""'s infamous ""like Kurt Cobain was here!"" in terms of chantable celebrity nonsense. When Relax revisits this sort of bludgeoning approach (""Selena"", ""Punjabi Song""), you sense the incomplete framework of a record meant to be aesthetically unified and audience-dividing: ""Michael Jackson"" and the other initially punishing tracks shuttle from ""I absolutely cannot stand this song"" to ""I absolutely cannot get this song out of my head"" in about the same amount of time ""Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell"" did. While it would be fascinating to see how their style translates with a mainstream feature (a la Tyler, the Creator's guest spots with Pusha T and the Game), the retrenchment into their inner circle for inspiration rarely feels reactionary here: Yeasayer's Anand Wilder and Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij produce, but without credit, you'd have no idea which tracks are theirs. Likewise, their exercise in total lyrical abstraction with El-P comes more naturally than Sit Down, Man's title track, and ""Power"" is maybe the one track here that can stand up to jaw-dropping quote machines like ""hahahaha jk?"" or ""Return to Innocence"" thanks to show-stealing verses from Danny Brown and Despot. And yet, it's the hook from ""Power"" that gets to the discomforting center of Relax: ""It's too easy. Even if I told you about it, you probably wouldn't even believe me."" Like many highly intelligent people who can succeed in any number of pursuits, Das Racist sound unimpressed by their own staggering ability (Heems' much-quoted ""I'm fucking great at rapping!"" from ""Michael Jackson"" notwithstanding), as if they got to this point just to see if they could do it, and all of a sudden the actual process of making Relax didn't turn out to be as exciting as planning it. Adopting the same over-it tone they've taken during any number of clueless ""hey, these funny guys are really smart!"" interviews, hooks like ""give us all your money... love everybody"" from ""Brand New Dance"" are the sound of their losing interest in real time. If they're kidding, it's an entry-level joke aimed at...I dunno, proactive behavior in hip-hop? But the disengaged tone starts to wear when it becomes unclear whether Kool AD and Heems are still interested in making rap music anymore as opposed to merely listening to it, rattling off disconnected thoughts not too different from the avalanche of their Twitter feeds-- stray jokes, pan-cultural namedrops, the occasional astute observation, and a slew of repurposed praise, but no real context to prove broader points. After delivering some of the sharpest cultural criticism in any field on Sit Down and Shut Up, when they swipe at low-hanging fruit like ""rapgenius.com is white devil sophistry/ Urban Dictionary is for demons with college degrees,"" there's little insight, just the whiff of audience/performer codependence. So then what's Shut Up, Dude's ""Rainbow in the Dark"" doing here? It's still a mindblowing piece of work and welcome in any form, but the fit couldn't be more strange-- both the beat and the lyrics have a generosity in spirit that sheds light on an issue that you can lose sight of while focusing on its attitude or production choices: they're hardly rapping at all here. And when they do, it's almost like 10th-season The Simpsons, where the sheer dropoff in quotability is actually uncomfortable to endure. It's understandable that they'd want to move beyond mere applause for being as handy with Marina Abramovic as they are with Rick Ross' ""9 Piece"", but they've thrown out their entirely unique point of view-- still their greatest resource-- with it. While they've made great use of deconstructive syntax, repetition, gibberish, and in-jokes in the past, too much of Relax simply feels like dead air: the clock-watching countdown of ""Happy Rappy"", the last minute and a half of the title track that sounds like a cackling Autotune meeting its death in a food processor, ""Celebration"" and ""The Trick""'s listless singing, and ""Punjabi Song"" tripping over its drunk reiteration all merely pass time during tracks already stripped to the bone on a very short record. And while I won't begrudge Das Racist for wanting to make straight-up dance tracks like ""Girl"" or ""Booty in the Air"", compared to ""Shorty Said"", ""Irresponsible"", or the many other songs they've made that worked as well in Gchat nerd-out sessions as they did in house parties, it's tough to give these one-note riffs the benefit of the doubt. They can do better, but do they even want to?

Chartreuse Bull,Vaz,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f1b1335d7bf169a1ce/1:1/w_160/8e75d517.jpeg,2011-09-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15804-vaz-chartreuse-bull/,Sleeping Giant Glossolalia,"In a recent issue of the Village Voice, an article by music journalist Christopher R. Weingarten suggested that New York City was in the midst of a ""pigfuck"" renaissance. The colorful term was first coined by critic Robert Christgau as a way to describe the misanthropic ruckus created by mid-1980s indie rock progenitors like Sonic Youth, Big Black, and the Butthole Surfers, among others. Weingarten revived the term in honor of a handful of like-minded New York area groups like the Men and White Suns. Brooklyn-based Vaz are another fine band in this sphere, but a couple of things separate them from their name-checked contemporaries. For one, the group has been around for over a decade, though Bull marks both their first album in five years and their first album as a trio. Second, before Vaz was formed, its members were part of a musical institution that helped shape the sound that's slowly coming back into vogue. Back in the 1990s, members of Vaz were in North Dakota trio Hammerhead. While they weren't able to cash in for big bucks like Helmet, or stick around long enough to achieve elder-statesmen status like the Melvins, Hammerhead did carve out their own neglected little niche, albeit in a fashion that had more in common with their Touch and Go contemporaries-- Shellac, Jesus Lizard, etc.-- than any of their kissing cousins on AmRep. When two-thirds of Hammerhead-- vocalist/guitarist Paul Erickson and drummer Jeff Moordian-- went on to form Vaz following the former's break-up, they hit the ground running on 2001's Demonstrations in Micronesia. Displaying a melodic knack that Hammerhead only hinted at, and managing to punch even harder despite not having a bassist, the album found the duo nearly matching the ferocity and focus of their Load Records labelmates Lightning Bolt, all while barbing their hooks with just the right amount of paranoia and menace (thanks to Erickson's reverb-and-doom-laden vocal stylings). Such an accomplishment, coming when it did, earned them the adoration of a passionate few and, sadly, little else. Their subsequent releases, prior to Bull, didn't pack nearly the same punch, exchanging the stylistic precision of their first album for a hit-and-miss see-what-happens wanderlust that, while enjoyable in its own right, wasn't nearly as effective-- check out ""Give Us the Creeps"", from Dying to Meet You, for one such oddball digression. If the raucous and raunchy Bull takes after any previous Vaz record, it's thankfully Micronesia*.* With second guitarist Tyler Nolan as its third member, the band muddies up their sound in the best possible way. The album comes off like it was recorded for a cassette release, but that sonic crudeness is a plus in this scenario. Nolan and Erickson don't complement each other as guitar players so much as antagonize or taunt. When Moordian enters the fray, he does so with reckless abandon, setting a breakneck pace that he's seemingly perpetually in danger of losing. Yet despite of all these chaotic collisions, Vaz never veers off-course, instead banging out no-hold-barred rock tunes that mete their righteous fury with a sense of song. They're still nowhere near being the Next Big Thing, but with this record getting slightly more exposure, and with a slew of like-minded contemporaries banging the same drum, there's a good chance another Vaz album might come a little quicker next time.","Now a trio, the Hammerhead-associated New York noise-rockers release their first album in five years, just in time for the ""pigfuck"" renaissance.

Blueprint: The Best of 808 State,808 State,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fdb1335d7bf169a1e3/1:1/w_160/32e712e6.jpg,2011-09-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15824-blueprint-the-best-of-808-state/,Salvo,"In the late 1980s, 808 State asked themselves a couple of important questions: Was it possible to get the masses to rise up and embrace instrumental beatscapes? Could a couple of guys with a couple of keyboards become a pop group without ever really writing pop songs? Should a house or techno act even bother releasing an album aimed at a general audience? There was no real evidence that the answer to any of these questions was ""yes,"" but 808, along with a handful of other ambitious crossover types, persisted anyway. Thanks to a mixture of luck, timing, and skill, 808 actually succeeded. And more than an any other crossover 1990s dance act, they stayed true to both their club and avant-electronic roots. The career-spanning Blueprint proves that 808 did have a certain commercial instinct almost from the start. What's more surprising is how big they scored with the stuff on Blueprint that sounds the least commercial. 808 came up in the early days of British rave by making intense and dense compositions that represented club music at its furthest-out, anticipating the kind of abstract hardcore electronica that didn't quite exist just yet. It's a thrillingly manic and claustrophobic sound, enough so that it inspired more than a few future IDM tyros. On the other hand, it's unsurprising that the caustic acid maximalism of ""Flow Coma"" never charted. 808's next single, however, hit in the biggest possible way. Relaxing a bit, like rave as a whole for a brief second, they scored massively with the platonically placid ""Pacific State"". The tune that helped to enshrine both the saxophone and the birdcall as part of the softer side of dance music's vocabulary, ""Pacific"" still has enough of techno's antic bounce to make it seem like a great lost direction for pop, where hippie relaxation vibes and bright video game funk are not incompatible. An accountant probably would have told them to ride their status as chill-out pioneers until it stopped being profitable, which could have lasted at least until Moby smothered the trend stone-dead with the success of Play. Instead 808 released a few charmingly clunky takes on hip-house that are left out on Blueprint. That certainly helps the collection's flow, even if it does underline why the group calls this their ""greatest bits"" rather than a complete overview. When they finally rebounded, creatively, it once again paid off commercially. ""Pacific"" and their Brit-rap adventures had clearly given them an appreciation for ideas of beauty and fun that conformed to 99 percent of humanity's. But they never quite lost their taste for the robots-in-meltdown fierceness of ""Flow Coma"". ""Cubik"" and ""In Yer Face"" were among the 808's biggest non-""Pacific"" hits, but they were also among their rawest tunes. The difference is that the intensity now felt brash and joyful rather than hermetic and kinda creepy. But the fact that one of 808's albums was called Gorgeous should give you an indication that their sympathies ultimately lay more with ""Pacific State"" than ""In Yer Face"". Gorgeousness as an end in itself sometimes led 808 to slick and forgettable tracks like ""Plan 9"", which has as much passion and inventiveness as the house-as-high-end-hotel-muzak they unfortunately helped inspire. But even ""Plan 9"" doesn't outstay its welcome. Early adopters of the ""radio edit"" approach to taking electronic dance into the mainstream, even 808's opulent ambient stuff almost always has an instrumental earworm to get you humming. So, in addition to being just damn listenable, front to back, Blueprint's also fascinating as a look at one group's answer to Brit dance culture's warring impulses in the 90s. 808's most memorable music is never split between opulent ambiance designed for the laid-back appreciation of connoisseurs and rugged slabs of computer madness to pump the adrenaline of young folks juiced on rave's novelty. The two are almost always mixed up into the same tunes, the wild beat constructions complimented by a real musical richness. That's probably why they've endured, while so many one-note singles from 808's peers have faded away.","This career-spanning ""greatest bits"" collection proves that-- without writing pop songs-- the ambitous 1990s British crossover dance act had a commercial instinct almost form the start, often scoring with the material that sounded the least sellable.

Feast or Famine EP,DaVinci,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fc5e6ef95969322064/1:1/w_160/4eb48bae.jpg,2011-09-15 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15819-feast-or-famine-ep/,SWTBRDS,"In the internet era, standing out from the hip-hop crowd often requires youthful immediacy, extreme novelty, and a willingness to throw anything at the wall in hopes that something sticks. This isn't a bad thing-- a lot of times, it's what makes keeping up with hip-hop so exciting. But confident artists, artists with a strong sense of self, should be celebrated for adhering to modest ambitions. If anything, in order to have a career that lasts these days, this kind of long-term consistency will become a necessity to combat the hype-backlash loop. Bay Area rapper DaVinci's new Feast or Famine EP, which follows last year's The Day the Turf Stood Still debut, is a release that refines an existing formula, relying on a distinctively wistful production aesthetic and the kind of rapping that feels like a labor of love, from an artist who sees hip-hop as a career. Party-rap single ""Beer, Bitches, & Bullshit"" is an immediate standout, although atypical of the record's sound: Over chugging production, DaVinci is joined by scene-stealing Roach Gigz and rapper C-Plus for a song about drunken misadventures. But the bulk of the record has a glossy, carefully-crafted professional sheen. As on his previous record, his vocals are proficiently musical. He has a sixth sense for rhythm and rhyme patterns, which largely overcomes a vocal style that otherwise operates as a detached flatline. As on The Day the Turf Stood Still, his lyrics offer a lot to close reading, if you're that type of rap fan. His worldview is thoughtful and nostalgic, affecting a nuanced sense of melancholy one moment balanced with hopefulness the next. This is a step up from his previous release primarily because of the production. Where The Day leaned on the predictable reliability (and ideological baggage) of classic boom-bap to frame DaVinci's lyrics, Feast or Famine has a more consistent, unique production style. In keeping with the relaxed pace of his music, the beats are svelte, all smoothed edges and rolling momentum. It conveys the immersive thrill of speeding down the highway with the windows up, the same feel of comfort and control, observing the passing images of an inescapable world outside. The record has a warm, welcoming feel but doesn't shy away from the kinds of real-world dilemmas of the thoughtful street rap archetype. It's an introspective, therapeutic quality, like the internal monologue of a person reflecting privately on the tangled problems he's been forced to confront. The album's climactic moment epitomizes this contradiction between lush comfort and the ugliness of the outside world. With a propulsive bassline and muted trumpet samples, the incredible ""Paying for my Past"" refers briefly to a life of drug dealing (""I used to hide my bundle in a laundromat lint trap..."") but primarily zooms in on the uglier side of drug addiction, a world where you most viscerally confront your past decisions on a regular basis. DaVinci's expressionless vocals help balance the emotive content of his words and the immediacy of the production, packing a wistful emotional punch.","The thoughtful Bay Area rapper follows his solid debut with an EP that refines his existing style, relying on a distinctively wistful production aesthetic and the kind of rapping that feels like a labor of love, from an artist who sees hip-hop as a career.

Hysterical,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0dd9d034d5c69bf4935/1:1/w_160/b04ccdd1.jpg,2011-09-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15805-hysterical/,self-released,"The majority of unsigned bands never have their failure to upend the music industry held against them, but... you already know the deal with Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. The excitement surrounding their 2005 self-titled debut and its DIY success was certainly warranted, but two years later, blogs were still grasping at straws for the sake of ""firsties,"" bands still wanted to get signed, and CYHSY's wildly uneven follow-up Some Loud Thunder all but acknowledged its impending backlash as a given. It was an alternately awkward and rewarding record, but at the very least, a heartening show of artistic gumption in light of hype-bubble peers such as Sound Team, Birdmonster, and Voxtrot essentially turning tail upon encountering the slightest bit of real scrutiny. And yet, after a five-year, self-imposed hiatus that's been described as something of a fact-finding mission for their true identity, Hysterical freely casts Clap Your Hands Say Yeah as the very thing their detractors inaccurately claimed them to be so long ago: a band whose story is the most interesting thing about them. Truth is, Hysterical feels self-conscious from the moment you press play. In that inimitable avian squawk of his, Alec Ounsworth crows, ""we'll make the same mistakes,"" and it's hard not to see it as winking irony since they're doing the exact opposite: Unlike their previous two records, Hysterical's opener doesn't boast some sort of abrasive production tactic meant to trigger instant buyer's remorse. In fact, ""Same Mistake"" actually sounds fantastic and emphasizes the elements of their sneaky anthemic streak-- Ounsworth's broad vocal strokes, a brisk rhythm of splashy, 16th-note hi-hats and insistently strummed guitars, all coated in a wash of synthesized strings that soothes like aftershave. It's instantly likeable, it can also just as easily be tuned out completely, and there are 11 others of its kind here. As hard as it is to believe that anything featuring a vocalist of Ounsworth's piercing timbre can be considered background music, Hysterical is almost hypnotic in its unerring consistency. You hire John Congleton as a producer, and you're all but guaranteed to sound amazing, but compared to his some of his well-known charges (St. Vincent, Bill Callahan, Shearwater), CYHSY work within a far narrower range of dynamics, tone, tempo, and instrumentation-- they sound like a more high-rent version of themselves, revealing how much ramshackle charm played a part in their debut, and that even the most jarring experiments from Some Loud Thunder were for their own good. If you've got a jones for no-qualifiers-necessary indie rock ca. 2005, you can get a proper fix from the title track, ""Idiot"", and ""Yesterday, Never"", where snares snap in double time, chords resolve in the most predictable fashion, and Ounsworth's melodies stride and stutter-step through familiar patterns. Still, it's tough to tell whether they impress on their own merits or whether they obtain some sort of halo effect due to their hard proximity to ""The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth"". So you're left to grasp for trimming: the horn charts on ""Maniac"" that shed Hysterical's rhythmic straitjacket and hearken to Ounsworth's New Orleans fetish from Mo Beauty, the humid Mellotron strings and puzzling melody on the lonely ""In a Motel"", the gnarled guitar that corkscrews it way through the middle of ""Into Your Alien Arms"". But if you cut Hysterical, what does it bleed? At the very least, you'd think ""Ketamine and Ecstasy"" or ""Misspent Youth"" would offer some sort of insight based on titles alone, and judging by a teasing Eurythmics quote or a stray line about ""trading sex for drugs,"" maybe they do. But the words themselves rarely linger for effect, instead getting smeared over by Ounsworth's oily melismatics and distended diction. Look, even those who fell hard for ""In This Home on Ice"" or ""Is This Love?"" wouldn't be too surprised by the way things would turn out by 2011-- Clap Your Hands Say Yeah may have a confrontational edge about them, but outside of straight-up indie rock, they're not the types you'd confuse for firebrands. The disappointment is in how it sounds like their years apart have needlessly chastened them into fast-forwarding through the idiosyncratic streak they showed on Some Loud Thunder instead of embracing it, coming out of the wilderness only to end up smack dab in the middle of the road.","After a five-year hiatus that's been described as something of a fact-finding mission for their true identity, Alec Ounsworth and co.'s third album casts them as the very thing their detractors claimed them to be so long ago.

Era Extraña,Neon Indian,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ecea9e61561daa66cb/1:1/w_160/8960015a.jpg,2011-09-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15817-era-extrana/,Mom + PopStatic Tongues,"Some people laugh at chillwave precisely because so many of its practitioners lack a sense of humor. But Alan Palomo is an exception. In 2009, the Texas-raised musician's Neon Indian project debuted with the excellent Psychic Chasms. Like a lot of young musicians, the then-21-year-old Palomo was inspired by Ariel Pink, and he certainly shared that art-pop oddball's sense of irreverence. Below the static and sneakily intricate synth patterns, Psychic Chasms was a funny, playful record, with goofy, drugged-out moments exemplified by song titles like ""Laughing Gas"". As the buzz around Psychic Chasms increased, the narrative shifted. Neon Indian attained a surprising level of popularity that was bolstered by a rocking, party-ready live show, drawing in fans of populist acts like Passion Pit and MGMT. After that raised profile, Neon Indian's second album, Era Extraña, shows a commitment to tighter, wide-reaching songcraft and appeal. The production value is at a higher level, with additional mixing by big-name studio guy Dave Fridmann (the Flaming Lips, MGMT), who forgoes his usual noise-bombing style for a more subtle approach. Those drawn to Psychic Chasms' warped view of pop or outré work like the difficult, abstract EP with the Flaming Lips last year may be disappointed; Era Extraña instead builds on Neon Indian's one-off single with Green Label Sound last year, the straightforward ""Sleep Paralysist"". Reflecting the shift, there's an increased focus on streamlined melodies; the vocal gasps and moans that streaked previous highs like ""Terminally Chill"" are still here, just not as suffocating. The wordless chorus of ""Hex Girlfriend"" is all but set to rock a festival stage or two, while ""Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)"" is a rush of life-affirming, upwards-moving melodic optimism. The music itself is intricate and accomplished, with dizzying layers of synth arrangements and stray sounds crammed into even the most big-tent cuts-- we're talking rocket-ship noises, phone conversations, lasers, and visceral video-game samples. Despite the kitchen-sink arrangements, the results are taut and defined. Palomo is anything but sloppy and he seems focused on the album as a unified whole: one of his finest songs yet, the melancholy, remix-ready ""Arcade Blues"", was given bonus-track status because he felt it didn't fit in with Era Extraña's overriding themes. Era Extraña is partly about love. It may not be ""breakup album,"" in the strictest sense, but the record sounds romantic and lovesick and looks toward sounds that bring these feelings to mind, from the sugary crunch of Isn't Anything-era My Bloody Valentine (""The Blindside Kiss"") to Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (""Fallout""). The feel of Era Extraña is expansive and lonely, like someone staring at the night sky in solitude (he recorded the bulk of it solo in Helsinki, Finland during the dead of winter, where, according to a recent Pitchfork interview, he was often on the verge of losing his shit mentally.) Another topic touched on in that interview was the album's sense of longing, and ""Future Sick"" conveys the feeling of growing older in a world that's growing faster than you are. Palomo bemoans having to look towards past the present under seasick synths, singing mid-volume under his own creation's drunken abstraction and promising to ""wake when things start to get peculiar"". Palomo feels more comfortable when looking to the past than turning his gaze to the uncertain future. While Era Extraña still contains the familiar warm glow of old television sets and half-remembered memories of the 1980s, Palomo is more than adept when utilizing short-term memory to evoke some of modern indie's more memorable 2000s-era fashions. The insistent pulse of ""Suns Irrupt"" is reminiscent of LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"", ""Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)"" is the near-double of M83's teenage epic ""Kim and Jessie"", and the sweetly lackadaisical verse structure of ""Polish Girl"" recalls the similarly unspooling inner monologue that runs through Stars' ""Reunion"". Coincidentally, those three songs of the not-so-distant past all deal with the loss of something-- a friend, youth, and irresponsible love, respectively. Amidst the bleepy synths and swooning melodies, Palomo's simply attempting not to lose himself, as he sighs through processed vocal effects on ""Suns Irrupt"": ""Gone/ But I'm waiting to be someone."" Two albums in, he remains a compelling songwriter. The scrappy charm of Psychic Chasms was hugely appealing from the jump and its brilliant initial flash faded just slightly over time. This is a far more serious record than its predecessor, but Palomo isn't always as assured in rendering the darker material.","Forgoing the scrappy charm of Psychic Chasms, Alan Palomo's sophomore album-- recorded mostly alone in Finland in the dead of winter-- chronicles the Texas-raised musician's solitary longing and heartsickness with a commitment to tighter, wide-reaching songcraft.

Psychic Welfare,Pink Skull,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fa13d197565213a55d/1:1/w_160/3c2c0037.jpg,2011-09-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15816-pink-skull-psychic-welfare/,Rvng Intl.,"There was a time, a couple of years ago, when Philadelphia's Pink Skull seemed to be developing their own hybrid of club-music precision and alt-rock sensibility, a sort of parallel to what the DFA bands were working up in New York. The duo of Julian Grefe and Justin Geller had finely honed senses of rhythm, tone, and humor from the get-go; they didn't resort to words very often, but when they did, they were pretty funny. (The previous two Pink Skull albums were called Endless Bummer and Zeppelin 3-- both classic-rock references, notably.) Grefe and Geller added a guitarist, bassist, and drummer to the group's lineup a few years back (whereupon they became a solid live band), and they've thrown in a few more band members for Psychic Welfare. Somehow, though, a lot of their virtues have fallen away. There's nothing here with a beat as crisp and vigorous as Zeppelin's ""Gonzo's Cointreau""-- another Zep joke!-- or Bummer's ""Ritualistic Bug Use"". Nothing here clocks in at more than four-and-a-half minutes; none of these grooves could sustain themselves for much longer. (Of the 13 tracks, four are esssentially single-idea interludes.) The most dubious change Pink Skull have undergone, though, is focusing much more on songs with vocals, which have never been their strong point. Grefe's not a particularly charismatic or compelling or assertive singer, and he doesn't have a lot to say lyrically, so his voice ends up being the least distinctive but most omnipresent tone on the album-- the equivalent of an overused keyboard preset from a band that would never otherwise dream of overusing a keyboard preset. ""Hot Bubblegum"" starts as a cute musical paraphrase of ABC's old synth-pop single ""Be Near Me"", but Grefe's tuneless, why-am-I-doing-this vocal performance (""Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ It's all over me"") keeps it from going anywhere. Pink Skull's gift for texture is inalienable: This isn't much of a dance record, but it's pretty neat as a headphone record. That's especially true of the one genuinely terrific song here, the dissonant instrumental stomp ""Bee Nose"", whose creepy, sidling synths come off like curdled Boards of Canada. Even the lesser tracks have cool little details in their arrangements, though, like the doubled bass lurch that drags ""Janine Aubergine"" across its foursquare snare-snap or the airy saxophone solo that pulls ""Mu"" together and explicitly recalls the way Ultramarine records toyed with prog-rock in the early 1990s. Still, this is a retreat from a group that was once much weirder and brasher. Where they used to feed both the hips and the head, this time they're settling for distracted pop songwriting and tone without groove. They're taking themselves more seriously than they ever have before, but what used to make them a pleasure to listen to was that they took nothing except their craft seriously.","On their third stuido album, Philadelphia's Pink Skull add more members and more songs with vocals, but skimp on the Led Zeppelin jokes.

A Winged Victory for the Sullen,A Winged Victory for the Sullen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f9b1335d7bf169a1df/1:1/w_160/a8fed289.jpg,2011-09-14 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15809-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen/,KrankyErased Tapes,"When I heard Adam Wiltzie, known for his ambient work with Stars of the Lid, and Dustin O'Halloran, a Berlin-based pianist/composer and member of the dream pop band Devics, were teaming up for a new project, I knew what to expect. Which isn't a bad thing. Wiltzie makes sonorous and droning music with static harmonies in Stars of the Lid (and has played in Windsor for the Derby); O'Halloran writes melancholy piano music built around the repetition of chords and phrases. A Winged Victory for the Sullen, it turns out, is an exact halfway point between the two. What's interesting about the sound they've hit on isn't so much what the two musicians bring to each other's styles, as it is what each sacrifices from his own. In Stars of the Lid, Wiltzie and Brian McBride have a particular way of massing instruments into a big, pulmonary drone-- the individual timbres of the instruments rarely rise out of the overall shape. You can hear him do some of this on A Winged Victory for the Sullen, making new sounds out of many sub-sounds, but he also lets certain individual tones take over. It creates small, noticeable details in otherwise large, fairly monolithic compositions. O'Halloran is a synesthete, and I wonder what this music looks like to him. Certainly, it has different colors from his own work, though his usual palette is present. He's used to the repetitive harmonic structures favored by Wiltzie, but in his own music there is typically more movement. When his music includes more than piano, he's usually chosen those instruments for their unique timbres. Here, he's giving a bit of that away to Wiltzie. The strings-- and even to some extent the piano-- move in and out of focus. The duo did some of the principle recording at Berlin's Grunewald Church and overdubbed some of the strings in East Germany's old state radio studios, so some of this blurring and refocusing can be attributed to acoustic spaces in which the recordings were made-- like Wiltzie's other duo, A Winged Victory creates all these otherworldly sounds using only traditional instruments. The band was named in reference to a Greek statue in the Louvre called ""Winged Victory of Samothrace,"" a long-beheaded depiction of Nike, the winged goddess of victory, found on the Greek island of Samothrace. It portrays the striding, triumphant figure, an image of arrested motion that ties nicely to this record: A Winged Victory's music, more active than drone and thicker than minimalism, captures movement and freezes it.","Stars of the Lid's Adam Wiltzie and pianist/composer Dustin O'Halloran find a halfway point between their projects, creating music that moves more than drone and feels thicker than minimalism.

Gravity the Seducer,Ladytron,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d6b1335d7bf169a1a8/1:1/w_160/74cd525c.jpg,2011-09-14 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15803-gravity-the-seducer/,Nettwerk,"Seduction can be an evil art, and Ladytron are certainly capable of resisting it. The Liverpool mainstay's fifth album is titled Gravity the Seducer, but Newton's discovery clearly struggles to seal the deal throughout. During their dozen-year career, the band's refused to outright repeat themselves-- 2002's Light & Magic was a glossier, more robust update on the toy-store analog work of the previous year's debut, 604, while 2008's underrated, overstuffed Velocifero added a menacing stare and at-times mismatched experimentation to the void-creating shoegaze synths of 2005's game-changing The Witching Hour. For Gravity the Seducer, they've taken off the cinder block that Velocifero applied to the gas pedal, opting for a floatier, airy feel that often sounds as if its creators' feet are barely touching the ground. Hired gun Alessandro Cortini (Nine Inch Nails) returns to lend an extra hand, but his touch is less heavily felt than on Velocifero, where, more often than not, throttling industrial rhythms prevailed. Change is good, right? Well, here's the rub: Ladytron aren't quite content to let go of the since-perfected Witching Hour sound that won them attention beyond the Cobrasnake crowd, so the push-and-pull between their new-look sound and the blank-eyed electrogaze of the past creates an unfortunate tension. ""Ace of Hz"" and ""Mirage"" are boilerplate, late-aughts Ladytron, right down to the charging synth melodies and vague political-naturalistic lyricism, and the former's shoulders-shrugged ordinariness is driven home when its melody is redone on the instrumental LP closer ""Aces High"". Earlier on the album, another sorta-instrumental rears its head in the form of ""Ritual"", a limp faux-rocker that, if nothing else, makes for an easy ""Roxy Elevator Music"" joke. Unsurprisingly, the weightless pomp of Gravity the Seducer's fresher material is more impressive. Opener ""White Elephant"" is a sneaky-good song with a swaying melody that belongs in the Great Ladytron Songs canon, while the drum machine-kissed ballad ""Ambulances"" bucks the band's trend for blush-worthy, Tolkien-esque lyricism in favor of a worrying plea in the name of lost love. Still, even when Ladytron attempt to fully escape the past, it haunts them: the melodic structure of album highlight ""90 Degrees"", in all its glistening beauty, can't help but recall Witching Hour closer ""All the Way..."", a song that's of the band's most directly affecting works to date and certainly more substantial than the majority of what's here. So Gravity the Seducer is a transitional album bearing the growing pains and separation anxiety that we usually associate with bands that are in between periods of true inspiration. It's not a bad record, but it is an upsettingly uneven one, especially considering the flashes of greatness that Ladytron are still capable of. I'm tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt, though, based on their longevity alone. In his review of last year's greatest hits collection, Best of 00-10, ex-Pitchfork editor Scott Plagenhoef made an excellent case for why Ladytron demand more than a light dismissal-- and, let's face it, considering the flash-in-the-pan electroclash ""movement"" that first gave them recognition, it's a pleasant shock that they've stuck around this long and still manage to evolve. ""Points for showing up"" usually carries negative connotations, so how about we give Ladytron ""points for surviving."" After all, simply sticking around without growing totally stale is a feat that's not easily pulled off these days.","For the Liverpool mainstays' fifth album, they've removed the cinder block that Velocifero applied to the gas pedal, opting for a floatier, airy feel that often sounds as if its creators' feet are barely touching the ground.

Verde Terrace,Curren$y,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f713d197565213a556/1:1/w_160/4765d04e.jpg,2011-09-14 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15820-curreny-verde-terrace/,Datpiff.com,"Years from now, we might look back and try to pinpoint exactly when Curren$y became one of the best rappers working, and wonder how we missed it at the time. Since his 2010 breakout Pilot Talk, the New Orleans rapper has reliably released a high-quality new mixtape or full-length album every couple of months, but he's remained perplexingly easy to overlook: as befits a rapper heavily indebted to weed culture, he seems less young-and-hungry and more like the guy who was always just around somehow. Committed, in a noncommittal sort of way. But don't let the hangdog pose fool you: it takes ferocious inner steel to put out this much consistently good music in so little time, and the fact that he's done so without disrupting the heavy-lidded calm of his pose only makes it more impressive. His latest release, the DJ Drama mixtape Verde Terrace, isn't his best work this year, or even in the last six months: that would be last June's Weekend at Burnie's. Like many recent DJ Drama mixtapes, it sags beneath some lazy or obvious beat selections. The boilerplate, rushed-feeling song titles reflect minutes of thought: ""My Life is a Movie"", ""Run Dat Shit"", ""High Tunes"". It contains the world's most unnecessary remake of Biggie's ""Ten Crack Commandments"", delivered entirely by Curren$y's Russian-doll miniature sidekick Young Roddy. And yet Curren$y has burnished his star to such a warm, hazy glow that whenever he appears on it, things snap immediately into focus. His weed talk has grown so metaphorically florid that it's entered its own realm: If you're a rapper who writes about getting high and you hear Curren$y say he gets ""lifted like sanctions,"" how do you even begin to respond? His puns and double entendres continue to boast sneaky layers, à la ""She puts the phone in her lap and when I call she comin'."" Verde Terrace boasts fewer of these quotables than recent performances, but he still proves he can spin your head with startling ease a dozen or more times. Indeed, what often gets shortchanged in Curren$y's ""weed rapper"" label is the compelling slipperiness of his mind: ""Nonchalant, but I'm very aware of what's going on,"" he assures us on ""Pinifarina"". His default mode is ""easily unimpressed,"" an attitude surely honed from doing time in shifting rap regimes from No Limit to Cash Money. ""I'm from New Orleans, I stunt/ In a blue moon once... But I don't be doin' too much,"" he raps on ""Ways to Kill Em"", a side-note observation that indicates the warily careful philosophy behind the bored facade: keep your head down, keep rapping. Verde Terrace doesn't break any new territory for Curren$y, but ""new territory"" isn't really part of his M.O.-- he is digging a groove, one into which he settles more comfortably each year. It's a technique he might have soaked up from his one-time mentor Lil Wayne, who chased the same six metaphors single-mindedly until they yielded delirium. Like Wayne, Curren$y is refining the contours of his tiny universe so that it resembles no one else's. The point is driven home on Verde Terrace's outro ""Smoke Sum n"", when Wayne appears for a guest verse. It's the first time the two have collaborated since parting ways four years ago, and the ships-passing-in-the-night moment is telling: Wayne very much sounds like a visitor in Curren$y's territory now. And Curren$y sounds like no one's idea of a sidekick.","What often gets shortchanged in Curren$y’s ""weed rapper"" label is the compelling slipperiness of his mind. This DJ Drama mixtape finds the MC, like onetime mentor Lil Wayne, continuing to refine the contours of his tiny universe so that it resembles no one else's.

Wild Flag,Wild Flag,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0dbc0084474cd0c1d0c/1:1/w_160/2dd942ff.jpg,2011-09-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15798-wild-flag/,Merge,"On Sleater-Kinney's 2005 single ""Entertain"", Carrie Brownstein summed up her dissatisfaction with pop-cultural stagnation and new-wave nostalgia by asking, ""Where's the black and blue?"" She repeats the question three times in succession, each one increasingly maniacal, as if to illustrate her own point: Art can evolve only when it pushes forward, provokes, and leaves bruises. Alas, in the five years since Sleater-Kinney fell silent, nostalgia has become such a pervasive condition in pop culture that entire books are now devoted to analyzing the phenomenon. But Brownstein has not relented in demanding her black-and-blue, whether using her NPR Monitor Mix blog to lament the preponderance of sensitive, soft-rockin' beardos in contemporary indie, or skewering hipster fauxhemia alongside SNL's Fred Armisen on the IFC comedy show Portlandia. So for a vocal cultural critic-- and shit-hot guitar player-- like Brownstein, the act of forming a new band isn't a simple matter of course; it's a declaration of war. But rather than point fingers from the sidelines, with Wild Flag she's leading by example. The name Wild Flag amounts to more than just a distant echo of similarly imposing Black and Pink varieties; it represents something to rally around, at a time when the internet has broken down traditional musical allegiances in favor of all-you-can-eat consumption. As per its members' pedigrees (Brownstein is joined by fellow S-K veteran Janet Weiss on drums, ex-Helium front-woman Mary Timony on second guitar, and Rebecca Cole of Elephant Six affiliates the Minders on organ), Wild Flag variously invoke first-wave punk, post-hardcore indie rock, 1960s girl-group pop, Nuggets-vintage garage, Stonesy FM-radio raunch, and even flashes of proggy psychedelia. But Wild Flag aren't so much trying to relive a particular era or movement as re-stoke the kind of passion, commitment, and fandom in listeners that allowed those movements to coalesce and flourish in the first place. Brownstein and Timony previously collaborated in late-1990s side project the Spells, but where their voices tended to blend together within that band's lo-tech indie-rock sound, here their personalities are much more pronounced and distinct. For much of Sleater-Kinney's existence, Brownstein played the more mild-mannered foil to lead shrieker Corin Tucker, before asserting herself more forcefully on 2002's One Beat and 2005's The Woods; on Wild Flag, she essentially picks up right where she left off on ""Entertain"", pushing her voice toward more brash, flamboyant extremes. Timony, meanwhile, sounds as if she's still immersed in the fantastical reveries of Helium's 1997 swan song The Magic City, her familiarly conversational tone having an infectiously calming effect on the band. But in their own peculiar ways, both singers strive to express their irrepressible awe for the power of music and the effect it has on them-- nearly every song here hinges on the connection between sound and movement, and the relationship between what happens between the ears and below the belt. Brownstein's ""Romance"" and ""Boom"" are impassioned testaments to rock'n'roll's sensuous allure, translating inner desire into public manifesto; Timony sings of music's essence in more mythic terms, equating it to a magical artifact (the psychedelic set piece ""Glass Tambourine"") or cult ritual (""Electric Band"", as in: ""Come on, join our…"") as if she were the friendly fairy godmother on some subversively trippy Saturday-morning kids' TV show. The considerable contrast between the two singers gives Wild Flag a somewhat predictable ebb and flow, with a song-by-song trade-off between Brownstein's rambunctious, locomotive rockers and Timony's more quirky, complex compositions. Credit Weiss and Cole for effectively mediating between these disparate sensibilities: Wild Flag never sound more together than when they're being led off the rails by Weiss' Keith Moon-worthy breakdowns and Cole's wandering ""Sister Ray""-style organ lines, as they push the wiry ""Short Version"" and charmingly cheeky ""Racehorse"" into joyous full-band jams and sing-along chants. For all the ideological intent fuelling the Wild Flag mission, the band rarely sacrifices the rock'n'roll fun-- they no doubt deliver that elusive black-and-blue, but it's a hit that feels like a kiss.","The Sleater-Kinney/Helium/Minders supergroup's self-titled debut invokes first-wave punk, post-hardcore indie rock, and other styles, but Wild Flag aren't so much trying to relive a particular era or movement as re-stoke the kind of passion, commitment, and fandom in listeners that allowed those movements to coalesce and flourish in the first place.

A Creature I Don't Know,Laura Marling,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e5b1335d7bf169a1be/1:1/w_160/bae77272.jpg,2011-09-13 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15808-a-creature-i-dont-know/,Ribbon Music,"Laura Marling's music feels timeless. I don't mean ""timeless"" in the sense that people refer to, say, Adele or Duffy as timeless, when really they're really just evoking a very specific time that happens to be distant. Marling evokes other artists, too, but they're spread out over the past five decades of pop and rock, from Joni Mitchell, Fairport Convention, and Leonard Cohen to Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey. Still, her songs feel divorced from time, lacking clues or signposts to indicate whether her stories and scenes might be set 500 years ago or yesterday. Marling's first two albums were noteworthy in large part for their precociousness. Her newest is A Creature I Don't Know, and it's her first that can't benefit from stunning you with its level of maturity. This is simply who Marling is right now-- an artist deeply invested in archetypes, one who doesn't muck about with the details of 21st-century life in her explorations of desire, loss, and understanding. Certainly it's a brave artistic approach, this notion of wrestling with only the most primal states of being and ignoring all the fleeting fads and noise that make up the rest of our world. At the same time, such a large part of songwriting is making human connections, and often with Marling it's not entirely clear whether these songs are springing forth from a 21-year-old Englishwoman or some deathless, wandering spirit. Her reliance on heavily symbolic language and lack of interest in putting more of her personality into her compositions creates frustrating paradoxes: Her music's intimate yet distant, earthy yet seemingly not of this earth. That said, the success of each song on A Creature I Don’t Know hinges on how well Marling inhabits the role she's given herself. Fortunately, while she may not be a particularly revealing performer, she's an extremely commanding one. Marling's tendency is to be stark and direct, and her presence carries equal weight whether she's accompanied by little more than piano or guitar (the unnervingly hushed, death-obsessed ""Night After Night"") or a churning instrumental malestrom (the Neil Young-worthy ""The Beast""). On ""The Muse"", ""Salinas"", and the Zeppelin III-goes-hoedown single ""Sophia"", Marling's scarily impressive self-possession actually spills over into a kind of wickedly controlling glee, as she adds domineering theatrical flourishes to certain words and phrases in a manner that comes reasonably close to matching Harvey during her mid-1990s reign. Marling may spend the majority of these songs and several others struggling to find wisdom and peace in the face of trials brought on by lust, money, and death, but she almost always sounds like she already has all the answers.","On her third album, the British singer-songwriter proves to be an artist deeply invested in archetypes, one who doesn't muck about with the details of 21st-century life in her explorations of desire, loss, and understanding.

Dreams Come True,CANT,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0da13d197565213a526/1:1/w_160/f614129b.jpg,2011-09-13 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15793-cant-dreams-come-true/,WarpTerrible,"While the rest of Grizzly Bear make the most of the downtime following 2009's excellent Veckatimest, Chris Taylor is doing the opposite: He started a label, produced records for Twin Shadow and Blood Orange, and has now recorded and self-produced Dreams Come True, his first solo venture under the CANT moniker. It's impossible to talk about Dreams without taking a close look at the production. Taylor's done well to craft a particular in-house Terrible Records vibe, and with its abundant stylish synths and zoned-out bass textures, Dreams feels like a compelling mission statement for that sound. It's a distillation of the dusky, 1980s-leaning atmosphere Taylor carefully molded around Twin Shadow's pop songs on last year's Forget. There are also elements of Grizzly Bear-- more the darkened alleys and left-turns that characterized 2006's Yellow House than the fine-tuned engine of Veckatimest. At this point, though, it feels a bit clinical. In some ways the sound's the logical opposite of the more lo-fi/bedroom projects of the past few years, but Dreams also suffers from similar problems in terms of depth and emotional connection. There's plenty of surface enjoyment on ""The Edge"" or ""BANG"", both showing an impressive attention to detail and easy-riding synths. The tracks' drawling slo-mo funk calls to mind some of Prince's more introverted moments, and Taylor's voice sounds great. But there's a nagging feeling that the aesthetic compositions, here and elsewhere on Dreams, are like bubbles-- they float by with solid-looking, effervescent charm, but burst upon closer inspection. The cold, surgical atmosphere comes off like something American Psycho's Patrick Bateman might enjoy in 2011: Some of Dreams isn't far from the expensive-sounding Genesis of Invisible Touch, particularly the sterile gloss of that record's ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"". While Taylor is no Phil Collins-- and he errs more on the side of emotional nonchalance than Collins' tendency to over-sing-- they both share an unwavering seriousness. Set against the dense backdrops of the title track and songs like ""Answer"", that seriousness makes everything feel a bit overburdened, lacking in the coy naivety or light touch that made the Twin Shadow record a fun and interesting listen. (Really, Dreams too often sounds like a retread of Forget with the fun sucked out.) The record is most gripping at its last breath: The end of ""Rises Silent"" and ""Bericht"" find Taylor alone with a piano, shorn of the stylistic trickery. The result is disarmingly tender, adding a few heartfelt minutes of warmth and personal connection, something lacking in the rest of Dreams' gloss.","Grizzly Bear member, Twin Shadow producer, and Terrible Records honcho Chris Taylor releases his first solo venture, a mission statement for his glossy, stylish in-house sound.

Eleven Fingers,Circle of Ouroborus,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e913d197565213a53e/1:1/w_160/36346e05.jpg,2011-09-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15815-eleven-fingers/,Handmade Birds,"Most of today's forward-thinking black metal groups weren't born that way. This includes better known crossovers like Chicago's Nachtmystium or Norway's Enslaved, bands who started by coloring within the lines but eventually shifted styles so radically, they basically invented their own genres. Usually in black metal-- a scene with an extremely rigid set of rules and regulations-- progression takes time (and balls). Now and then, though, a black metal group emerges fully weird. Some of these are eccentric oddities (see, for instance, Striborg); others have a larger universal vision in spite of their strangeness. One of the more compelling of the latter is Circle of Ouroborus, a Finnish duo that's been finding ways to straddle its love of Joy Division and corpse paint for a number of years. (If their intentions weren't explicit enough on a 2004 demo or an early, eerie split with Germany's Urfaust, their first full-length, 2006's Shores, included a cover of ""She's Lost Control"".) Since the beginning, CoO have continually tweaked and refined what they do, further establishing (and enmeshing themselves in) a very particular aesthetic, all without sounding samey. In 2010 they released, among other things, the Current 93-like Cast to the Pits, the droning, blackened Fall-esque depresso rock of Unituli, a split with the post-metal band Crooked Necks, and the Wold-scaped MatterEther EP. The fact that the group is just two guys-- multi-instrumentalist Atvar and vocalist/lyricist Antti Klemi-- gives them a kind of devil-may-care, ready-for-battle gameness. Or, to put in terms of prolific lo-fi peers from a different scene: Since 2004 they've put out records at a Guided by Voices pace. For instance, 2010 alone had close to 10 releases, including three full-lengths, a couple of EPs, a pair of demos, splits. Some are minor, some skippable, all of them pretty hard to track down. Their newest, Eleven Fingers, is my favorite CoO to date, their best full-length since 2009's Tree of Knowledge, a collection released by Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions. This new one, mastered by James Plotkin, is out on Handmade Birds, the new imprint by R. Loren (Pyramids, Sailors With Wax Wings). It should also be easier to find than some of the others: The initial vinyl edition of 500 will be followed by a larger CD edition Loren says will likely be available ""well into next year,"" something you don't usually hear regarding a CoO record. Beyond availability, it's the strongest, most concise example of what they do, a dark and depressive sort of blackened post-punk that also manages to be catchy and anthemic. (The lines, ""Now I drink the wine and swallow the shadow/ Now I take my knife and slash this landscape apart,"" on standout ""Shadows Lead"" should also give you an idea of the feel they're after.) Importantly, it's also a record that will appeal to people who don't care, at all, about black metal. As the previously posted ""Warpath"" suggested, Eleven Fingers spins a darkly cavernous, bizarrely buoyant sound that really is akin to Ian Curtis and mates delving into the kind of black metal that came along after Lords of Chaos. It's raw but deep, and there's a lot folded into its layers: Pair it with Iceage, and it's punk; play it with Amesoeurs, and the more post-metal tendencies surface. Even on the album's more stationary, droning rants, you get a sense of movement and release, something not always present in CoO's past material. They're better songwriters now, able to offer strong melodies and hooks, not just the originality of the aesthetic. In fact, the push and pull between these seven tracks feels impressively endless-- guitars buzz like synthesizers, drums pull you in with their wobbling rolls. More than on other recent offerings, they've found a way to re-introduce some of the black metal elements first associated with them: On opener ""The Prayer"", that deadened Curtis bellow is repeatedly interrupted by a full-on growl. Speaking of which, the most integral part of Eleven's upgrade are Klemi's vocals: The submerged, sadsack Mark E. Smith-patterned rantings are tuneful and (surprisingly) emotional. Overall, there's less distance. In the past you sometimes got the sense he was singing to himself in the next room; here, there's a weird connectivity, even if you have no idea what he's howling beneath all the fuzz. The biggest surprise, and greatest pleasure, though, is that Circle of Ouroborus no longer seem all that weird. Sure, one of the things that's always made CoO interesting is that dogged adherence to their original, obsessively personal aesthetic. (The ""Ouroboros"" is the symbol that shows a serpent forming a circle by swallowing its own tail. Or, as Klemi bellows in ""Warpath"": ""My pulse is my mantra."") But if you didn't know the history, and didn't follow the timeline, Eleven Fingers would hit you like a great, haunting, moving post-punk record, not the culmination of a march inward by a couple of Finnish outsiders.","For a few years now, this Finnish duo has been finding ways to merge its love of Joy Division and corpse paint into a dark and depressive sort of blackened post-punk, and this is arguably its strongest and most concise record.

Earth Division EP,Mogwai,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e79d034d5c69bf4947/1:1/w_160/5ff8e653.jpg,2011-09-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15810-earth-division/,Sub PopRock Action,"If that fire that hit the Sony/PIAS warehouse in London during the recent UK riots seemed abstract to you, consider this: Mogwai's Earth Division EP was one of the releases stacked in the warehouse when the fire hit. The whole stock of it was lost, and because they had to re-press it, they couldn't offer it for pre-order on their website. Multiply that across thousands of releases, and you have a pretty good idea of the effect that fire had on the industry-- it gave a lot of people who were already struggling to make money off music a hell of a hard time. All the more ironic, then, that Earth Division is among Mogwai's least fiery, least riotous recordings. The four songs, each averaging about four minutes long, mostly showcase the band's softest, most melancholy tendencies, tendencies that on the band's LPs are often set off by volume spikes, long crescendos, white noise, and the cumulative effects of repetition over long periods with subtle changes. Here, with one exception, they sound as though they're in soundtrack mode. The EP's bookend instrumentals especially have a cold and studied feel, mixing strings with piano and, on closer ""Does This Always Happen?"", a single repeated guitar phrase, to create static soundscapes. ""Get to France"" is gloomy and doomy, but feels almost like it would work best as an intro to something bigger. The middle of the EP is given to the extremes of the band's sound. ""Hound of Winter"" is the only vocal track, and like many of the band's vocal tracks, it's instrumentally rich but melodically flat. Acoustic guitars and harmonicas don't seem to suit them quite as well as electric guitars. The real keeper is ""Drunk and Crazy"", which draws on Mogwai's experimental strengths to create a miniature that feels far more drawn-out and epic than it actually is. It begins in a morass of lunging static and cuts suddenly to a middle passage of gorgeously arranged strings. The intro isn't some kind of fake-out-- the static returns later to swallow everything-- but the dynamic shifts, from shuddering noise to traditional beauty and back again, give the song a strong, compelling form. That kind of contrast, and mastery of it, has always been what defined Mogwai at their best, whether it was textural contrast or simple shifts in volume or rhythm. It's not present on the other three tracks here, though they are pleasant enough listening. At the risk of boxing the band in, though, ""pleasant"" has never been why I've come to Mogwai.","This soft, melancholic, four-song EP finds the Scottish post-rockers in soundtrack mode, and it ranks among Mogwai's least fiery, least riotous recordings.

Strange Mercy,St. Vincent,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e8b1335d7bf169a1c2/1:1/w_160/ff09b428.jpg,2011-09-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/,4AD,"Directed by French New Wave great Éric Rohmer, 1972's Chloe in the Afternoon tells of a man caught between fidelity and a stylish old friend named Chloe, who usually pops up at his office after lunch. But just when it looks like the two are going to consummate their affair, the husband is struck with a crisis of conscience and runs back home to his wife. The opening track on Annie Clark's third album as St. Vincent is also called ""Chloe in the Afternoon"", and while Clark has acknowledged the influence of Rohmer's film on the song, she takes the story to a darker, more dominatrix-y place. In her telling, Chloe carries a ""black lacquered horse-hair whip,"" and, presumably, is paid to use it on white-collar exhibitionists looking for a sadistic tea-time fix. Clark's monstrously corroded guitar riff stands in for the bruised skin and wincing faces; it's hard to tell if she's singing as the person wearing heels or the person being stepped on with them, and that's most definitely the point. Across three albums, the Dallas native has become a master of subverting her picture-perfectness with violence, rage, and mystery-- ""I'll make you sorry,"" sang Clark in creepy lullaby tones on the very first song on her debut album. The juxtaposition is naturally intriguing, a sophisticated twist on finding out that the horror-movie killer was actually the girl next door all along. ""Physically, I'm a very demure-looking person,"" Clark said in a recent Pitchfork interview, ""but I certainly have as much aggression or anger as the next person, and that's got to come out somehow."" On her fine, art-rocking debut, Marry Me, those feelings of hurt, loss, and bloodlust could translate a tad cutesy. (On new track ""Cheerleader"", the lines, ""I've played dumb when I knew better/ Tried too hard just to be clever,"" sound more self-consciously frank than usual.) Follow-up Actor found Clark over-embellishing at times, adding superfluous strings and flutes that often muddied her message. But Clark's recent live Big Black covers saw her taking the pretty/ugly contrast to raw new levels: ""I think I fucked your girlfriend once, maybe twice,"" she sang, fervently, on ""Bad Penny"", ""I fucked all your friends' girlfriends-- now they hate you!"" And anyone who's seen the Berklee dropout do her seizured duckwalk in concert while soloing on unhinged tracks like ""Your Lips Are Red"" knows her not-so-secret weapon is a lurching guitar style somewhere between Robert Fripp's sheet-metal prog and Tom Morello's 10-ton riffage. On Strange Mercy, she ditches Marry Me's naivety and Actor's ostentatious arrangements, boosts the inventive guitar playing, and ends up with her most potent and cathartic release yet. Some tracks build like a hot kettle, puffing out ragged smoke in the form of instrumental curlicues. ""Surgeon"" finds Clark zonked, despondent, paralyzed. ""Turn off the TV, wade in bed, a blue and a red, a little something to get along,"" she sings, ""best, finest surgeon, come cut me open."" And soon enough, the song revives itself with a bursting synth freak-out courtesy of gospel keyboardist Bobby Sparks. ""Cheerleader"" breaks on its enormous hook, with Clark singing, ""I, I, I, I, I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more,"" each ""I"" pounding down hard, emphatically stating its independence. And it's Clark's manic guitar-- sounding like exploding radio static-- that cuts through a relationship's indecisive fickleness on ""Northern Lights"". On that song, she sings, ""Gotta get young fast gotta get young quick/ Gotta make this last if it makes me sick,"" and the topic of aging and lost youth is brought up several times on the album. At 28, Clark seems to be sorting through her own existential artistic dilemmas. A champagne year is supposed to be celebrated when you turn the same age as the day you were born, but ""Champagne Year"" finds the singer-- born September 28, 1982-- in a decidedly non-bottle-popping mood. Her voice takes on a gorgeous creak on the nebulous ballad, as she sings, ""I make a living telling people what they wanna hear/ It's not a killing but it's enough to keep the cobwebs clear."" An almost-30 indie musician's lament? Perhaps. Meanwhile, the galloping ""Hysterical Strength"" employs some magical thinking while dealing with death. When Clark isn't bulldozing through time and space with her fretwork, she's contemplating her place with care. The balance is something to behold. While Strange Mercy's more propulsive workouts-- including the single ""Cruel"", Clark's purest pop song to date-- are quick to snag attention, the slow burners hit just as heavily. The playful ""Dilettante"" combines the mutant funk of David Bowie's ""Fashion"" with the understated genius of D'Angelo's Voodoo, and has Clark possibly propositioning a prophet: ""Oh, Elijah, don't make me wait/ What is so pressing that you can't undress me, anyway?"" Closer ""Year of the Tiger"" is a stark summation of end-times capitalism in a recession-stuck United States. Sounding like a Wall Street swindler, she slithers, ""Italian shoes like these rubes know the difference/ Suitcase of cash in the back of my stick-shift... Oh America, can I owe you one?"" And the delicate title track involves a child, a father stuck behind prison glass, and a breaking point in the form of a refrain: ""If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up, no I don't know what."" Her threat here is not a gimmick or a subversion; it's irrational, confused, and real. Specific names (Chloe, Elijah) and times (""Year of the Tiger"", ""Champagne Year"") give the sense that Strange Mercy exists in its own universe. As does its music, which skips through art-rock touchstones from Talking Heads to Kate Bush to Peter Gabriel without relinquishing a bit of its originality. After all, those artists were trying to create new sounds, an ever-more-difficult task in a culture steeped in its own detritus. Here, Clark's role-playing is grounded in emotions that are as cryptic as they are genuine and affecting. And when her voice can't bear it, her guitar does the screaming.","On Strange Mercy, Annie Clark ditches Marry Me's naivety and Actor's ostentatious arrangements, boosts the inventive guitar playing, and ends up with her most potent and cathartic release yet.

Mountaintops,Mates of State,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d89d034d5c69bf492e/1:1/w_160/048849aa.jpg,2011-09-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15787-mates-of-state-mountaintops/,Barsuk,"In the early 2000s, it was not terribly uncommon to meet a punk kid with a soft spot for the Mates of State. Though I'm sure the word ""joycore"" was often stammered in justification, it actually made a lot of sense: There was an unmistakable DIY spirit to the band's earliest material. Husband-and-wife duo Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner's voices joined in imperfect, occasionally overripe harmony, and their songs were patchwork pieces with seams proudly showing (""We attach parts together until they make a whole song,"" they once confessed)-- all of which added to their debut record's unique and infectious charm. Unlike much of the impersonal, digitized pop that was emanating from the radio waves or your little sister's primitive, brick-sized mp3 player at the time, My Solo Project was pop music that felt transparently and exhilaratingly human. A decade later, certain core facts remain: Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel are still happily married, they are still an organ-and-drums two-piece, and you'd still convulse in a fit of sugar shakes if you found a way to bite into one of their songs. But a funny thing happened somewhere between 2003's rollicking Team Boo and the AM-gold glimmer of 2006's Bring It Back: Gardner and Hammel became pretty great pop songwriters. Their harmonies got more technically sound, their songs moved more fluidly-- basically, the seams don't show anymore. Bring It Back proved that this wasn't necessarily a development for the worse. But the band's last effort, 2008's Re-Arrange Us, was a misstep, not just for the much-cited reason that Gardner traded in her electric organ for a bland-sounding piano, but because the record's overall energy was inert. And if the damn Mates of State can't muster the energy to sound enthusiastic about anything, heaven help the rest of us. Mountaintops brings on an immediate sigh of relief: Its opening minutes are not just a return to form, but one of the most zinging 1-2 punches in the band's catalogue to date. ""Palomino"" is celestial pop with a chorus as big as the sky, and the warped synth groove of ""Maracas"" is irresistibly catchy. Suffice to say that if you don't get ""Maracas"", you don't really get this band, because it manages to cram almost every single reason the Mates are such a perennially charming guilty pleasure into a single song: holler-along lyrics that don't make a lick of sense (""Wooo-oooh/ Syncopated breathing!""), posi-energy to burn, and even a totally gratuitous Queen Latifah reference for good measure (""I've got your back/ U-N-I-T-Y!""). But if you can see past its feel-good vibe, ""Maracas"" also hints at the record's overall thematic maturity. Some more core facts about the Mates of State: Gardner and Hammel quit their day jobs 10 years ago (teacher and a medical researcher, respectively), they have spent the past decade in the record-tour-record state of eternal return, and they have been raising two children all the while. Mountaintops is the first of their records to grapple with the everyday tribulations and banality of spending your entire adult life in a band-- with your Mate, nonetheless. ""Basement Money"" is a surprisingly honest exploration of something few indie bands are brave enough to sing about: the necessity of making money off your art. ""At Least I Have You"" pulls the veil back even further. It's a song not just about feeling disconnected from old friends and familiar places, but the realization that the music you've devoted your life to playing is the only thing that can bring you release. Much has been made of the Mates' cheerful music as a testament to how completely and adorably in love they are, but Mountaintops intrepidly explores themes of isolation, codependence, and the things lost from operating for years with-- to quote ""Basement Money""-- ""a doublemind."" The chords that play out final track ""Mistakes"" are bittersweet, and there's something unsettling about the lingering last words of its refrain: ""I need you/ But it's not normal if I refuse to be by myself."" Mountaintops is not without valleys: the breathy balladry of ""Unless I'm Led"" is a bit too maudlin even for the Mates, and the Motown-meets-glee-club sugar rush of ""Total Serendipity"" is divisive at best. But overall, Mountaintops finds the Mates taking the more nuanced emotional tenor of Re-Arrange Us and splaying it across the mural-sized pop canvases we've come to expect from them. Impervious to trends and refreshingly uncool, Mates of State have managed to progress and mature within the confines of their own self-made niche. All of which is pretty punk, when you get right down to it.","After the misstep of 2008's Re-Arrange Us, the husband-and-wife duo Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner return to form, while offering the first of their records to grapple with the everyday tribulations and banality of spending your entire adult life in a band.

Odyshape,The Raincoats,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e19d034d5c69bf493b/1:1/w_160/963abbe0.jpg,2011-09-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15802-odyshape/,We ThReeWe ThRee,"It's well documented that plenty of oddities were snapped up and issued by major labels during the grunge era, but the fact that DGC released four albums by post-punk artists the Raincoats (including re-releases of their first three records and the then-new Looking in the Shadows) remains a confounding footnote of that time. David Geffen clearly didn't swell his already sizable bank balance by reissuing the band's second album Odyshape, as it quickly became as hard to find as the original 1981 Rough Trade version. It must be frustrating for the group to have their music fading in and out of time like this-- the preceding The Raincoats and the following Moving have been treated in the same manner-- but it helped cultivate a mystique around Odyshape. That feeling is partially shaped by the distinctly un-rock approach, with the core trio of the band (Ana Da Silva, Gina Birch, and Vicky Aspinall) occasionally utilizing African instruments including a balophone and a kalimba to get the job done. A big part of Odyshape's charm is derived from its backwards construction, with the band leaning away from the spikiness that made The Raincoats such an inviting listen, and writing many of the songs without percussion. The tribal drumming of original member Palmolive was forcibly removed from the mix-- she quit the band by the time of this record, causing percussion to be added after the fact by a variety of guest players including Robert Wyatt and This Heat's Charles Hayward. Coloring in the songs in that manner might sound like the band were shoving a square peg in a round hole, but it undoubtedly contributed to the uniquely disorienting air that Odyshape thrives on. It's from a place where the Raincoats' best ideas stem-- throwing orthodoxy out of the window, playing on instruments with which they weren't familiar, assembling all the parts back to front because the standard way of doing things held little or no interest. As such, it fits into that basic post-punk tenet of rejecting everything that came before to test out new ways of doing things. This album has little in common with anything else around at the time, other than the feeling that you're hurtling relentlessly forward into a previously unmapped musical space. There may be a little Scritti-esque hue to the guitar scratch on the pushy ""Only Loves at Night"", but much of Odyshape is positioned in a peculiar place somewhere between the earth and the sky. Sometimes a discordant violin howl is pitted against dreamy vocal pining (""Dancing in My Head""), at others the relationship is reversed and the singing takes on an earthy tone while the instrumentation is positively otherworldly (""Shouting Out Loud""). Occasionally those two impulses are conjoined, such as on the title track, where Birch delves into body dysmorphia over stop-start rhythms that feel like two different songs colliding. That schizoid shift can partly be explained by all the instrument swapping going on in the band, but it's also an escape and an embrace of the circumstances in which the band found themselves. Holed up in a squat in London, which Birch admitted (in Simon Reynolds' Rip It Up and Start Again) had mushrooms growing out of the toilet wall, they found a release in Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis albums, and the transformative tones of the unconventional instruments that ended up being scattered all over this record. England wasn't a peaceful place during 1981; riots prevailed, the economy was in dire shape, and the rise of Thatcherism gained a stranglehold on the country. Fast-forward 30 years later and Odyshape is being released again, in much the same climate, acting like an acute reflection of all that hurt and the contrasting desire to block it out for a while. That divide between the oblique and the real is what separates Odyshape from the ideas the Raincoats' post-punk peers were pushing toward, many of whom went one way or the other but rarely met in the middle. It's a very intimate recording, full of sounds they wisely never tried to recreate again, and vocal takes that are often inflected with a heart-crushing vulnerability. There's no easy category for this record to slip into; sure, you can sometimes hear hints of reggae, and at times there's a folky tinge to a few of the songs. The latter is particularly unusual in the post-punk scene, but makes sense here when you consider how these tracks were initially conceived, and the fact that Robert Wyatt (also a keen jazz fan and with a distinctly English folk-iness all of his own) was drafted in as a collaborator. It's telling that Kim Gordon was brought in to provide sleeve notes but doesn't say a single word about the album, and no demos, outtakes, or other ephemera are included. Despite living in an era where almost all music is available on tap, Odyshape still feels like a self-contained secret floating out there waiting to be uncovered.","Despite living in an era when almost all music is available on tap, the Raincoats' 1981 post-punk classic still feels like a self-contained secret.

Tripper,Hella,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0de5e6ef95969322036/1:1/w_160/3d1f78fc.jpg,2011-09-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15806-hella-tripper/,Sargent House,"No matter how much Hella have juggled their lineup, the music has always sounded the same. The Sacramento-bred spazz-rock duo's done the OutKast split-solo album thing (Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard), given its songs the coffee-shop open-mike treatment (Acoustics), and revamped itself into a five-piece supergroup (There's No 666 In Outer Space). Yet through all of these rearrangements and reinventions, the band has rarely deviated from its staple schtick: shreddy guitars, frenetic drumming, and hooks scavenged from the Power Glove era of Nintendo gaming. Sometimes it was hard to tell if they were dedicated to a singular vision or stuck within one. Following a four-year hiatus, Tripper finds Hella back to their original two-piece incarnation, with founding members Spencer Seim and Zach Hill on guitar and drums. It's business as usual: spastic pounding, warp-speed scalar runs, and various math-rock feats of strength. Tripper is a more focused effort, but only in comparison to the wanton schizophrenia of other Hella records. On ""Long Hair"" Seim gets more melody out of fewer notes, sticking to single riffs for longer stretches of time. On ""Yubacore"" Hill plays with dynamics, interrupting his constant stream of abstract fills with a few simple, spacious grooves. Hella are never relaxed, but they no longer sound like they're sprinting to get to the end of the record. For all of the sweaty battering and calculated sloppiness, Hella's music always retained an inorganic feel. They make high volume but emotionally distant music. The band's main muse, in spirit if not in sound, is Devo. That hasn't changed on Tripper. Hella's peers-- art-school shredders like Mick Barr (Orthrelm, Krallice) and Lightning Bolt-- found their inspiration in hardcore punk and more extreme strains of metal. Though their playing is repetitive and mechanical, it's framed as a quasi-spiritual pursuit and, in Lighting Bolt's case, done in the hopes of producing a sweaty moshpit meltdown. Hella's intent is more arch. The song titles-- ""Kid Life Crisis"", ""Psycho Bro""-- are meaningless goofs. The music's unpredictable and schizophrenic architecture subverts earnest headbanging. On Tripper, Hella's instrumental chops are better than ever, but riffs aside, there's not much to think about.","After revamping into a five-piece supergroup for 2007's There's No 666 in Outer Space, Hella's back to their original two-piece incarnation and business as usual.

Freaking Out EP,Toro y Moi,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d79d034d5c69bf492a/1:1/w_160/5e23bb95.jpg,2011-09-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15785-freaking-out-ep/,Carpark,"Now that there's little choice but to treat chillwave as an actual genre, it's at risk of the same kind of restrictive codification that's strangled so many of its predecessors. The word has come to mean a specific style-- glowing electronic pop that calls to mind faded photographs. But what initially drew comparisons between such groups as Washed Out, Neon Indian, and Memory Tapes wasn't such an easily identifiable set of musical signifiers. As with most category names that stick, chillwave was a feeling. There's no better example of the genre's catholic origins than Toro Y Moi mastermind Chaz Bundick. Last year's Causers of This established Toro Y Moi as one of the mini-scene's leading figures, with the post-crash economic reality of lead single ""Blessa"" (""I found a job, I do it fine/ Not what I want, but still I try"") aligning the album with Neon Indian's ""Deadbeat Summer"" and Washed Out's High Times-- and Bundick's full-length debut had a warmly nostalgic electro-R&B aesthetic, to boot. But by then he had already released 2009's Body Angles tape, which, yeah, presaged Causers with synthy closer ""Timed Pleasure"", but mostly emphasized scuzzy guitars. And Bundick has said he actually recorded this year's garage-pop ""Leave Everywhere"" single in 2006. In the meantime, he's given us straight-up dance (his Les Sins project) and an album that expands on the atmospheric funk of Causers using a lusher, more organic instrumental palette (this year's Underneath the Pine). The definition of chillwave may have to expand yet again. Memory Tapes' solid if disappointing follow-up to 2009's zeitgeist-capturing Seek Magic had more in common than with the sound of this Internet-born subset, but Bundick, along with Neon Indian and Washed Out, continues to embody its spirit, which was always more body-oriented than detractors would care to admit. With the Freaking Out EP, Bundick moves from vaguely funky 1980s-tinged makeout jams to more explicitly funky 80s-tinged dancefloor jams-- think Chromeo. The change isn't as successful as his best work, but it still makes for a plenty rewarding between-albums EP. Advance mp3 ""Saturday Love""-- a cover of a 1985 Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production for R&B singers Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal-- is the highlight here, with its sweetly catchy days-of-the-week hook, tinkling two-finger piano, and thwacking neo-new jack swing drum programming. Yearning, bass-limber opener ""All Alone"" and finger-snapping dance finale ""I Can Get Love"" even share the strobe-like keyboards present on much of Causers-- the last song has that post-Dilla crackle, too. And ""Sweet"" applies the chopped up vocals and hazy incandescence of that album to further 80s-style R&B. ""Take it easy,"" Bundick soothes on the title track, another uptempo floor-filler. ""Don't worry anymore... Calm down."" I mean, how much more chillwave can you get, right?","After switching things up with this year's ambitious LP Underneath the Pine, Chaz Bundick  turns toward sweetly catchy and more explicitly funky 80s-tinged dancefloor jams.

"Father, Son, Holy Ghost",Girls,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e2c0084474cd0c1d18/1:1/w_160/8d7c821e.jpg,2011-09-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15811-father-son-holy-ghost/,True Panther,"We may eventually remember 2011 as the Year of Retro. Critic Simon Reynolds' recent book on the subject tapped into a feeling a lot of people had but couldn't quite pin down: In the age of the limitless archive, the relationship between new artists and their influences are changing. Since the retirement of LCD Soundsystem, San Francisco's Girls, who return here after the terrific debut LP Album and an also-great follow-up EP, just might be the band best making use of the current situation. Their music pilfers from the past without shame but also manages to sound like no one else. The first listen to Father, Son, Holy Ghost brings with it an almost eerie sense of familiarity, like these are songs you've been hearing your whole life even when you can't place them, and it's sometimes startling just how specific the references can be. The opening ""Honey Bunny"" has a shuffling beat and riff that is close to Paul Simon's ""Kodachrome""; ""Love Like a River"" has a verse structure, chord changes, and tinkling piano arrangement almost identical to the Beatles' ""Oh! Darlin"", which was itself a direct rip of songs like ""Blueberry Hill"". ""Magic"" has bouncy sunshine pop chords that bring to mind something from a Have a Nice Day comp, ""Die"" has almost the same melody as Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"". The arrangements throughout have whirring organ, guitar fills, solos, flutes, and backing vocals borrowed from classic rock and placed exactly where you would expect them to be. And tying it all together is the production from Doug Boehm and the band, which sounds ""old"" simply because it sounds so incredibly good. This is one of the best-sounding rock records in years, redolent of a time when there was more money to spend in getting the basic tracks perfect, better ears to figure out which microphone should be used and precisely where it should be placed, and no pressure to make the mix ultra-hot for digitally-driven radio. But if Father were merely an exceptionally recorded album built on obvious nods to the past, it wouldn't add up to much. Instead, the record comes alive with color and personality largely thanks to Girls' singer and songwriter Christopher Owens. He has a preternatural gift for turning clichés into into deeply affecting songs, and as they jump from one style to the next, from delicate acoustic balladry to noisy rave-ups, Owens' voice and point of view ground the record and make it distinctive. He is the center. As long as he is writing and singing, no matter what else is going on and being referenced, the music will be utterly his. A lot of that is up to the timbre of his voice. On Album, Owens often had the pinched, clogged-sinus tone of Elvis Costello without the sneer, but here his vocals are warmer and softer, often bringing to mind the whispery tone of Elliott Smith. It's a testament to the care of the recording that even when he seems to be cooing into the microphone while the sometimes-thick arrangements grow around him, every word is clear and in balance. His voice exhibits both weariness and innocence and manages to convey hope and despair in equal measure. It also has an androgynous quality that fits the themes of Girls' music. Owens' songs often seem to have an undefined and undirected desire for love and sex and friendship that exists outside of any one idea of sexuality. It's about feelings first, and the object of them second; who or what the singer wants is less important than the fact that the yearning is there, and it's unfulfilled, and that hurts. The lack of specificity can give Owens' songs a narcissistic slant, but it feels most like the self-obsession of early childhood, where lines between the self and the outside world aren't clear. ""I can see so much clearer when I just close my eyes,"" he sings at one point, and it feels like the work of someone who has done a lot of thinking in the dark. Indeed, so much about Owens' lyrical outlook, from how he uses shopworn imagery to the disarming simplicity of his declarations, conveys the sense of a child feeling around, discovering for the first time things we all found and absorbed years ago. So when he sings ""My love is like a river/ She just keeps on rolling on"" and ""Lay my burden down by the river's edge"" in ""Love Like a River"", it sounds like someone starting from the simplest conventions of the pop song and working inward to see if life actually functions the way that the songs tell us it does. Not since Jonathan Richman has there been a songwriter so willing to convey honest and deep feelings through the most basic pop syntax, and Owens also shares Richman's desire to use familiar song forms to get these essential messages across. On Album, it was easy to hear the words and focus on Owens' backstory, which included being raised in a cult whose belief system contributed to the premature death of his brother. But these songs feel too essential and relatable to connect it to Owens' life alone. It's more about what we make of it as listeners and less about the damage of his early years. There's also a layer of awareness in his delivery, and he's able to tweak his own naïvteté in interesting ways. On the opening song, ""Honey Bunny"", he sings about how his mother loved and accepted him and told him that ""everything will be all right"" and then follows by saying, ""I need a woman who loves me! me! me! me!"" This lyrical simplicity shouldn't obscure the fact that these are sharply constructed songs that take unusual turns. One of Girls' specialities is their willingness to go completely over the top but somehow keep us right there with them. Early single ""Vomit"" is one such epic, folding in soulful organ and the kind of wailing gospel-like vocals that signified ""authenticity"" when the Stones and Floyd ruled the world; but, with Owens' wounded voice in the middle of it all, even this bombastic song feels personal and even intimate. ""Just a Song"" begins with a gorgeously basic nylon string guitar figure and slowly drifts into a whispered refrain that stretches endlessly, Owens intoning, ""Love, it's just a song,"" in his softest way as flutes swirl around him. He seems to be slipping into a widening hole that's half oceanic bliss and half fade-out death, and that combination nods to Spiritualized, an influence that was there on Album and is sometimes present here, particularly in the way Girls don't shy away from repetition and mix sonic decadence with wide-eyed spiritual yearning. The largest canvas of all stretches across ""Forgiveness"", the eight-minute song that serves as the album's emotionally exhausting peak. It builds slowly and winds around in circles as Owens offers homilies about love and fear and redemption, and then it explodes into a melodic and moving guitar solo that releases the considerable tension. It's a big moment on an album that has so many they're almost hard to pick out, and it also happens to contain some of Owens' most straightforward writing: ""You'll have to forgive me brother/ You'll have to forgive me sister/ And I'll have to forgive you if we're ever going to move on/ No one's going to find any answers/ If you're looking in the dark/ And looking for a reason to give up."" He's right, but while there's nothing remotely new here, somehow the way Owens sings these words makes it feel like we're hearing them for the first time too.","Girls' second LP is an album rich with feeling and alive with color and personality. The first listen brings with it an almost eerie sense of familiarity, like these are songs you've been hearing your whole life even when you can't place them, all the while managing to sound like no one else.

Making Mirrors,Gotye,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0965e6ef95969321fc1/1:1/w_160/5dc54307.jpg,2011-09-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15749-making-mirrors/,Samples 'n' Seconds,"At his best, Gotye (stage name of Australian musician Walter De Backer) hearkens back to a time when the crop of middlebrow male pop stars wasn't so lousy with simpering troubadours or assembly-line idols. Instead, the ranks were populated by guys like Peter Gabriel, George Michael, and Hall & Oates, who sang forcefully and made bold pop hits with intelligent, grown-up themes. Artists who also had broad sonic appetites and arty predilections, guaranteeing their work would sometimes frustrate, but would remain intriguing. On his last solo album, 2006's Like Drawing Blood, Gotye achieved the abstraction and restlessness of good art-pop, but failed to bring enough actual pop to the equation. The album was an inspired, dense blend of globe-spanning sounds, yet it meandered far too frequently. Many of the songs stretched between five and seven minutes long, and found him stitching together multiple sounds and ideas at the detriment of shape or focus, eschewing pop's vital sense of urgency. Fortunately, with his newest release, Making Mirrors, Gotye has figured out how to remain sonically voracious while still giving his listeners a sturdy foothold. He finds room here for psych-rock, soul, earnest balladeering, creepy retro-futurism, electronic and Tropicalia touches, and, yes, scads of serious-minded 1980s pop. It's in that last category that most of album's best moments reside. Without ever settling in one spot too slavishly or lengthily to come off like a mere imitator, Gotye deploys his sincere, powerfully expressive voice (under-utilized on Like Drawing Blood) in evoking those bombastic 80s pop architects referenced above. ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"" dramatically convey the acrimony and finality of a shattered relationship, while ""In Your Light"" and ""Save Me"" offer up the redemptive side of the coin. These declamatory studio-pop moves don't just represent many of Making Mirrors' highlights; their shared style and tone also really helps hold the album together, compensating for Gotye's scattershot attention span elsewhere. Admittedly, some of these one-offs are very good – the Cee-Lo/Jamie Lidell-approved retro-soul of ""I Feel Better"" is the kind of thing that actually works far better as an isolated detour than an organizing principle. The same is true for the guileless ""Giving Me a Chance"" (which somehow manages to favorably evoke Travis) and the ""Drive My Car""-styled acid-rock blast ""Easy Way Out"". Only occasionally does Gotye wander too far off the reservation, but by that point he's earned his quirks, and so the bizarrely pitch-shifted, suburbia-tech nightmare ""State of the Art"" and eerily whispered, Reznor-ish ""Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You"" feel more like an endearingly loopy sidebars than self-indulgent, momentum-derailing bores. Gotye's exemplary pop sense may be the big revelation of Making Mirrors, yet it's his arty restlessness that will continue to keep him interesting.","Here Australia singer-songwriter Walter De Backer finds room for psych-rock, soul, earnest balladeering, creepy retro-futurism, electronic and Tropicalia touches, and scads of serious-minded 1980s-inspired art pop.

Whatever Brains,Whatever Brains,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cf13d197565213a518/1:1/w_160/4a243a8d.jpg,2011-09-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15789-whatever-brains-whatever-brains/,Sorry State,"Not to make like a late-night infomercial, but when you purchase the full-length debut from Raleigh, N.C.'s Whatever Brains on vinyl, you receive a download code that not only gives you all 17 album tracks in the popular mp3 format but also includes tracks from Whatever Brains' previous four singles. That's 12 extra songs! All at the same low price! There is one catch: The Whatever Brains that's on those singles isn't the band you'll find on their eponymous full-length. On the pre-album tracks, the band makes like they're randomly flipping through an indie-rock album guide, creating two-to-three-minute ruckuses that bring other groups to mind while never actually sounding like one particular precedent. Singer Rich Ivey, at times, evokes a very excitable (and young) Mac McCaughan, and there's a certain what-the-hell slapdash vibe that'll inspire folks to pair ""Pavement"" with the word ""slacker."" But pinning Whatever Brains down with a catch-all reference doesn't do them justice. And, anyway, that sort of stylistic hopscotch was merely a warm-up for the stunts they pull on their debut full-length. The group doesn't go off in an entirely different direction, or even take an odd detour; they simply use a much bigger map. It's a fitting move for a band that paid homage to an equally iconoclastic group, Minutemen, in the title of one of their early tracks, ""What Makes a Man Make 'What Makes a Man Start Fires?'"" The most noticeable, and potentially offputting addition to the arsenal is the synthesizer. It shows up on the album's first track, ""The Fisher"", and makes itself at home across most of the album. For folks hoping the group continued on their merry guitar/bass/drum way, this new member of the family might be unwelcome. But Whatever Brains prove to be adept at fitting it into their music, and tailoring their sound to make it work. Otherwise, the shaggy, lo-fi vibe of their singles is replaced with a sharper, more precise sound, turning fuzz-covered tunes like ""Blues Lawyer"" and ""The Future of Porn"" into do-it-kinda-clean tracks that'd be right at home on records by A-Frames or Cheveu. If there's any genuflecting being done in the name of Pavement, it's solely in the direction of Westing (By Musket or Sextant). By the sounds of ""Cousteau on a Crutch"", they might (as Pavement once did) also owe a tithing to Swell Maps. But then you listen to ""Bedsores"", and there's a chance Great Plains and Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments frontman Ron House is their personal Jesus. Whatever way the group prays, it's clear Whatever Brains practice the sort of all-inclusive musical polytheism that's all too rare in the world of indie rock.","Moving beyond their shaggy, lo-fi singles, the Minutemen-referencing, Pavement-nodding North Carolina band's eponymous full-length finds the band continuing to practice an all-inclusive musical channel-surfing.

WTC 9/11,Steve Reich and Kronos Quartet,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cb5e6ef9596932201a/1:1/w_160/53de8909.jpg,2011-09-09 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15796-steve-reich-and-kronos-quartet-wtc-911/,Nonesuch,"The first performance of WTC 9/11, Steve Reich's memorial to September 11, took place at Duke University-- 500 miles south of Ground Zero. From there, it traveled to L.A.-- nearly 3,000 miles west of the attacks it commemorated-- before touching down in Carnegie Hall a month later. It was an oddly circuitous cross-country tiptoe for a work by a native New Yorker about the collapse of the towers he lived four blocks from, but it spoke to the fearsome difficulty in addressing 9/11 headlong. There is still, 10 years later, an instinctive flinch mechanism built into our communal central nervous system surrounding the day, and it presents a forbidding hurdle for artists attempting to speak to it. Reich, as unofficial American composer laureate and a quintessentially New York City figure, would seem more outwardly qualified than most, which only makes his failure all the more disheartening. WTC 9/11 takes the same form as Reich's Different Trains, another piece that treated an atrocity-- in that instance, the trains transporting Jews to concentration camps-- with a sorrowful Zen gaze. Like Trains, WTC pairs the Kronos Quartet with manipulated recorded voices, the strings accompanying the recordings to draw out the anxious unheard music in their intonation and rhythm. It's a spectacular compositional technique, bridging the invisible gap where words become music. Within minutes, however, WTC 9/11 rams up against an unavoidable problem: These raw materials are, well, simply too raw. The voices Reich highlights in his music are a mix emergency dispatches from 9/11 and interviews conducted in 2010 with his close friends. Much of what they say is nearly unbearable to hear, even a decade on. If there is a way to subsume a 9/11 survivor saying, ""Three thousand people were murdered. What's gonna happen here next?"" into a larger musical work, Reich didn't find it. The words burn through the music's fabric like tissue paper, leaving you jarred but neither enlightened nor transformed. The smaller moments in the piece, painting the texture of daily life on the morning of the attacks, ring true with tension and foreboding. The conversational, lilting swing of ""I was sitting in class. Four blocks north of Ground Zero"", for instance. A sobbing cello catches the falling note of plaint in the phrase ""Nobody knew what to do."" At the intonation of ""We all thought it was an accident"" (spoken by Reich’s friend and colleague, Bang on a Can co-founder David Lang), the strings allow a brief glint of a major key to peak in, a moment of fugitive hope. Unfortunately, the moments that freeze you in place -- lines like ""debris engulfed everybody that was there,"" or a desperate shout of ""I'm trapped in the rubble""-- owe nothing at all to Reich's music; indeed, they all but erase your awareness of the music around them. The Nonesuch recording of WTC 9/11 is rounded out by other recent-vintage Reich pieces, and to spend time in their company after the heightened, jagged WTC is a relief. His 2009 Mallet Quartet is a delicate and ringing interlocking of marimbas that feels as cleansing as spring rain, while Dance Patterns, for a battery of vibraphones, xylophones, and pianos, plays like a glistening, fond medley of Reichisms. The framework of Reich's pieces feels well-worn by now-- his ""fast-slow-fast"" structure now has a ""loud-quiet-loud,"" ""verse-chorus-verse"" inevitability to it. The shifts in key midway through movements feel less like the blooming of an unexpected thought now than slides in a ViewMaster clicking duly into place. You smile and nod knowingly, but the goosebumps are gone. These low-key joys are reminiscent of latter-day Neil Young or Sonic Youth albums-- a master operating comfortably within his groove. They are modest, but they feel honest in their serene confidence. WTC 9/11, on the other hand, feels marred by miscalculation and overcompensation. This uneasiness found public expression when Nonesuch revealed the album's original cover art: a photo of the smoldering Towers, with the second plane zeroing in. The stark image was surrounded by a woefully cheap-looking graphical treatment, and prompted an immediate outcry. Nonesuch swiftly replaced the image, but the episode made its impression. Unfortunately, it could stand in as a diagnosis for the piece itself, a project conceived in noble intentions but hobbled by confused, muddled execution.","Steve Reich's memorial to September 11, which takes a form similar to 1989's Different Trains, another project he committed to tape with Kronos Quartet, mixes music with emergency dispatches from 9/11 and interviews conducted in 2010 with his close friends.

Who's Afraid of the Art of Noise [Deluxe Edition],Art of Noise,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ce13d197565213a515/1:1/w_160/7bea76cb.jpeg,2011-09-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15800-whos-afraid-of-the-art-of-noise-deluxe-edition/,SalvoZZT,"The introductory video on the DVD half of this reissue talks about the legacy of the Art of Noise-- mentioning Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers, and Massive Attack. It's easy to see why the group would be proud of such lustrous descendants, but it actually sells them short. What's interesting about Art of Noise-- certainly the first phase of their project, which culminated in this debut album-- isn't so much their children but their parents. This was a pop band named after a 1913 art manifesto, deliberately aspiring to inherit the explosion of early 20th century conceptual creativity and make Futurists and Dadaists rub shoulders with b-boys and clubbers. The group's own arch-conceptualist, music writer Paul Morley, apparently planned an album that would be a grand collage of the century's sounds-- what he actually got was an acrimonious split. Morley may, in his words, have only ""made the tea"" in Art of Noise, but he dominates the visual half of this reissue: introducing videos, reading out essays onstage, continually playing the ideas man and provocateur even if his incessant wordplay's an acquired taste. The group's videos are proof that this apparent pretension came with a smart payoff. ""Beat Box"" is recast as the soundtrack to a city with lively, evocative footage of 1980s London cut to its rhythm. ""Moments in Love"" mixes dancers and tortoises, grace and absurdity. And most famously ""Close (to the Edit)"", the dream-logic realization of the group's ideals, with a creepy punker kid commanding anonymous wreckers as they smash cellos and pianos to pieces. ""Close (to the Edit)"" reminds you that Art of Noise were trying to be funny and sometimes scary-- neither of them standard pop ambitions in 1984 or now. In fact, what's striking about this album is the range of moods and effects it musters, while remaining an intensely playful record. It follows the savage, martial arrangement of Cold War bricolage ""A Time for Fear (Who's Afraid)"" with a teasing version of ""Beat Box"" where the track's purposeful electro keeps getting diverted by shiny new sounds. On the title track, a snooty voice asks, ""Can I say something?"" and the music refuses to let it even say that, gleefully slashing the sample to ribbons. The album flirts with annoyance and even boredom-- the way the stately, repetitive beauty of ""Moments in Love"" lulls you before unwinding itself into stranger places. But they could also be thrilling. Their immediate context was hip-hop, but their kind of funk-- best experienced on ""Close (to the Edit)""-- has a brash rigor to it, calling to mind tireless pistons and marching feet. ""This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken,"" Luigi Russolo wrote in the manifesto that inspired the band, ""and the infinite variety of noise-sound conquered."" But the technological limits to sampling in 1984 meant that Art of Noise were stuck with a very finite variety of noise-sound, constantly worrying at and reusing snippets of samples. The only problem with the many reissues of early Art of Noise is the group's endless recycling of its two key tracks. ""Beat Box""-- of which ""Close (to the Edit)"" is a cousin-- and ""Moments in Love"" were on their first EP, then issued as separate singles, appeared on every compilation, dominated this debut album, and now appear-- counting the DVD-- six times each on this reissue. For diehard fans, the incessant tinkering is part of the fun-- for listeners less caught up in the band's process, it's easy to get a little weary with the radio sessions and alternate video edits collected here. Stick with the core album and videos, though, and you realize the reason Art of Noise kept returning to these songs: Both are superb, anchoring a record that's as sly, stirring, and occasionally infuriating now as it was on release.","Paired with original and alternate videos and BBC radio sessions, the London avant-garde pop conceptualists' 1984 debut is as sly, stirring, and occasionally infuriating now as it was on release.

Re: ECM,Ricardo Villalobos and Max Loderbauer,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d2b1335d7bf169a1a2/1:1/w_160/d5d5c774.jpg,2011-09-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15797-re-ecm/,ECM,"Ricardo Villalobos is the undisputed winner of the last decade's minimal techno movement. He released two of the period's finest long players (Alcachofa and the still underrated Thè au Harem d'Archiméde) but also established himself as an in-demand festival-packing DJ. Unlike his incredible run between 2004 and 2006 (when Ricardomania was so obvious that Philip Sherburne made note of it, mid-review), his releases these days are thin on the ground, limited to a single here, a remix there. His work has grown more historical as it's grown scarcer. It's not his own history he's concerned with, but the varying strands of musical DNA comprising his ropey, winking techno. ""Enfants (Chants)"" featured communal chanting, while this year's excellent Joli Chat EP was conversational and punchdrunk. His last ""album"" was a pre-mixed LP of his own productions. He's collaborating more. It's as if, having found his perfect beat, he's seeking its perfect context. Re: ECM sees Villalobos reach out to longtime experimentalist Max Loderbauer (who has a host of credits to his name; recently and notably he has played in the Moritz Von Oswald Trio). At issue is the varied output of fabled Munich jazz/out music label ECM (Edition of Contemporary Music). The two artists were given full access to ECM's vast catalog, and label founder Manfred Eicher oversaw the mastering process. The ""Re:"" (""regarding"") in the work's title is important: These are not remixes but rather compositions that suggest and converse with ECM's history. Villalobos and Loderbauer make no attempt to tie the works to beat-driven techno. The catalog is a quarry of sounds from which the duo extract loops and beats that range from ornament to animal. It's not necessary to be intimately familiar with ECM's catalog to enjoy Re: ECM (your reviewer is not); suffice to say that the label has housed most permutations of jazz and improvisational music since its inception in the late 1960s. Jazz and electronic music make natural partners; it's a pairing that many have explored previously, from Moodymann's dusty Black Mahogani releases to Four Tet's work with drummer Steve Reid. Both styles fascinate themselves with sustained textures and place a premium on sublimating the artist to the form (both also lack rock music's obscene physicality, which has allowed jazz musicians and electronic producers to stay creative late into their careers). Villalobos and Loderbauer don't seem interested in jazz's harmonic infrastructure so much as the vast array of tones used to produce it. Hissing hi-hats, voluminous stand-up bass, and damp woodwinds are placed decoratively next to one another. If I'm feeling cynical I start to think of Re: ECM as aural feng shui, its 2xCD, two-hour structure better suited for inattentive mood-setting than true exploration. But there's nothing easy or simple here; the artists' restraint provides plenty of airy space, but between that air are sounds that are almost uniformly rich and complex. It feels minimal but unbalanced. If Re: ECM were to soundtrack a dinner party, it would have to be of the newfangled, slightly sadistic variety in which the chefs have lots of tattoos and serve mostly foie gras and bone marrow. Re: ECM stands out not just for its depth but for its variety, for the sheer number of musics it incorporates. Jazz is the primary focus-- it has been for the label-- but the duo also touches on tribal blues (""Reannounce""), choral (""Rekondakion""), Eastern drone (""Requote""), and lounge (""Recat""). If Villalobos has ported over one element from his techno work, it's an uncanny ability to fashion rhythms that are both crisp and deep; the sounds here will buzz and twitch with his unmistakable style, but they'll do so less predictably. Applaud ECM for letting Villalobos and Loderbauer run amok; this album is a symptom of a process that has allowed ECM to remain relevant since its inception. For Villalobos, it's another tie, however oblique, to the musics that birthed his style. As a new generation of electronic producers-- notably Nicolas Jaar-- takes cues from his seminal works, Villalobos continues to reach backward. If he makes the past seem half as thrilling and rewarding as he once made the future seem, the next generation won't be the only one that owes him a debt.","Techno producer Ricardo Villalobos and longtime experimentalist Max Loderbauer were given full access to Munich jazz/out label ECM's vast catalog. The resulting two-disc, two-hour offering is not a remix collection, but rather a rich, complex suite of compositions that converse with ECM's history.

La Liberación,CSS,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c9b1335d7bf169a198/1:1/w_160/93b57f32.jpeg,2011-09-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15794-la-liberacion/,V2,"The 2006 arrival of Sao Paulo novo-wave sextet CSS couldn't have been better timed, coming as it did in the wake of a pervasive post-punk revival in indie-rock, a burgeoning Diplo-led interest in gritty Brazilian dance music, and a broadband-enabled globalized mode of music consumption that allowed record labels to perform international A&R scouting from their desktops. And CSS were more than happy to seize the moment, making music with no regard for tomorrow, filling their hipster-embraced debut album Cansei de Ser Sexy with trashy tributes to indie-rock favorites of the day and 15-minute celebrities du jour. However, after their 2008 downer of a sophomore album, Donkey, failed to generate the same amount of dancefloor traction-- and following a subsequent split from their North American boosters at Sub Pop-- CSS know it's going to take a lot more than a Death From Above 1979 reunion tour to make them relevant again. And so on La Liberación, they attempt something of a maturation process. If, as Pitchfork's Eric Harvey said in his review of Donkey, CSS' disco-punk found its life source in Blondie's ""Atomic"", then La Liberación finds them uncoiling that tightly wound sound to absorb ""The Tide Is High"" island vibes and ""Rapture""-style inner-city funk. Musically speaking, CSS can evolve only as much as lightning-rod frontwoman Lovefoxxx allows, and on La Liberación, she's only game to break from her potty-mouthed party-girl persona about half the time. That Lovefoxxx is aware of her own vacuity doesn't make it easier to take-- the remedial, call-and-response chorus of ""I Love You"" (all together now: ""I love you/ I love you, too"") may very well be a comment on the transactional nature of relationships, but, in the absence of a proper hook, it feels more like lazy songwriting. And the would-be empowerment anthem ""City Grrrl""-- an unapologetic celebration of revealing outfits and one-night stands-- feels like a forced attempt to fly the freak flag for club kids sick of dancing to ""Born This Way"". And yet as much as these songs play right into well-worn CSS themes of vanity and self-gratification, on La Liberación, the band sounds genuinely torn between pandering to the sort of hopped-up hedonists who want to rip off Lovefoxxx’s clothes when she does a stage dive, and a desire to dial down the crassness and redefine their character. Their experiments don't always yield useful results-- the downcast, acoustic-guitar-powered ""Partners in Crime"" comes awkwardly decorated with free-form piano rolls that trip up rather than propel the song's momentum. But there are moments when CSS find a way to successfully evolve without alienating their base, particularly on the playful, Afro-funk-inflected pop of ""Echo of Love"" and the ""Paper Planes""-fashioned, tropical slow-burner ""Hits Me Like a Rock"", a winning duet with Bobby Gillespie (returning the favor after Lovefoxxx's guest appearance on Primal Scream's 2008 release Beautiful Future). In light of these developments, the sax-squawked nihilism of the closing ""Fuck Everything"" feels all the more empty: There's enough evidence on La Liberación to suggest CSS actually do care about being a band you'll still respect in the morning.","After a downer of a sophomore album, the Brazilian group's third record finds the band torn between pandering to the hopped-up hedonists who want to rip off Lovefoxxx’s clothes when she does a stage dive and a desire to dial down the crassness and redefine their character.

808s & Dark Grapes II,Main Attrakionz,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c29d034d5c69bf4906/1:1/w_160/2c45a9b0.jpeg,2011-09-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15784-main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii/,,"The Oakland, California DIY hip-hop duo Main Attrakionz couldn't have come at a better time. It's no news that the indie rap spectrum is beginning to widen and mutate, allowing the agit-prop of Odd Future to beam into the eyeballs of 12.4 million viewers on VMA night, wiggling polarizing avant-weirdos like Danny Brown and (more notably) Lil B into the mainstream consciousness, ramping up demand for astrally fogged bedroom producer Clams Casino's beats and grabbing up page space for up-and-coming outsiders like Harlem's ASAP Rocky. It's no surprise then that Main Attrakionz are being lumped into the same discussions (after all, they've worked with the latter three aforementioned artists), and in turn are well on their way to gaining the similar levels of notoriety. At the end of last month-- hot off their new mixtape 808s & Dark Grapes II-- the pair headed East and rocked Manhattan's New Museum as part of its ""Get Weird"" series, a notable but fittingly offbeat inauguration. ""Weird,"" however, seems a tad ill-fitting when describing Main Attrakionz's music: While unconventional in the sense that if you stripped away those titular 808s, you'd be left with glassy synths and watery textures that one could easily classify as ambient, rappers Squadda B and MondreM.A.N. seem simply to be products of their environment. And we're not necessarily talking about Oakland. While as prolific, as unafraid to integrate leftfield influences into their music, and as happy to keep things subwoofer-friendly as their Bay Area peers, most of their success and musical inspirations call cyberspace home. And in the case of 808s-- the fourth freebie mixtape full-length that these barely 20-year-olds have released in the past year (not including their solo efforts)-- Main Attrakionz seem to be neither the rule nor the exception, but rather a well-meaning, well-balanced rap act that has a sound that's both very ""now"" yet convincingly true-to-self. As rappers, Squadda and Mondre at first seem unremarkable. Thematically, it's weed, women, and ambition, mixed with some mild introspection and broad sloganeering (""Ain't shit gon' change, but yo' ass can,"" goes the hook on ""Nothin' Gonna Change""). So while some might write the two off in the rhyme department, it's important to note that the rhymes aren't really the draw here. Instead, the simplistic approach reads like a mantra of self-disciplining restraint (or as Mondre explains on ""Paperwork"", ""I keep the music simple so any nigga can see""). Though lacking Lil B's bizarro free-associative style, it becomes pretty clear that, if their work ethic and output wasn't evidence enough, these guys are just constantly rapping: You can almost imagine them rhyming their way out of a speeding ticket or through a city council meeting (see: ""Rap Junkies""). Which is to say, it blends perfectly with the zoned-out production. And the fact that Squadda and Mondre aren't exactly foils-- I wouldn't have noticed that each rapper takes a solo cut here had I not had the tracklist glowing back at me-- everything on 808s seems to emulsify almost effortlessly. As the title suggests, this is music that will have you scrolling through your contacts to see if anyone's holding. Tracks like the new age-y ""Perfect Skies"" and the excellent ""Chuch"" spread out with a Zen-like grace that, coupled with Squadda and Mondre's fluid back-and-forth, invites you to melt into it. So, no, Main Attrakionz won't be spared the ridicule of jockeying the hipster zeitgeist-- after all, opener ""Bossalinis & Fooliyones Pt. 2"" samples Glasser's ""Treasury of We""-- but these idiosyncratic pairings offer insight into where these guys are coming from. Main Attrakionz have often been described as ""lo-fi rap,"" and while 808s & Dark Grapes II itself is sonically tight and clean, it reeks of homemade qualities. Just because you can't hear the vocals reverberating off the tacky wood paneling in some basement doesn't mean you don't get a feel for how it was made. These guys are very much of the digital age and clearly feel most comfortable between the hinges of their laptops-- never mind that when the two are backed by more traditional, blocky programmings, they come off as average at best. Thanks to having such a wealth of music at their fingertips, Main Attrakionz synthesize their influences and source material uniquely and offer an endearing voice where others simply troll. Or, to paraphrase another popular internet parlance: They're doing it right.","The young Oakland, California, DIY lo-fi rap duo couldn't have come along at a better time, but their fourth freebie mixtape released in the past year offers an endearing voice where others simply troll.

Red Sugar,Winter Family,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ca9d034d5c69bf4916/1:1/w_160/6b6246a1.jpg,2011-09-08 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15795-red-sugar/,Sub Rosa,"Winter Family are a duo, and their music is as black as the cover of their self-titled 2007 debut. Even when they use humor and irony, the material shades dark. Winter Family had a track called ""Auschwitz"" that found singer Ruth Rosenthal describing, in a sing-song little-girl's voice, a magical snowglobe containing a tiny replica of the concentration camp, complete with starving prisoners and an iron gate saying that work is the key to liberation. The duo's songs typically combine her exceedingly strong, deep, yet wounded voice with Xavier Klaine's keyboards, which veer from the heavy drone of the harmonium to impossibly delicate piano chords. She is originally from Israel, and Klaine is from Paris, though both are now based in Brooklyn; she sometimes sings but often speaks her lyrics, mostly in English but sometimes in Hebrew or French. Given the presence of her rich and heavily accented vocals and the harmonium, one obvious reference point is Nico, particularly the style of gothic cabaret she perfected on The Marble Index. Winter Family's songs are are ""heavy"" in every sense of the word, to the point where they sometimes threaten to become claustrophobic. And their second full-length, Red Sugar, is, if anything, even more bleak than its predecessor. But they also have a way of leavening the nightmare with glimmers of beauty, just enough to keep the music from getting too oppressive. The songs on Red Sugar tend to alternate moments of everyday life-- lovers falling into open arms, the sound of families getting drunk, birds shaking the water off their bodies, cats asleep in arms-- with impressionistic images of war and pain. You get the feeling of small lives being lived as a larger world of misery rages outside. ""Dancing in the Sun"", a nearly 14-minute track that serves as this album's centerpiece, shows  their skillful use of contrast. The first half is a tense and jittery mix of minimalist piano, crashing cymbals, and assorted creaks and groans, a grisly sound above which Rosenthal muses on industrialism, global warming, and fear of the future. But halfway through, the track fades into a long stretch of silence and then explodes into a field recording of a demonstration: It's a rally in Jerusalem featuring John Hagee and his group Christians United for Israel, and they're praising the country because of the role it will play in end-times Biblical prophesy. The juxtaposition of the menacing music with the at-first cheerful but eventually more frightening sounds of the mob is striking, and the words hint at the group's focus on the politics, religion, power struggles, and prejudice that bring people into conflict. The prickly burst of crowd noise in ""Dancing in the Sun"" exemplifies another terrific thing about this project: Winter Family's willingness to make unusual choices. ""Omaha"" is a creaking, harmonium-driven ballad whose lyrics (""Why did you go, my boy, to fight in a war that is not yours?"") seem to describe the Normandy landings in WWII. But then Rosenthal punctuates her spoken words with the mouthed sound of mortar shells exploding-- ""Ka-bough! Ka-bough!"" It's the kind of thing that looks questionable on paper and that most would have been embarrassed to try in the studio, but it winds up working brilliantly, evoking a child storyteller's description of a horror. Another surprising turn comes during ""Shooting Stars"", an achingly slow, mournful, and ultimately gorgeous piano ballad, when Rosenthal moans and wails wordlessly at the end of every stanza, her vocalizations expressing what her words cannot. As moving as I find this record, it's not an easy sell. It's such a weighty thing, exerting a constant pressure that is only occasionally relieved. But as harsh and despairing as Red Sugar can be, there's also a yearning for warmth and humanity, a desire to be lifted into the light. The key to it all is in how completely Rosenthal and Klaine inhabit this music: We never wonder for a second if they are really feeling it, and that makes it easier for us to feel. So if you have the time and inclination to give yourself over to Red Sugar, you'll find a fully formed and coherent world that's rich with emotion and dense with meaning, and the closer you lean into it, the more it opens up.","With a style that sometimes recalls the gothic drone of Nico's The Marble Index, the Brooklyn-based French/Israeli duo's second album-- focused on the politics, religion, power struggles, and prejudice that bring people into conflict-- is ""heavy"" in every sense of the word, but they have a way of leavening the nightmare with glimmers of beauty.

Atma,YOB,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07a9d034d5c69bf48a2/1:1/w_160/712add52.jpg,2011-09-08 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15724-atma/,Profound Lore,"If you spend some time digging through interviews and profiles of YOB, you'll find the consensus on the long-running heavy-as-full-stacks army of Oregon's Mike Scheidt is that his band fits partially into nearly half a dozen interconnected subgenres: psychedelic rock, stoner rock, stoner metal, blues metal, and, most consistently, doom metal. From associated instruments to target demographics, several factors unite those niches, not least of which is the propensity to indulge a sound, solo, or song for minutes on end. As it is with High on Fire, so it is with Hawkwind, and as it is with Earth, so it is with Eyehategod: When a band latches onto something it loves, be prepared to go the distance. YOB, it seems, is no different: ""The Great Cessation"", the title track of the trio's previous album, was a colossal 21-minute closer that took its time snaking through several obsessions, from the twinkling introduction and a throbbing mid-tempo midsection to a monolithic coda that felt like a great, malevolent sigh. Similarly, ""Adrift in the Ocean"" ends the band's latest LP Atma with a magnificent 16-minute rise: Middle Eastern-influenced guitars tessellate over teased cymbals until the full trio of Scheidt, drummer Travis Foster, and bassist Aaron Reiseberg lurches forward, rising and collapsing in thick, deliberate bursts for about eight minutes. Like its predecessor, Atma closes in a glorious burnout, Scheidt's post-rock-sized guitar solo ultimately smearing into a drone over a mangled drum limp. One of YOB's chief accomplishments here and throughout much of its discography has been its sterling ability to maintain a sense of momentum, whether the track ends after five minutes or pushes into the teens. The shortest of Atma's five tunes, ""Upon the Sight of the Other Shore"", nears the eight-minute mark thanks to several Geezer Butler-gone-Godflesh verses and a handful of guitar solos. Its sense of constant movement, though, isn't unlike that of the preceding ""Before We Dreamed of Two"", the album's 16-minute, three-part marathon: In spite of languid riffs and an occasional absence of drums, ""Dreamed"" never sits anywhere for too long and, more important, never bores. In several Eastern religions, atma means a more complete aware version of the self. Scheidt uses that word during the refrain (or mantra, maybe?) of ""Dreamed"", singing ""Self reaching outward/ Toward within"" at the apogee of the riff’s power. The bulk of Atma seems to be about some human realization that's more meaningful than the mundane, where change and finality and death and loss actually work toward something important. ""Burning within from what must be/ The desire of the one to be witnessed,"" he howls as if caught in mid-strangulation at the end of the title track, a menacing swirl of drums and distortion at his back. You can hear those ideas throughout Atma, a record that never takes the space it's been given for granted. Each passing second feels like a chance for a new thought, a happy diversion. That's not what you expect from the stasis and slow shifts of doom metal or anything with which YOB is generally associated. It's exactly what makes every bit of Atma so very powerful. If you were a novice forming a metal band in 2011, YOB's psychedelic heaviness might not be a bad place to start. It can, after all, be played at length with a basic riff, a drummer with some stamina and heavy hands, and a bassist that can find the roots of chords. It doesn’t require the speed of black metal, the equipment of drone, or the skill of death and technical metal. You don't even need an especially great singer: Scheidt is more communicative and versatile than dominating. What's more, it's a sound that's proven ripe for crossover into both indie rock and mainstream rock circles during the last decade. So why not? Indeed, there's a glut of bands currently mining post-Sabbath, after-Sleep stoner metal, playing lean, distorted riffs over clattering china. In that crowded lot, YOB should serve as a reminder that, even in more common forms, there are simply those who do it better-- through more experience, better conceits or, as is the case with Atma, a compelling mix of both. Scheidt's guitar tone is unimpeachable here, and he uses it as an unwavering guide for the trio: His riffs control the pushes and the pulls, the rises and the falls, the stops and the starts. And with YOB, a doom-stoner-sludge-psych band with too much thrust to fit into any of those holes for very long, that's the deciding, divining factor.","The Oregon doom metal trio's newest, an expansive album that never takes the space it's been given for granted, is a reminder that, in this crowded field, there are simply those who do it better.

1977,Terius Nash,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c79d034d5c69bf490d/1:1/w_160/e3a083d9.jpg,2011-09-08 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15792-1977/,Radio Killa,"1977 is-- to quote Terius Nash himself-- an ""Internet album."" Nash (aka The-Dream) released it for free on his website on August 31, with the begrudged blessing of his bosses at Def Jam. It's his fourth solo album, but his first released in this manner, and it raises the question of whether or not we are supposed to alter our expectations. Is this a tossed-off re-packaging of demos? Is he merely trying to satiate a fanbase waiting for an album that he promised to drop this past June? We don't know the answers to those questions (although my guesses would be ""no"" and ""maybe""), but it would seem foolish to hold 1977 to a lower standard. It's no longer unusual-- especially in the world of rap, and to a lesser extent R&B-- to put a full album on the Internet for free. If Nash had included a way for fans to pay what they wanted for the album, he would've been adopting a strategy utilized in previous years by Radiohead and Girl Talk. And yet, Nash is asking us to adjust our expectations. Crucially though, he's not asking that we alter our notions of what we expect of him, just what we expect from him. 1977 represents not a conscious change in quality, but a conscious change in style and sound, at least for the time being. A few days before he released the album, he tweeted, ""When I'm 40 ill write Myself a Pop Smash just so I can Perform on National TV. Not that hard to do. But that's not who I am right now."" True to his word, 1977 often strays far from Nash's few solo pop smashes. Instead, it is a deeply personal and presumably therapeutic album. It's one that he fought with his label to release, that he's putting out under his birth name and titled for his birth year, and for which he has put the lyrics of every song up on his website. Though he was predictably coy about the subject, the specter of his divorce from singer Christina Milian looms over it. In its sparseness and unrelenting directness, the album's most recent precedent is Kanye West's break up opus 808s & Heartbreak, and much like that record, it's already proven to be a divisive if misunderstood album. It showcases a bitter and angry Nash, and though he has previously dabbled in acidic and unflinching break-up songs, 1977 is his first album to largely focus on something other than his sexual prowess. Like West, his vitriol is mostly spewed outward, with seemingly little regard for the feelings or reputation of whoever is on the other side. There is Spanish guitar, as if Nash imagines himself readying for a duel. There is acoustic guitar, as if to accentuate his confessionals. And there is guitar feedback, as if his heart were screaming out. As a portrayal of a broken relationship, 1977 at its best is as vivid as it is one-sided. ""Wake Me When It's Over"", which effectively utilizes the glacial R&B of Drake and his producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, opens the album with a wrenching portrait of a romance falling apart in plain view of friends and the public. As Nash coos the chorus we find him frozen in amber, unable to shake a break up for which he claims he would've taken bullets. Even tracks like ""Rolex"" and ""Wish You Were Mine"", which don't hew as close to the theme as others, have a spitefulness that hint at an intense desire to throw your recovery in your ex's face. But of course, writing songs from this point of view presents some problems. Mainly, one has to be able to stomach the one-sided bile and Nash's likely half-truths. To that end, 1977, like West's 808s, functions best as a look inside the mind of a man wrecked by a trying relationship and a worse break up. His failings should not be excused, but the feelings exist, and have likely existed inside most of us at some point (regardless of gender), and to that end, they're understandable even if they're not completely acceptable. There are also essential moments on the album where Nash perhaps unwittingly reveals the more aggressively resentful songs to be a sort of Pyrrhic victory. One is on ""Form of Flattery"", where he addresses the ex he hates and seethes, ""I'm not better than that."" Another is ""Wedding Crasher"", the absolute standout here, wherein Nash shows up at his ex's wedding and admits, once and for all, that his attempts to replace her have been futile. Sonically, it recalls the buoyant lightness of Love King's ""Florida University"", though it's less cloying, and this time he's basically saying, ""fuck you"" back at himself. All that said, Nash still misses a huge opportunity. One of the legitimate criticisms of 808s was that West's ex had no forum to respond to the album. While it's obviously impossible to expect Nash to cede space on 1977 to Milian (or whomever), there is a critical difference between himself and West. Nash is a songwriter by trade who made his name writing from the perspective of people (mostly women) other than himself, including what may be the biggest female empowerment single of the past decade. When Nash does give the floor completely to a female voice, it's for the relatively unknown Casha to sing a cover of Deniece Williams' 1981 hit ""Silly"". As a tune, the song itself is fine, but framed by Nash's wrath it sadly comes off as pleading and passive. How great would it have been for Nash to use that spot on the album to turn the pen on himself, if only for one song? Still, 1977 itself is a success, even if it doesn't stand up completely to his three previous releases. As a standalone depiction of a deteriorating relationship and miserable break up, it's engrossing and, even to a fault, extremely honest. As a piece of music, it eschews the richness and lushness of those albums, a sound that's felt on the verge of becoming stale. 1977 could be called a palate cleanser, but it's way too torn-up to be that. It's more like a shot (or three) of whisky. Sometimes that feels like exactly what you need.","The-Dream self-released this intensely personal fourth solo collection for free.

Garden of Arms,Peter Wolf Crier,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c45e6ef9596932200f/1:1/w_160/fdfe6942.jpg,2011-09-07 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15791-garden-of-arms/,Jagjaguwar,"For their 2010 debut Inter-Be, Peter Pisano and Brian Moen of Peter Wolf Crier sat down and, in one night, churned out a series of solid, vintage-sounding folk songs. Then, the Minneapolis duo played 100 shows in a six-month span and-- with ""a new-found footing of confidence and experimentation,"" according to the press release-- sat down and recorded Garden of Arms. The confidence in their new record is clear, if only because their vocals sound more boisterous than ever, but for the most part, the experimentation is the problem. Keep in mind that ""experimentation"" for Peter Wolf Crier doesn't mean a Steve Reich or some dense soundscape. Instead, they needlessly streamlined their sound, creating the feel of a locationless, generic rock band. They've effectively replaced the old radio warmth of Inter-Be's ""Crutch & Cane"" with an emotionless electric guitar on ""Beach"" that brings to mind Audioslave-era Tom Morello. For percussion, they've opted for a militaristic snare that does little more than distract from every other layer. And while the vocals are more confident, the melodies are interchangeable. The opener, ""Right Away"", sets the tone with its repetitive, claustrophobic vocal treatment. The lyrics offer a collage of emotions that never seem to connect: Lines like ""All the inches flow"" and ""Right away you are the one"" hint at something meaningful, but never taking the time to provide actual meaning. Even when the emotions are clear, Pisano's melodramatic belting detracts from the weight of the heartbreak. High drama seems to be the aim of Garden of Arms, especially when you consider the majority of the lyrics are comprised of over-the-top emotional imagery like ""Lonely gardener it is time you woke the knight/ Kiss divine and hold his lips to your own light."" (Song titles like ""Haunt You"" don't help.) There are some welcome turns. ""Beach"" features an overarching percussion that sounds like swishing water, and the most satisfying moment on the track ""Hard Heart"" comes at the end, where a chorus of ethereal vocals serve as percussive accents. ""Cut a Hand"" makes a return to the muffled guitar warmth of their debut, and Pisano's vocals are markedly toned down, but again, the song is covered in Moen's heavy snares. Conversely, one of the best songs, ""Settling It Off"", tempers the melodrama of the lyrics with quiet percussion, tender vocals, and a simple fingerpicked guitar. It isn't until the final two tracks that their departure from Inter-Be pays off. On ""Never Meant to Love You"", Pisano sounds exhausted, perhaps from all the belting. There are still poetic analogies-- dead leaves and drought to evoke the end of a relationship-- but the instruments gradually get quieter. His vocals fade, and his regret turns to silence. The final track ""Wheel"" features even fewer instruments: The song's mainly backed by ghostly moans, the album devolving into a quiet static shuffle. It's a far cry from the clutter of ""Right Away"" and a welcome respite from the melodrama, making clear that the band is capable of great things in its new form.","The new-look Minneapolis folk duo's highly dramatic sophomore album features a welcome dose of confidence along with a sense of experimentation that doesn't always come off.

Geidi Primes,Grimes,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0995e6ef95969321fc8/1:1/w_160/4b87bd2a.png,2011-09-07 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15751-geidi-primes/,No Pain in PopArbutus,"In a recent interview with the New York Times Magazine blog (tagged: ""culture;"" previous post: ""The Novelty Knit""), 23-year-old Claire Boucher proudly described the music she makes under the name Grimes as ""post-Internet."" ""The music of my childhood was really diverse because I had access to everything,"" she said, and this omnivorousness is apparent in her eccentric, dreamy sound, which draws upon everything from dubstep to disco, Eastern music to 1990s R&B. Even before that interview, it was clear Grimes knew her way around a web browser. She first attracted an audience outside Montreal's DIY art and music scene when she put her earliest recordings online for free, and since then she's cultivated an online presence that makes equal room for her music and haunting visual art. She's even issued preemptive strikes against critics' misguided games of Spot the Influence (""I don't listen to Kate Bush, nor have I ever,"" she tweeted a few weeks ago-- a delightful bit of sacrilege from an artist who's probably never read an article about herself that didn't contain the word ""weirdo""). Whatever she’s doing, it's working: at the beginning of last year she was uploading to her MySpace the DIY bedroom recordings that would comprise her debut album, and now she and her art school haircut are posing in couture for Times online subscribers. (Just ask Salem-- shit doesn't get more post-Internet than that.) Now that debut album, Geidi Primes, is getting a good old fashioned CD/LP rerelease on the UK-based label No Pain in Pop. (Previously its only physical release was a limited-run cassette on Montreal’s flourishing experimental pop imprint Arbutus.) Coming on the heels of her terrific material on the tantalizingly brief Darkbloom split EP, the Geidi Primes' re-release is a wisely timed holdover for the months before her next LP comes out early next year. But Geidi Primes is much more than a quaint indicator of how far Grimes has come in the past year and a half. Despite its modest production values and relative simplicity, it's a cohesive, enchanting, and surprisingly assured debut. Even though it clocks in at a slight 30 minutes, Geidi Primes is a wholly immersive listen. The melodies are hooky and sweet, but each track has a throbbing undercurrent of menace that pulls you in like a riptide. It's hard to pinpoint exactly from where this pervading element of darkness springs-- especially since, on paper, most of the lyrics read like valentines. (Pretty much every discernable chorus revolves around the word ""heart."") The hypnotic standout ""Feyd Rautha Dark Heart"" begins with a simple Casio-style beat and an ostensibly sugary hook-- ""I won't break your heart in the dark""-- but the track builds into something decidedly eerie: chilly synth hits, zombified vocals, and percussion that sounds like rattling bones. By the end, even the sweet refrain sounds less like an expression of devotion and more like a chant meant to put you under some kind of spell. Which, you come to realize, is Geidi Primes' main objective. Perhaps Geidi Primes' greatest virtue is its resourcefulness: It excels at crafting evocative moods from deceivingly simple sonic materials and song structures. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the simple, looping bassline of ""Rosa"", the brightest and most unabashedly straightforward song on the record, and also the one most likely to stay lodged in your head for days. Then there’s the brief, wordless ""Gambang"" making utter gorgeousness from nothing more than a slightly warped sample and breathy falsetto curlicues. As a vocalist, Grimes knows how to work her range. Though she's become known for her impressive falsetto (which she pushes to rapturous, Donna Summer-like heights on the Darkbloom single ""Vanessa"") and she can occasionally pull of a spooky low tone that's faintly reminiscent of Karin Dreijer Andersson, she spends much of Geidi Primes in mid-range, tuneful deadpan, which lends wry humor to the lines she coos to a lover on ""Zoal, Face Dancer"": ""Everybody thinks that I'm boring/ Many people think I've got no clue."" Just because she's spacey-- yes, nerds, those are Dune references scattered throughout the track listing-- doesn't mean she's without earthly wit. It takes a pretty good sense of humor to write an utterly gorgeous closer and call it ""Beast Infection"". Given her restlessly prolific creativity (she followed up Geidi Primes with another solid 2010 release, Halfaxa) and the bounding artistic strides she's displayed with her recent singles, Grimes could very well be poised for a meteoric rise with the release of her next full length. But Geidi Primes shows that even her earliest recordings displayed a distinct point of view and an oddly mesmerizing quality. There’s something refreshingly ""post-Internet"" about that too-- a dreamy soundscape that invites an escape from the glitchy universe, a brief provocation to let go and just bliss out.","Claire Boucher's cassette-only debut of ""post-Internet"" DIY bedroom recordings gets an old-fashioned CD/LP release. Following a wave of hype, the re-release is a wisely timed holdover for the months before her next album comes out, but the immersive, enchanting collection is more than a quaint indicator of how far Grimes has come in the past year and a half.

The Years EP,Memoryhouse,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c6ea9e61561daa6693/1:1/w_160/a120f40b.jpeg,2011-09-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15788-memoryhouse-the-years-ep/,Sub Pop,"For those curious how this refurbished and remastered version of a previously released EP can be given a lower mark than the orginal, please note that the score is more about the release than the band. As someone smitten with the original and Memoryhouse's ""ambient shoegaze,"" I was hoping the update would be a promised ""new and improved"" version. To be clear, the EP is technically all new material: Three tracks from the old EP (""Sleep Patterns"", ""Lately (Deuxième)"", ""To The Lighthouse"") were re-recorded and the pleasant interlude ""The Waves"" is replaced with two song-like tracks, ""Modern, Normal"" and ""Quiet America"". The new tracks-- the hook for folks that have the original The Years-- are pleasant, if unsurprising. Other than the appearance of live drums on ""Modern, Normal"", they offer a slightly different variation on what Evan Abeele and Denise Nouvion have done previously. Ironically, it's on the old/new tracks where The Years shows the group spreading its wings, though not necessarily in a becoming manner. Of the three returnees, only ""Sleep Patterns"" comes through sounding like its previous version. There are small yet noticeable changes made to the arrangement-- the addition of strings (or string-like sounds) being the most apparent. The track sounds more robust, but it's otherwise about the same. While ""Lately"" loses the cassette-tape ambiance that dovetailed nicely with its Eternal Sunshine score sample, it's also not unrecognizable. That said, the exchange of that home-recording coziness for some bright and shiny opulence is a bit disconcerting. Then there's ""To the Lighthouse"", which undergoes an extreme makeover: The group swaps out the original's shimmering intro and its relaxed yet propulsive trip-hop-like gait for some kids-at-play found-sound samples and a decidedly less jaunty pace. As a result, the track that stood out for the change of pace it offered now falls in line with Memoryhouse's primary M.O. Despite my own misgivings about these re-recordings, these new versions aren't bad by any stretch-- they just seem unnecessary. While it's nice to hear what Memoryhouse would've done with these older tracks if they were produced in a proper studio, the end result is akin to a more famous attempt at an after-the-fact fine-tuning: filmmaker George Lucas' seemingly endless tweaking and CGI-ing of the original Star Wars trilogy. The band makes mention of Lucas on its blog, while promising that this EP isn't on the same level as Lucas' compulsive tinkering. But the question that  Star Wars fans continually ask themselves is a question that some fans of The Years might also have: Why go back and fix something that wasn't broken? To fuss over those old tracks, especially in light of how little the band has actually recorded, seems regressive. The overall intent of this release-- to put an actual, physical copy of  The Years out into the world for folks who aren't up to speed on their online music research-- is understandable, and even justifiable, on many levels. But for folks who have been living with these songs for over a year, offering two passable new tracks next to these three remakes isn't nearly good enough.","After signing to Sub Pop, the Toronto dream pop duo re-records and re-works its debut EP, raising the question: Why go back and fix something that wasn't broken?

Lenses Alien,Cymbals Eat Guitars,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a013d197565213a4d1/1:1/w_160/9fea7f95.jpeg,2011-09-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15757-lenses-alien/,BarsukMemphis Industries,"Cymbals Eat Guitars have followed Why There Are Mountains, their self-released debut of 1990s indie rock alchemy, with a difficult and likely divisive sophomore LP. Which isn't all that surprising-- these things happen when the ""next step"" involves signing to a label, hiring a venerated producer (John Agnello, who also worked this year with alt-revivalists Male Bonding), turning over half of your personnel, and releasing an 8 1/2-minute song as the ""first single."" Here's the thing: Lenses Alien doesn't really sound all that different from Why There Are Mountains, which is a tribute to how fully formed and musically tight CEG were right out of the gate. Perhaps the most challenging thing about Lenses Alien is how it makes what it sounds like fairly unimportant: Like last time, almost none of its sonic touchstones exist outside of the Clinton administration, but Joseph D'Agostino takes an enormous leap of faith by doubling down on his brick-thick verbiage during a lyrics-first record that puts more confidence in the listener's attention span than pretty much anything else I've heard this year. It's become something of a cliché to praise an ""album in the mp3 age,"" and while Lenses Alien certainly isn't intended to be strip-mined for singles, it's meant to be experienced on a remarkably micro level. It's actually more ambitious than the already grand Mountains, but it doesn't manifest in Byzantine song structure or far-flung sonic touches. While there's a peripheral shift from the more blue-collar, populist likes of Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, and the Wrens into the deconstructive and unfairly less celebrated Cap'n Jazz (when it's loud) and the Appleseed Cast (when it's quiet), the craft is evident in how every lyric and riff is exactingly honed to be of near equal importance. The rest of Lenses Alien doesn't take after the sprawl of ""Rifle Eyesight (Proper Name)""-- it's about twice as long as anything else-- but it lays out the record's rules of engagement. I've talked with others who consider its flow to be somewhat clunky, which is understandable considering what listeners typically expect from a song of that length, particularly an opener. There's not an epic build or a cataclysmic blowout: D'Agostino occupies the mind of an unstable, possibly predatory narrator, changing perspective and mood from verse to verse, the extended floods of physically punishing guitar feedback acting as outbursts of mental anguish linking unorthodox yet accessible and sprightly vocal lines. I'll call it anticlimactic as a compliment: Over an ugly, gnarled cluster of notes, D'Agostino asks, ""What former police sits at the bus stop offering rides?” and the song ends abruptly like a stunning reveal. After eight minutes of psychodrama played out in his head, the camera pans out for you to imagine the yellowed teeth or cold, vacant stare of its main character. So many of Lenses Alien's enduring moments come from these mergers of sensation-- the chorus of ""oh-whoas"" from tired passengers on the cunningly catchy ""Shore Points"" underlining an abrupt change of plans along the Jersey coastline; a picture of motorboats and Styrofoam coolers amidst the burst of crowd-pleasing guitars during ""Keep Me Waiting"". Then there's the liquid, unsteady near-instrumental of ""The Current"" stopping to make a brief and lucid prayer for a universe free of physical suffering, while ""Gary Condit"" offers the record's final grasp at understanding: ""Is it teeth-shaking polyphony, grace, and completion or nothing?"" delivered as an unholy, desperate cry for help. The need for release runs throughout Lenses Alien, as it condenses the spacious travelogues of Mountains into claustrophobic ruminations on the metaphysical, moving cars, and D'Agostino's mind existing as purgatories. ""Plainclothes"" opens suggesting a True Crime story, but it's a passing thought during a paranoid drive up a New York highway interspersed with startling, vivid details-- the tricks cops pull on unsuspecting drivers during initiation season, the sensation of being haunted by ghosts of past partiers in a guest house. This unsettling otherworldliness continues through ""Definite Darkness"", a mysterious police investigation causing a sleepless night that fades out on a coda of wearied sighs. Considering all the paranoia and fleeting revelations, drugs unsurprisingly play a big role here, particularly psychedelics whose side effects are less about hedonism than discovery. D'Agostino and friends have relatable freak outs and puke in sand dunes, pass out with their shoes on, roll down hills on skateboards, and remark upon how ""dried mushrooms taste a lot like communion wafers."" They’re disarmingly naïve about worlds opening up to them, seeing gas leaks, air force bases, and the suburban and rural expanses of the northeast United States as reflections of celestial significance. The downside is how the music occasionally buckles under the weight of its own restlessness and D'Agostino’s words-- a slightly skewed ratio of visceral immediacy to cerebral satisfaction making it a slight notch below Why There Are Mountains. While packed with forceful riffs and quirky melodic turns, ""Another Tunguska"" and ""Secret Family"" are such slippery compositions that D'Agostino's backing can sometimes feel incidental. But once you stop looking for the hooks and choruses as they might be defined traditionally, dozens of inventive melodies emerge: Is the elegant, Elliott Smith-esque melody of ""Shore Points"" less sticky because there’s no chorus? Do the soulfully swooping harmonies of ""Wavelengths"" constitute a chorus even though the lyrics don’t repeat? I suppose it's indicative of Lenses Alien's strange magnetism that it raises as many questions when it's catchy as it does when it's inscrutable. After all, it's so thick with overlapping images, memories, stray thoughts, and second guessing that I sense D'Agostino's asking us throughout: How real are our own emotions? Are you guessing at your own feelings? It's heavy stuff, never answered in an easy way, and can really feel out of step with their peers who treat lyrics as placeholders and thoughts as fact. More than the sound of the 90s, Lenses Alien recalls, at least to these ears, the way we might’ve interacted with those records at the time: poring over the lyrics sheet, having a real sense of investment. It's no slight to say Lenses Alien isn't at the level of Perfect From Now On or The Moon and Antarctica -- it's not a masterpiece. But while Why There Are Mountains reminded me of what those records sounded like, Lenses Alien does something more difficult by reminding what it felt like once they were over and you were left to wonder if you just stumbled upon a cosmic, philosophical treatise disguised as an indie rock record.","The Staten Island quartet follows Why There Are Mountains, its self-released debut of 1990s indie rock alchemy, with a difficult and potentially divisive sophomore LP, a lyrics-first record that puts confidence in the listener's attention span.

Looping State of Mind,The Field,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c35e6ef9596932200b/1:1/w_160/d5d9666b.jpg,2011-09-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/,Kompakt,"The title of the Field's third album, Looping State of Mind, might have you thinking that producer Axel Willner is getting back to basics. Especially after he strayed, with only intermittent success, from his instantly recognizable template on his 2009 sophomore record, Yesterday and Today. After all, at its simplest, techno is music that can be built with just a few loops. And Willner's first few records certainly made effective use of the form, layering shimmering loops of voice and synth and guitar on each track until he'd built a fluffy and infinitely soothing wall of sound. Immersive and repetitive, the Field's first singles and 2007 debut album, From Here We Go Sublime, were like ambient records disguised as both experimental techno and luscious pop. So is Looping State of Mind a return to that sound, the one that made the Field a crossover favorite with rock kids a few years back? Not exactly. In a few instances it's barely recognizable as ""the Field"" at all. It may be still be built from loops, but Willner's never orchestrated so many of them so artfully into such dense and infinitely listenable soundscapes. Good thing, too, because the last few years have seen a lot of bedroom producers become briefly famous for ambient records disguised as pop, for amorphous electronic doodles disguised as songs. Instead of coasting, as one of the inadvertent models for the current ""chill"" thing, a producer who'd probably earn infinite props just for repeating himself, Willner decided to put 99 percent of his acolytes to shame here. True, there are still tracks, like ""It's Up There"", that recall Willner's best-loved stuff, but even they feel richer, like the early Field in 3D and high-def. ""Arpeggiated Love"" is on the one hand a dead-ringer for the propulsive, ecstatic sound-wash of From Here We Go Sublime. But Willner now fleshes it out with shiver-inducing soul music harmonies that owe less to sleek German techno than gospel-tinged American house. True, he was quoting classic soul group the Flamingos as early as Sublime, but he's never been so overt in dipping into dance music's global history. As that might suggest, Looping often strays far from the Field we know, into territory that recalls deep house, post-punk, shoegaze, noise-rock, and cosmic techno. And he manages to swirl them all together in a way that makes his earliest attempts to fuse ambient and trance feel like gorgeous apprentice work. Yesterday and Today sometimes sounded hesitant, as if Willner didn't quite know how to make his music fresh for a second time. On Looping he packs all seven tracks with curveballs, and each new direction feel successful, vital, surprising. At one point on opener ""Is This Power"", everything drops away except for an eerie bass twang that recalls Joy Division or the Cure circa ""A Forest"", but when the boogie bass finally drops back in, you're not only reminded that this is dance music, it's easily the funkiest Field tune you've probably yet heard. The rhythms on Looping are more varied than anything the Willner's done before. Though he hasn't entirely abandoned that programmed motorik pulse that drove Sublime, his work with live bands over the last few years has clearly fed into Looping. ""Then It's White"" summons a Yorke-less Radiohead, with the way the drums subtly mesh human fluency and digital tech. And that's not even counting the Amnesiac-like mix of pensive piano and mournful, computer-warped vocals. Despite the sometimes winning simplicity of his music, Willner was no slouch as a producer before. Yet listening to this album, there's no doubt he's grown way more assured and inventive over the last two years. And he's brought all his skill to bear on Looping, as composer and arranger and texturologist, in order to build something this simultaneously sweeping and subtle, deep and immediate. It could still alienate those perpetually pining for copies of ""A Paw in My Face"" or ""Sun and Ice"". But if they listen more deeply, they might just hear Willner’s masterpiece-to-date.","The music on the Field's third album may be still be built from loops, but Axel Willner has never orchestrated so many of them so artfully.

"Work (work, work)",HTRK,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b75e6ef95969321ff9/1:1/w_160/dec61007.jpg,2011-09-06 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15776-work-work-work/,Ghostly,"Bands that find their voice quickly are the lucky ones. Of course, you run a greater risk of repeating yourself in the future, but by and large the hardest part is already out of the way. HTRK (pronounced ""Hate Rock"") aren't what you would normally consider lucky, both professionally and personally. Formed in 2003, the trio's no wave-leaning art noise found them playing alongside deities like Alan Vega and Lydia Lunch. In 2009, their debut LP, Marry Me Tonight (co-produced by ex-Birthday Party member Roland S. Howard), landed them a few high-profile opening slots for the likes of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Liars. And it made sense: Marry Me is doomy and romantically languid, with a pop-smart crispness that spoke of potentially good things to come. But when bassist Sean Stewart took his own life in March of last year, vocalist Jonnine Standish and guitarist Nigel Yang were left to pick up the pieces and push forward with their second full length, Work (work, work). While dark and otherworldly, much of Work doesn't feel like it has much to do with death, but everything to do with sex. But they've shifted their sound, and in the current climate they come over as zeitgeist chasers without much character. The music of the past year or so has been hot for dark and moody sounds, from the fleeting pulses of the witch house craze to the dread-stoked, depressive underpinnings that pervade various electronic and R&B offshoots. HTRK also seem to have noticed, inflecting their sound with creepy, crawling signifiers that feel currently cool or just past their expiration date. The crucial distinction is that HTRK have a noticeably minimal sound, funneling their groaning and clanking through no wave and coldwave instead of the viscous twitch-and-bounce of witch house proper (though the drum programming suggests the Three 6 Mafia presets came stock) or the lurid, lukewarm comeliness of jj or the xx (though both of these artists are good for a name-check at just about any moment on the album). So needless to say, Work is heavy on atmosphere, and while the attention paid to those aforementioned post punk totems could have set them apart (at times it feels as if HTRK could pull off a lounge-y mix-up of Sade and Suicide), there simply isn't enough to sink your teeth into. Occasionally constructed of some interesting parts (the processional G-funk organ squiggles on single ""Eat Yr Heart"", the pressure-crunched submarine hull moans of ""Slo Glo""), nothing seems properly supported. The music feels unappetizingly narcotized and drab, not to mention uncomfortably claustrophobic despite all of the aimless sprawling and spreading the music does. The pair seems to have been so focused on creating a mood that they forgot to attach any songs along the way. Perhaps most anesthetizing of all is Standish, whose coquettish, layered vocals make all the chic disaffection feel even more purposefully (and problematically) clouded. There's nothing especially bad here, but once the smoke clears from their bland, bassed-out ambiance, HTRK are another band without a sound to call their own.","After the suicide of bassist Sean Stewart last year, the no wave-leaning art noise duo pushes forward with its second full-length.

Anthology,Throwing Muses,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bd9d034d5c69bf48fe/1:1/w_160/7a11f60b.jpg,2011-09-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15781-throwing-muses-anthology/,4AD,"In 1983, at age 16, Kristin Hersh was hit by a car. She landed on her head and lost a lot of blood. When she was recovering in the hospital she started, for the first time, to hear songs-- ""sonic hauntings,"" as she called them in her 2010 memoir, Rat Girl. Initially humming, mechanical tones, they quickly organized themselves into the familiar grammar of guitar chords, drum beats, basslines, and surreal melodies. She didn't feel quite right until she got them out of her head: ""As soon as I give a song a body in the real world, it stops playing and I breathe a sigh of relief, in precious silence."" She played the chords herself and taught the other parts to her friends Dave Narcizo and Leslie Langston and her stepsister Tanya Donelly, and they became the earliest material recorded by their band, Throwing Muses. It's a hell of a creation myth, but an easy one to believe: pretty much every song Throwing Muses ever recorded sounds like an exorcism. Though indebted to punk's passion, fury, and occasional goofiness, the Muses were punks only in the spiritual sense of the word: Even by their teens, the original four were all accomplished musicians well-versed enough in music theory to create the weird, irregular chords and erratic time signatures that would become hallmarks of their sound. There was something almost Zen-like about the band's approach: Dump the contents of your busy brain out onto the street, and see what sounds they make on impact. The offspring of hippie idealism (Hersh grew up living on a commune and calling her dad ""Dude"") and post-punk disillusionment, the Muses' rhetoric was not about breaking the rules so much as transcending them completely. In a recent interview, Hersh said of her earliest days in the band, ""I realized that in order to play with the voice you would have if you grew up on a desert island without a radio you need to forget rules."" Anthology, the first retrospective collection of Throwing Muses material, comes to us on the 25th anniversary of their (first) self-titled record, a stammering, brutal masterpiece that managed to capture both late adolescent angst and feelings well beyond its years. Producer Gil Norton made Hersh's most intimate moments of near-delirium sound epic: like portions of someone's diary blown up to billboard size. Ever wary of commercial appeal, the band said it didn’t want to make anthems, so before its next record its label 4AD passed Norton onto the opening act on the Muses' European tour, fellow Bostonian scenesters Pixies, who were looking for someone to record their next album, Doolittle. Though the histories of the two bands are deeply, famously entwined, the Muses have enjoyed a fate harder to identify than the burden of being hugely influential (even though they were in certain corners: It's almost impossible to imagine the visceral bleats of singers like Corin Tucker or Marissa Paternoster without Kristin Hersh). This moment of reunions, reissues, and boundless nostalgia seems a good time to ask: where did Throwing Muses fit in? Anthology doesn't quite answer this question. Neither an exhaustive box set nor a greatest-hits collection, Anthology is more like mixtape personally compiled by the band, making a very characteristically Muses argument for the personal over the canonical, for a song’s appeal as something that's more subjective than objective. Though it eschews chronology and omits some of their most popular tracks (there’s only one song on here from 1991’s The Real Ramona-- and it’s the deep cut ""Two Step""), Anthology is still an accessible entry point to the band’s formidably deep catalogue-- for the already initiated, it’s a relatively taut refresher. The first disc is 21 tracks culled from major Muses releases, skewing heaviest on their late-80s output-- over half of the material comes from a three-year run that spanned the exquisitely dank Chains Changed EP to the somewhat brighter Hunkpapa in 1989. There are classics (""Fish"", ""Hate My Way"", ""Marriage Tree"", ""Bright Yellow Gun"") and a few surprises (""Mr. Bones"", ""Two Step"", ""Pretty or Not""), but there’s a remarkable cohesion to the collection’s flow. When the band released its 2003 self-titled album after a long absence, even its biggest fans were kind of astonished at how well the group had been able to capture the sound and spirit of its earliest recordings. Two songs from that ""reunion"" album made the cut here: I'd bet anything that Anthology listeners coming to the band for the first time wouldn't be able to pick them out of the bunch without peeking at the liner notes. Naturally, the B-sides and rarities disc is spottier-- I could live comfortably in a world without the tepid version of ""Amazing Grace"" or the instrumental ""Manic Depression"", which could pass for the interstitial music on an old Ken Griffey baseball video game. But once you get to the material from the Firepile EPs, it offers a killer middle stretch: ""Snailhead"" (featuring one of the most blistering Hersh vocals on the whole collection) segues into the smoldering slow-burner ""City of the Dead"". I’ve actually found myself spinning Disc 2 more than Disc 1, probably just because most of the material is fresher to my ears. It's not the most essential entry in their discography, but it's solid. To some people, the word Anthology might promise something bigger or more definitive than what the Muses have given us here, but most fans will appreciate the personal flourishes all over this collection (especially Hersh's always poetic liner notes). Anthology isn't exactly a totemic bookend to Throwing Muses' long and lively career, but as the band’s 2003 record and upcoming reunion tour suggest, maybe there’s still too much life in them for a definitive ending.","On the 25th anniversary of their debut, Throwing Muses release the 2xCD retrospective Anthology. It's more a mixtape compiled by the band than an exhaustive box set or greatest-hits collection, but it's still an accessible entry point to the band’s formidably deep catalogue.

Violent Hearts,Shimmering Stars,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c013d197565213a4f6/1:1/w_160/23e5fe02.jpeg,2011-09-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15782-violent-hearts/,Hardly ArtAlmost Musique,"Shimmering Stars are a trio from British Columbia who certainly have the sounds of the past down pat. The band was founded after its figurehead, guitarist Rory McClure, binged on old performance footage of the Everly Brothers. The swaying melodies and dippy, falsetto-speckled vocals on the band's debut LP, Violent Hearts, are the marks of that influence. But as the title suggests, though, this stuff veers from swooning romanticism. They make pleas for self-medication and express vague emotional confusion throughout. One of the album's most optimistic songs, ""I'm Gonna Try"", begins: ""Walking down the street/ And I wanna kill everyone I meet."" Later, when Shimmering Stars complain about ""Dancing to Music I Hate"", it seems like a comparatively uncomplicated personal problem. Like a lot of young bands lately, Shimmering Stars' affectations can be easily traced back to Deerhunter, another group that filters experience through sounds and textures plucked from music's past. And if Shimmering Stars don't quite reach the same level of noisy euphoria anywhere on Violent Hearts, the surprising consistency of the record as a whole-- if you're a sucker for one song on here, you're a sucker for all of 'em-- is more than enough to make up for any lack of assertiveness. As a full-length listening experience, Violent Hearts is a little much-- it runs just under a lean half-hour, but the relative lack of stylistic breadth covered makes a front-to-back spin feel longer. Another issue is the production value; Violent Hearts was self-recorded by McClure in his parents' garage (cheekily referred to in the album's liner notes as ""The Garage Mahal""). While the homespun charm adds some ghostly distance to these songs, it's frustrating to imagine what they would sound like with some better mics (and maybe a real recording studio, too). There's no shortage of emotional bloodshed here, but any horror geek will tell you that blood just doesn't look as good in black-and-white.","This trio from British Columbia has a way of running music from the distant past through a noisy filter that owes something to Deerhunter; if they never quite reach that band's level of  euphoria, they're still off to a good start.

Ruin,Elite Gymnastics,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bec0084474cd0c1cde/1:1/w_160/f4469c9e.jpeg,2011-09-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15779-r-u-i-n-1-2/,Acéphale,"The story of music is largely a story about machines. Just as developments in recording and broadcasting technologies drove 20th-century pop, the Internet and accessible music software are driving something new in the 21st century. Its contours are getting clearer as the first generation to grow up with it comes of age. These musicians are sweeping away the vestiges of generic lineage and regional identity. Unselfconsciously mingling the prefab, the pilfered, and the original, they have none of their elders' qualms about samples and virtual instruments. Many live outside of major culture centers, and thrive online rather than onstage, working with sophisticated editing tools in relative isolation to construct their idiosyncratic visions. The production duo Elite Gymnastics is a perfect example of this diaspora of younger musicians. James Brooks and Josh Clancy live in Minneapolis, but this tells us little about them-- the Internet is their habitat, not a conduit. Their music is proudly unaffiliated, cobbling together influences that will probably strike older listeners as disparate and younger ones as perfectly concordant. The band's name comes from a song by power electronics pioneers Whitehouse, and noise terrorism is latent in their churning tone and freighted lyrics (which are barely audible but have an evil vibe). The drum breaks come from jungle and hip-hop, the radiantly smeared textures from shoegaze and drone-rock, the samples from video games. They're comfortable mixing Waka Flocka Flame or Ryuichi Sakamoto, chopping Final Fantasy theme music into Balearic house or tending to ghostly, blackened whirrs. According to the band, they used chillwave to Trojan Horse these diverse sounds into complacent earbuds. Whether or not you buy that line, the only chillwave thing about RUIN 1 is how miscellaneous listening habits dissolve in a solution of over-stimulated memory and prodigious sonic options. There's nothing slackened or balmy about it, no pink Christmas lights or plastic palm trees. It's a rugged, mercurial terrain with heatwaves blasting off it. Jungle drums slice through dark, grainy atmospheres flashing with techno synths (""So Close to Paradise""), and the only thing separating throbbing Spacemen 3-style rock (""Little Things"") and gentle vintage shoegaze (""Omamori"") is the fizzy electro of ""Here, in Heaven"". The through-line is a pitched, exciting contest between aggressive percussion and emotive melody. The drums are often taut and frantic, but great floating swaths of texture provide a nebulous weight. Besides the frequently inconsequential vocals, the only downside is some murky mixing, with lots of uncompressed clutter. Blurry but lucid is a very tricky sound to nail, and Elite Gymnastics are getting good mileage out of raw energy while they work it out. That's why RUIN 2-- which basically borrows the idea of chopped and screwed remix discs from rap-- is more than a supplement. It actually improves some of the original mixes by clearing out the dense thatching, letting them breathe. The original version of ""Here, in Heaven"" sounds flat compared to the second, a yawning chasm that evokes the ambient dub of Brock Van Wey. ""Little Things"" also gains distinction with its vocal hung between huge, skeletal pulses and silvery curls of ambiance. But this isn't to say that Elite Gymnastics should only make cored-out dub: ""Minneapolis Belongs to You"" lets some light and air into RUIN 1 with refreshing results. And do you also detect a tacit ""(But Not to Me)"" after that title? If folk music's domain was regional and pop's was global, this music lives beyond the world, where ideas floating through waves and wires take on an independent, hermetic life.","As this compilation of the previously issued RUIN 1 and RUIN 2 EPs illustrates, the music of the Whitehouse-referencing Minneapolis production duo of James Brooks and Josh Clancy is proudly unaffiliated, cobbling together influences from jungle to hip-hop to noise to shoegaze.

In the Grace of Your Love,The Rapture,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c113d197565213a4fa/1:1/w_160/7d91a8cd.jpg,2011-09-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15783-in-the-grace-of-your-love/,DFA,"Looking back, the Rapture's legacy is as a galvanizing force for the underground, busting indie rock's standstill so mightily that we're now embarrassed to be the guy not dancing. They never seemed like a good bet to break dance music to the mainstream audiences, though, no matter how hard iTunes insists that the closing track on my copy of 2006's Pieces of the People We Love is titled ""Best Buy Exclusive."" Pan-pop conspiracy theorists might note that the Rapture reached fever-pitch in New York in 2003, or right around the time that Lady Gaga was enrolling at NYU, but if the Rapture hadn't stopped their own momentum, someone would have stopped it for them: likely labelmate/mentor/producer James Murphy, whose LCD Soundsystem offered the same funk-punk grooves but had better jokes (well, had jokes period) and a more explosive live presence, with pathos to boot. The Rapture were too nervy and out-of-sync to ascend the ranks. None of that changes the fact that the Rapture return, minus a surly Youtube non-sensation, at a time when house and disco are more fashionable than at any time since the early 1980s. See Gaga, see Hercules and Love Affair, see couture Daft Punk Lego dolls, see the fact that Chris Brown knows a French guy. The Rapture, always medium opportunists, aren't interested in taking advantage of this. They've become what they've always threatened to become: an art-rock band with predilections for boogie and dippy lyrics. Grace sounds like the Rapture without retreading past successes, a nifty trick that underscores the band's hard-won identity. The Rapture are a pretty good art-rock band, too: Grace is fleshier than its predecessors, with horns, needlework guitar, and Jenner's brash voice filling the negative space the band used to gift to the dance floor. They deftly respond to choral background vocals, funky synth slabs, and tasteful guitar fills. A group that was once a combustible ball of energy is now a functioning nervous system with a keen sense of pace and texture. You can hear notes of U2's propulsive anthems (""Sail Away""), Talking Heads' agitated funk (""Can You Find a Way""), and XTC's ballast pop (""Rollercoaster""). You can forgive them for envying Cut Copy's hot-knife-through-butter crowd uniters (""Children""). Grace is the band's mature album, by their own reckoning: Press for the record has almost unanimously focused on the members' stroller-pushing benders, how frontman Luke Jenner spent time playing softball, attending church, and coping with the loss of his mother. Stability and love dominate its themes, the title cutting think-pieces off at the pass by invoking grace directly: This album is about sustained, earned love, as well as the forgiveness inherent in it. When it clicks, it's triumphant. My two favorite songs are two of the most explicitly groove-oriented, ramped to tempos at which Jenner's alkaline voice can't help but cast hooks. ""Miss You"" attempts to reconcile with his mother, while ""Never Die Again"" pleads for a healthy relationship, topics flung far from dance music's typical fare. Of course, if the songs were about Lunchables or macroeconomics, I'd love them just them same; such is the draw when Jenner turns his nasal pipes to siren. Therein lies the fallacy of the Rapture's maturity: Jenner has always played peek-a-boo with God and serenity (previous albums included songs titled ""Love Is All"", ""Live in the Sunshine"", and ""Open Up Your Heart"", not forgetting that the name of the band is the Rapture). On Grace he does so with more explicit inspiration, but he's a fumbling lyricist, better suited for tunneling into our Nikes than our hearts. Jenner used to scrap and cluck for our attention more often; he's had better luck wrangling sentiment out of a yelp than a platitude (the best disco singers handle both). His finest moment is on lead single ""How Deep Is Your Love?"", the galloping, piano-driven tour de force that so many Chicago house revivalists have failed to nail. Here, the rollicking pianos match his devotional pitch, the wilding sax echoing his hallelujahs. Still, Jenner can feel like a man without a country. He doesn't have the pipes for the sustained howling of ""Sail Away"", ""Blue Bird"", or the title track (a misplaced, tedious centerpiece). Nor does the sentiment of soul-sided closer ""It Takes Time to Be a Man"" lend itself to his tonal irreverence and pizzazz. Of all the naughties indie giants thinking hard about domesticity (LCD, Animal Collective, the National), the Rapture's medium is least primed for the message. This isn't the Rapture's fault, necessarily. ""House of Jealous Lovers"" is such a totem amid the last decade of indie that it's easy to forget they began as a somewhat (no pun) catholic punk band. In the Grace of Your Love takes two large steps back from ""dance punk."" Nearly a decade after ""Jealous Lovers"", they're a patient, skilled rock band unafraid to look uncool. If they sound extra comfy here it's probably because discomfort pervaded their best work so completely. The band's personal choices-- to abandon rock iconography for smaller, more fulfilling family units-- will be Grace's fate as well: a record without broader narratives, meant for those who grew up with the Rapture, or want to.","The galvanizing New York dance-punk trio returns with a long-anticipated third album that sounds like the Rapture without retreading past successes. It's a nifty trick that underscores the band's hard-won identity and it happens to come at a time when house and disco are more fashionable than any period since the early 1980s.

Glazin',Jacuzzi Boys,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bbc0084474cd0c1cd8/1:1/w_160/3eec603f.jpg,2011-09-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15775-jacuzzi-boys-glazin/,Hardly Art,"Garage rock was never an album's game, and-- in the midst of yet another revival-- that hasn't changed. Scuzzbucket strum and teenage truth will always fare far better as short, sharp shocks; then as now, the impact of a song like the Seeds' mighty ""Pushin' Too Hard"" is dulled by the half-dozen soundalikes on the LP from whence it came. Good as many of them are, that this new crop has yet to produce a truly classic LP isn't terribly surprising-- the song's the thing, cohesion's almost antithetical. So it is with Floridian up-and-comers Jacuzzi Boys' sophomore set, Glazin': five fine 45s masquerading as a fun, slight 10-song LP. Between their sweetly shopworn lyrics, their not-quite-frenetic pacing, and all those ooh-augmented choruses, there's nothing new under the Glazin' sun. The Boys have settled down some since their last LP, 2009's No Seasons: volumes mostly steer clear of the red zone; the songcraft's less rollicking, more measured; and the occasional glint of pop sheen flickers at its surface. Singer/guitarist Gabriel Alcala's maintained the snide edge in his voice, but he doesn't have the fire in his belly he did a couple of years ago. At this point, these teenaged kicks of their work feel less lived than lived-in, lacking the manic edge and the neuron-branding melodies of the genre's leading lights. The songs go down easy but, with a few exceptions, leave little aftertaste. When you're constantly flipping a 45, that's a good problem to have; when you're talking an LP-- even a shortie like Glazin'-- the amnesiac feel foregrounds what's lacking. Opener ""Vizcaya"" is a blast, a rallying cry of ascending melody and youthful insouciance that gets it done in record time. And the one-two punch of closers ""Los Angeles"" and ""Koo Koo With You""-- the first, a half-affectionate, half-dismissive take on left coast life, and the second, a shapeshifting half-nonsensical come-on-- are far and away the album's best. Brimming with personality and oddly pitched humor, they're really the only tracks on Glazin' that don't sound like covers of songs you can't quite place. (They would've made for a killer single.) Elsewhere, ""Silver Spheres"" throws a little Detroit thunder in there to fine effect, and the bouncy ""Libras and Zebras"" feels especially effortless. As for the rest? Carefully crafted, smartly executed, and  reasonably lively garage-rock that's all just a little too on-the-nose to inspire much beyond agreeable indifference. In an era when the surfeit of garage-rock bands need to push personality and melody harder than ever, Glazin's got a bit of both, an abundance of neither. The beefy but slightly sterile production buffs out some of the gnarl of their earlier work, which doesn't do them many favors. And the once-raucous band's performances seem a bit reeled in, too. More than anything, though, Glazin's sneer'n'strut is just too much of a pretty good thing: One or two at a time, these songs work wonders, but over half an hour, the Boys' retrograde sneer and strut proves a bit too safe and samey.","The second album from these Florida up-and-comers features carefully crafted, smartly executed, and reasonably lively garage-rock that finds them sounding comparatively settled since their last LP, 2009's No Seasons.

Forget,Oupa,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a9c0084474cd0c1cb4/1:1/w_160/687ed423.jpg,2011-09-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15765-forget/,Fat PossumBoiled Egg,"Listening to Yuck's debut record from earlier this year, it's hard to imagine a great deal of torment lurking beneath its carefree, youthful veneer. Yuck’s songs, rooted in 1990s slackerisms, mostly coast by on a haze of fuzzy riffs and major keys. But despite those fun vibes there have been hints at another more pensive side to the band, particularly ""Automatic"", a cut released last year under the Yu(c)k banner. That alias has since been fleshed out and given the name Oupa, serving essentially as a side-project for Yuck bandleader Daniel Blumberg. He strikes a different pose on Forget, planting mostly solo piano songs in an orb of bare, sensitive melancholy. At its best, as on the title track, Blumberg shows he has an ear for a big ballad, cutting a tender and compelling figure backed by a sparse, percussive piano. Rather than telling a story, Blumberg uses disconnected snatches like ""I’ll be natural"" and ""She can’t forget me now"" to evoke the feeling of trying to recall a faded memory. The song ends up feeling bigger than its minimal parts, capturing a particular emotion and letting it hang in the air for a few minutes. The problem in the context of the rest of the record is that the particular mood Blumberg captures so well on ""Forget"", or ""Windows"" later on, is repeated over and over on the record and with very little extra instrumentation to hide behind-- save a few electronic touches on ""Waiting for the Car"" and ""New Home""-- the record becomes a bit of a drag. The slightly concealed narratives don't help either; with no big lyrical gut punches the emotional heft feels a bit too vague to really invest yourself in. The 10+ minutes of closing track ""Those Are the Senses"" epitomizes this, starting with a particularly cloying, wet chord progression and an obscured vocal. Those first few minutes are a chore, but the song eventually unravels quite nicely as layers of guitar and delay submerge the vocal and keys. If nothing else Forget allows Blumberg to follow breadcrumb trails he might not get the chance to explore in Yuck, and even though the result is probably too overwrought and serious, it still feels like a worthwhile endeavor. Blumberg is obviously an exciting young songwriter, but it's hard not to feel that there are just too many other people doing the sensitive-songwriter thing in more inventive, resonant ways right now for Oupa to truly stand out on its own.","Following his other group's debut album from earlier this year, Yuck bandleader Daniel Blumberg strikes a different pose with Oupa, planting mostly solo piano songs in an orb of bare, sensitive melancholy.

Young People's Church of the Air,Deleted Scenes,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bc13d197565213a4ef/1:1/w_160/aff6e97f.jpg,2011-09-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15778-deleted-scenes/,Sockets,"On their 2009 debut, Birdseed Shirt, Deleted Scenes demonstrated a light touch with heavy thoughts. The quartet-- split evenly between Washington, D.C. and Brooklyn-- leavened moody tunes about addiction and faith with dreamy sonics and a sweetly self-effacing sense of humor. On the album's redemptive, reverb-drenched climax, ""Get Your Shit Together for the Holidays"", they even managed to pull off some classic Christmas mixtape fare: ""Cheer up, take some medication/ Keep your shit together for a couple days,"" sang songwriter/guitarist Dan Scheuerman, offering warbly comfort to anybody who's had to scrub-up and head back home from a life where things aren’t exactly up to mom’s smell test. Two years later, the follow up, Young People's Church of the Air, proves an even fuzzier-headed happening. It's a lyrically honest but sonically self-conscious record. Scheuerman lays out the bumps and bruises while the band obscures his confessions in a haze of white noise. Everything sounds faded, far away, and lightheaded. But, deep down beneath the digital grot, the album strikes an undeniably redemptive tone. That said, it kicks off with a song about death, the rumbling, double-kick drum driven ""A Litany for Ms. T"". It's a song about making peace with the passing of friends and family off to what is, from Deleted Scenes' perspective, a better place. ""Hallelujah, I'm home,"" Scheuerman wails, just before the song explodes with woozy synthesizer samples in an indie rock approximation of absolution. But the guy who needs the spiritual leg up may be Scheuerman himself. Even more than Birdseed Shirt, Church of the Air struggles with issues surrounding recovery. Drugs-- prescription or recreational-- are woven into the gauzy textures of the music as well as the lyrics. On ""Nassau"", Scheuerman wearily recalls an island vacation, singing, ""Got a long day to recall, the drug deal, the alcohol."" His childhood nostalgia isn't over the counter, either. On ""The Days of Adderall"" he yearns for adolescence, where the ADD medication is conflated with ""dad and mom, certainty."" Though the subject matter is often highly personal, Deleted Scenes never come off self-absorbed. Scheuerman has a gift for distilling complex thoughts into everyday language. The narrative-- be it drugs, god, love, or apocalypse-- is exotic, but comes off universal. On ""A Bunch of People Who Love You Like Crazy"", the narrator ponders a final ultimatum from his family, arriving at the conclusion, ""Nobody here is gonna get your back/ If you turn it down/ They want to see you on the ground."" It’s the album's noisiest turn, the words rendered nearly unrecognizable amidst churning digital distortion. Not all of the material is dour. Many of Church of the Air's most affecting moments are love songs. Scheuerman-- who addresses his then-fiancée, now wife, on “Bedbedbedbedbed""-- approaches intimacy with wide-eyed innocence, rather than syrupy sentimentality. ""Say please what are we gonna be, if it takes five minutes, waste five minutes with me,"" he sings on ""Burglarizing the Deaf"", convincing himself and his significant other to resist over-thinking things. When the community that surrounded Dischord started to fade during the mid 2000s, D.C. hit a transitional moment. Outside of the hardcore and metal scenes, new groups started to look beyond the beltway for sonic cues. And mostly, they looked toward Brooklyn. Deleted Scenes did, too. On Birdseed Shirt it seemed like the beltway was still embedded into their DNA, from the off-kilter approach to rhythm (Q and Not U) to the self-effacing sense of humor and bendy hooks (the Dismemberment Plan). On Church of the Air, the band gets some distance from its hometown-- amping up the atmosphere, playing pitch-shifted guitar arpeggios, and using a heavy-metal double kick to create stuttering rhythms. Sometimes, the heavily affected production of the Spinto Band frontman Nick Krill and longtime producer L. Skell can be off-putting, defusing what would otherwise be big, fist-pump moments. But mostly, Church of the Air squats a unique ground between pop and experimental impulses. It doesn't belong wholly to either world. It's an album that seeks to transcend ugliness, both personal and aural. More often than not, it succeeds on both counts.","The Washington D.C./Brooklyn quartet's sophomore album stakes out a unique ground between pop and experimental impulses, and deep down beneath the digital grot, it strikes an undeniably redemptive tone.

Azari & III,Azari & III,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b6c0084474cd0c1ccc/1:1/w_160/17984b09.jpg,2011-09-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15774-azari-iii/,Loose Lips,"A natural impulse when considering a record like Azari & III's solo debut might be to explain it as the sum of its influences, the individual 1990s club tracks that filled dancefloors in New York, New Jersey, and Chicago, the Steve Silk Hurley and Todd Terry remixes that launched a thousand hips. But Azari & III's music fits in with a contemporary context more readily: They are pastiche artists. Like Hercules and Love Affair, Azari & III have become an album act who are occasional dancefloor producers, incorporating signifiers of a certain era-- in this case, late-1980s and early-90s house and rave music-- and tying them together with a distinctive production aesthetic and saleable personalities. In contrast with Hercules and Love Affair, Azari & III's music moves the timeline forward, stretching into early-90s pop house and shifting the overarching sound from the sparser, restrained mastering of Andy Butler and company into a harsher, big-room aesthetic with a technoid edge. This approach to the past puts them firmly in the lineage of groups like Chromeo. Although the latter deal primarily with vocal-heavy 1980s funk and R&B, Azari & III have a similar sense of lighthearted irreverence balanced with a genuine interest in capturing the fun spirit of the source material, and their enthusiasm for camp can also be a hit or miss proposition. ""Reckless (With Your Love)""-- by far the greatest song Azari & III have produced-- transcends its reference-heavy approach, establishing itself as an anthem for any generation. Its strength is in its contradictions: A muscular groove is at once assertive and vulnerable, a context at once hyper-specific (one can't help but envision the specter of AIDS in its thematic DNA) and universally immediate. Surprisingly, the bulk of the LP moves in a different direction. Rather than focus on pop-house, the group gestures toward the kinds of instrumental house and techno sounds that were big as the 90s began. The most successful of these instrumental moments front-load the LP: ""Tunnel Vision"" has a tense acid-house edge, and ""Indigo"" feels like a euphoric journey into rave past. These tracks emulate the overall vibe of the era effectively, providing a guided tour through some of the music's more interesting aesthetic ideas. The album's more forgettable tracks fill the album's second part: They might have been more effective if they'd lunged for the pop jugular. ""Infiniti""-- a spacey instrumental similar to those rediscovered, recreated, and re-edited throughout the past few years of cosmic disco revival-- does little to leave a mark. The same could be said for ""Change of Heart""'s well-executed dreaminess; it sounds nice while playing, but aside from retaining the overall production aesthetic, it doesn't cohere much. One exception is the maximal industrial cacophony of ""Undecided"", which is a decidedly unique look for the group. Its abrasive ambition recalls some of Basement Jaxx's more kitchen-sink productions. Unlike ""Reckless (With Your Love)"", the group's second big single, ""Hungry for the Power"", shows the weakness of their methodology. There's a comical underpinning to the menace that feels a bit like playing early-90s pop radio dress-up. There's also a bit of an M.C. Escher quality to irreverence for music that was already irreverently dramatic. But it is still a fresh enough aesthetic move to feel novel now, and after the record's weaker second half, it's a refreshing move towards pop immediacy. Really, though, its the earlier track ""Lost in Time"" that best sums up the record's appeal-- on one level, it's about the dancefloor as an escape, while on another, it winks at the group's time travels.","On their full-length debut, these playful house producers solidify themselves as an album act. Here, they take clear references to specific musical eras and tie them together with a distinctive production aesthetic and strong personality.

The Golden Age of Apocalypse,Thundercat,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a1c0084474cd0c1ca2/1:1/w_160/1359c2d2.jpg,2011-09-02 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15758-the-golden-age-of-apocalypse/,Brainfeeder,"As far as debut albums go, the The Golden Age of Apocalypse is definitely a head-spinner, precisely the sort of improbable hybrid from an almost-unknown artist that the Brainfeeder crew has come to specialize in over the last couple years. After all, it's not every day that you find a record that simultaneously recalls the laid-back sprawl of Erykah Badu's Return of the Ankh and the bustling mania of Mouse on Mars' Iaora Tahiti, the slick jazz futurism of Herbie Hancock's Headhunters and the gentle homespun soul of Bill Withers' Just As I Am. This is the sort of densely layered, expertly played, genre-crossing marvel that could easily turn bloated or excessive, or come off like a display of pure skill with little heart behind it. But Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner seems more interested in using his well-honed chops to turn out sunny (if bogglingly detailed) ear-candy than he is in crafting big statements (despite the album's portentous title). Co-produced with Brainfeeder major domo (and Thundercat pal) Flying Lotus, Apocalypse has the digital sheen of many FlyLo productions. But Bruner’s experience as an in-demand rock and soul bassist gives the album a live band's freedom of movement, one that's closer to the fusion records that reared him than the sequenced rhythms that have come to define dance music, even at its most out-there. After a silly and nostalgia-inducing sample from the 1980s cartoon that gave Bruner his pseudonym, ""Daylight"" is the album's true opener, another in Brainfeeder’s line of shouldn't-work-but-does experimental beat confections. It merges the bustling energy of 21st-century left-field electronic music (crunchy mutant techno rhythms, a mix saturated with whimsical sound effects) with the floating-on-a-cloud airiness of 1970s soul (vaporous falsetto vocals, bright-but-wistful melodies). It really does feel like a long lost Mouse on Mars track, as if that most playful of German electronic acts had called up a member of the Soulquarians camp at the same time that Common decided to collaborate with Stereolab. That's all a bit of bait-and-switch, though. There's no doubt plenty of Brainfeeder's psychedelic and IDM-like attention to sonic detail at various points on Apocalypse, along with nods to the fractured rhythms of London's broken beat scene and the earlier West Coast post-rap experimentation of Stones Throw. But like the latter L.A. pioneers, Thundercat takes avant electronic music's futuristic sound-sculpting and reconnects it with the history of African-American pop. He's particularly smitten with that moment in the 70s when soul music got looser and smoother and more electronic, and electric jazz started taming the wildness of improvisation with the slickness and structure of the pop song. Bruner's not beholden to the days of fusion past, of course. He takes detours into smoothly gliding 80s synth-funk (""Walkin'"") and queasy prog ambience (""Mystery Machine [The Golden Age of Apocalypse]""). But still, know that this is more of a jazz album than an electronic music album, and more of a soul album than either. And it's on the third track, ""Fleer Ultra"", that Bruner's true loves finally leaps to the fore, because that's the first time the bass really goes bananas. Bruner is undoubtedly what was once called a ""musician's musician,"" a practice-space hound who reveres good playing. He's unashamed of his talent, but he also knows it's better put to use making hooks. And throughout Apocalypse it's Bruner’s exceptionally fluid bass work that ties together the new millennium computer madness and the cuts that feel like they could have been laid down in the analog days of 1974. Even the drowsiest songs here pop with super-animated basslines. His already justly lauded cover of George Duke’s ""For Love I Come"" turns the tempo of the original down a few notches, letting most the of song play out as an amorphous but silky swirl of electric keyboard and his echo-warped voice-- he makes sure to bring out those bass chops for the climax. As a singer, Bruner is much better than he has to be, considering his musical inventiveness is already plenty attention-grabbing, but while his fluttery, heartsick vocals lend Apocalypse much of its charm and memorability, it's those basslines that are the real earworms. So this isn't really a song album, at least not in the sense that it’ll give rock or even R&B fans looking for verse-chorus-verse much to chew on. As with FlyLo, it's still best to approach Apocalypse as instrumental head-trip, albeit one that's occasionally got tunes you can hum. But like his fusion heroes, Bruner wants it all: the future shock of electronics, the tightly edited pleasures of pop, the love-sick opulence of quiet-storm soul, and the show-stopper instrumental breaks of jazz. The fact that he's mostly pulled it off, with a record that's serious in intent while playful in execution, is pretty astounding.","Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner's densely layered debut (co-produced with Flying Lotus) mixes the future shock of electronics, the tightly edited pleasures of pop, the love-sick opulence of quiet-storm soul, and the show-stopper instrumental breaks of jazz

Simulat,Cosmin TRG,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ba5e6ef95969321ffe/1:1/w_160/a271ef37.jpg,2011-09-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15772-simulat/,50 Weapons,"Cosmin Nicolae committed what for many young electronic producers is a cardinal sin: He changed. Quite a bit, actually: his name (from TRG to Cosmin TRG), his home base (from Romania to Berlin), his label(s), and most notably, his sound. Since 2007, his run of singles for A-list labels like Hessle Audio, Hotflush, Tempa, and Rush Hour has made it impossible to pin him to a specific scene or style. This isn't a sin in and of itself, but amidst the shifting sands of electronic music, it's helpful to have reference points: ""Aphex Twin makes IDM"" is easy to remember, and even if it's only partly true, it's simpler to sort the details out later. Cosmin's constant shapeshifting has made it difficult to identify him with a scene or sound, and his career has seemed diffuse as a result. The first time I heard Nicolae's debut full-length, Simulat, I gave myself a signpost: dubstep. Nicolae's label history warranted the nonchalant tagging, and, moreover, the album's thickly dug bass grooves were what stuck with me. Nicolae, perpetually in motion, is exactly the type of artist who makes these quick-hit bindings unwise. Simulat certainly borrows the rich, tonal bass of dubstep-- as well as its tendency to drift off when not explicitly pushing forward-- but its grooves are more straightforward, shuffling instead of circling, the work of an artist who has internalized the narratives of modern dance without bending to them. Nicolae instead looks to the recent history of Berlin techno-- Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock-- and further back to Detroit-- Robert Hood and especially Richie Hawtin-- for Simulat's roadmap. What this means: linear grooves, prickly synth arpeggios, and sweeping strings/organs or fake-strings/fake-organs. Never a producer of marathon tracks, Nicolae is smart to keep his compositions in the manageable 4-to-5-minute range: Simulat clocks in at a lean, replayable 47 minutes. He stitches it together with moments of meditation and calm, his keyboards seeping through the floorboards to inhabit ghostlier environs and tempos.  I like tracks like ""Want You to Be"" and ""Form Over Function"" most: They offer easy-to-tap rhythms and mallet-simple keyboard thwacks, manageable menace that makes me want to bob and weave in my headphones instead of sinking into them. The album's lead single ""Fizic"" gallops along on the type of UFO-on-cruise-control futurism Juan Atkins pioneered. Nicolae's tracks don't evolve, so much; they arrive, mature quickly, and exit. Simulat is an album concerned with suggested mood instead of sustained groove, but it uses the building blocks of rhythm-- four-on-the-floor drum kicks, bass pulses-- to construct those moods. At his best Nicolae offers the dystopic vistas of techno with an off-center hint of warmth: I've never really wanted to dance to a Plastikman track, but I find it hard to sit still during ""Ritmat""'s tricky home-appliance palpitations. This distinguishes Simulat from a legion of too-serious Berlin techno stalwarts and renders snap judgments about Nicolae's present-- or future-- silly.","The Berlin-based electronic producer's constant shapeshifting has made it difficult to identify him with a scene or sound.

Luminaries & Synastry,Motion Sickness of Time Travel,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b85e6ef95969321ffb/1:1/w_160/6fb2f9cb.jpg,2011-09-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15777-luminaries-synastry/,Digitalis,"Tucked into some remote woods in Georgia, Rachel and Grant Evans have created a kind of mom-and-pop drone factory. Between their duo Quiet Evenings, Grant's Nova Scotian Arms, and Rachel's Motion Sickness of Time Travel, they've spun reams of drone, mostly on small-run cassettes and CD-Rs. Of the three projects, MSOTT leans most toward song-like structures. Though her work is often meditative and abstract, filled with busy synths and widescreen reverb, Evans has a knack for shaping subtle rhythms, slow crescendos, and the wordless phrasings of her own voice. That voice is more prominent than ever before on Luminaries & Synastry, the best MSOTT effort to date. It's not quite right to say Evans' singing is the center of these songs-- each piece is too unified to let any element dominate. But there's something uncanny about the way her voice melts with her drifting tones, as if it's both responding to the music and spawning it. (That effect is mirrored in the fluid visual montages Evans made for ""Day Glow"" and ""Late Day Sun Silhouettes""). Such circular motion produces the feel of a sonic Möbius strip, with each song looping in on itself until time seems to stand still. This illusion of timelessness might suggest that the name Motion Sickness of Time Travel (taken from William Burroughs' novel The Soft Machine) is inappropriate, but in fact it's quite apt. Though her soothing atmospheres are never exactly queasy, Evans' way of making time elastic-- unpredictably stretching and shrinking it-- produces a kind of mesmerizing disorientation. Often it feels like she's re-enacting the fuzzy, time-defying boundary between consciousness and sleep: Drift into her music, and you might feel like you’re drowsily blinking to make out figures in the dark, or waking from a nap-long dream that seemed to last a day. Which might be why, despite being relatively short for drone pieces, the songs on Luminaries & Synastry feel as long and developed as those of any previous MSOTT work. So a track like ""Ascendant"", with its misty tones that cast even dewier shadows, can come as close to infinity in six minutes as, say, Spacemen 3's epic ""An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music"" can in 45. It might seem like a stretch to place MSOTT in such lofty company so soon, but Luminaries & Synastry sounds ready and willing to stand the test of timelessness Evans made for it.","Prolific drone-maker Rachel Evans, aka Motion Sickness of Time Travel, has a knack for shaping subtle rhythms, slow crescendos, and the wordless phrasings of her own voice.

The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night,Case Studies,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a85e6ef95969321fdf/1:1/w_160/82795808.jpg,2011-09-01 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15764-the-world-is-just-a-shape-to-fill-the-night/,Sacred Bones,"What sets The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night apart from a lot of what gets called ""folk"" these days is that it is fiercely unsentimental. But if you gaze back a little further, Jesse Lortz's obsession with pistols, poisons, drownings, and all-consuming spiritual darkness is part of a great tradition; the Anthology of American Folk Music has a notoriously high body count. Even though nobody dies during The Night, it flickers with a constant barrage of unsettling images: knives being sharpened on hearts, blood mixing with saliva mid-kiss, and an address to a lover that begins, ""You lifted up your skirt and took a piss right in the street/ You shook it off your thigh and your eyes said, 'I know you're watching.'"" And that's the love song on the record. None of this macabre humor should come as a huge surprise to those familiar with Lortz's old band the Dutchess and the Duke-- especially if you've seen the video for ""Mary"", at the end of which he and bandmate Kimberly Morrison become rather gleeful-looking cannibals. After the Seattle duo's 2010 break-up, Lortz's first solo effort under the name Case Studies is unremittingly bleak. As far as contemporary kindred spirits go, Lortz's human-sized expressions of cosmic loneliness call to mind Bill Callahan's recent Apocalypse, while his penchant for raw, naturalistic guitar tones evoke the Tallest Man on Earth. Lortz is blessed with neither Callahan's God-sized baritone nor Kristian Matsson's ambulance siren bleat, but what he lacks in an immediately identifiable vocal signature he makes up for with the distinctness of his sparse, evocative songwriting. Right from the start, The Night is a portrait of people's fumbles toward connection. (Spoiler, though all the minor chords provide some clues: they are often totally futile.) Quietly haunting opener ""From the Blade of My Love"" begins with an image of Lortz awake and restless while the girl beside him sleeps contentedly-- the first suggestion of the insurmountable chasm that's sprung up between them. Things go from bad to worse on the terrific post-break-up ballad ""My Silver Hand"", on which he confesses, ""I'd like to still be in your bed/ But I would settle for your life instead,"" with the shattering plaintiveness of somebody who knows that even the lesser of those two things probably won't happen. Beneath Lortz's pleas, a backing female vocalist provides tepid consolation with a few ""la-la-la""s, but she even sounds chillingly distant, as though she's singing from another room. The World is Just a Shape to Fill the Night is preoccupied with both the surface of things and the ugly disorder that lurks beneath them. On ""From the Blade of My Love"", the smoothness of his lover's skin belies the ""war inside raging,"" while the electric twang of ""Lies"" spells out a lengthy itemized list of things you're better off never bothering to ask your lover (""How many days will I love you?"" ""Will I ever hurt you again?"") because the truth deep down ""will only make you cry."" But believe it or not, there's respite-- of sorts. After the slight lag of ""California Ghost Story"", the closer ""The Day We Met""-- a starkly recorded guitar and vocal track-- is a dark and strangely tender love story between two outsiders that ends with this pontification: ""It's the way of the world/ People come, people go/ People mark each other up and sometimes get to love awhile."" Which, coming off the weighty darkness of the previous 10 tracks, doesn't sound like such a bad fate after all. The Night was recorded by Greg Ashley of the psych rock band Gris Gris, and he and Lortz are certainly not the first 21st-century folkies who have tried to conjure the ghosts of Harry Smith's America. But the textured and purposefully naturalistic production on The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night never feels like an affect; it's a fitting sonic reinforcement for the record's musings on detachment, distance and isolation. The Night is a record uncomfortable with all the trappings of the corporeal world-- time, words, its own skin-- and occasionally, improbably, it actually breaks free of them all.","The Dutchess and the Duke's Jesse Lortz strikes out on his own with an unremittingly bleak folk album that calls to mind Bill Callahan and the Tallest Man on Earth.

I'm With You,Red Hot Chili Peppers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a55e6ef95969321fdb/1:1/w_160/33716979.jpg,2011-09-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15761-im-with-you/,Warner Bros.,"I'm With You is a Red Hot Chili Peppers album. No shit, right? It's a point worth repeating because not only is it the most important thing about I'm With You, it's the only important thing about I'm With You. None of the actively recording Peppers-level elite-- not Metallica, not Coldplay, not U2, not Green Day-- have been more consistently and richly rewarded for simply showing up and being themselves. Since Californication kickstarted a second sustained run of monster popularity, the Peppers have not bitterly divided their fanbase over the way their drums were recorded, nor have they gone outside their inner circle for a bold sonic reconstruction. None of their albums were considered kinda hitless duds, and even their samey double-LP wasn't scoffed at as ambitious but more of the same. They've released nearly identical, bittersweet songs about California, sex, and, increasingly, nothing. These songs chart the same and appear on albums that perform nearly identically. All the while, the band continues to sell a ton of copies as the rest of us openly mock Anthony Kiedis (simply by quoting Anthony Kiedis) and find some nice things to say about John Frusciante. But I'm With You is their first record without Frusciante since 1995's turgid, Dave Navarro-helmed One Hot Minute. A former tour understudy for Frusciante, new axeman Josh Klinghoffer blends in with a slightly more textural and less chopsy style, and he thankfully doesn't impose his will on the Peppers like the glam-metal narcissist Navarro did. But in the grand scheme of things, it means nothing. Tremendously dumb lead single ""The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie"" picks up where prior tremendously dumb lead single ""Dani California"" left off-- which is to say, totally within PeppersWorld, a place where an incorporeal female is a prop for Kiedis to drop happy-go-lucky jewels about cockblocking, rockin' like the 1980s, and god knows what else. Over the past decade, the band's had incredible instincts about their choice of singles, the deep cuts rightfully forgotten by all but the dieheards. But while ""Maggie"" is by a large measure the worst thing here, it foreshadows I'm With You's paucity of overtly choice options, ""good Chili Peppers"" and ""bad Chili Peppers"" coming ever closer to a horizon point. More than ever, three extremely talented musicians are all in servitude to Kiedis, the single most irreplaceable frontman in rock history: Seriously, there are plenty of singers who can do a passable Bono or Ozzy or Robert Plant in a pinch, but who's fuckin' with Kiedis' sixteens? Granted, they've never been a source of much food for thought, but at least it worked when the band appeared to be riffing from the reptile brain that craved women, drugs, and party plans, ""uplift mofo"" or otherwise. Here, unless Kiedis is being totally explicit about his subject matter (""Annie Wants a Baby"", ""Police Station""), I'm With You is simply a continuously futile pursuit to figure out what the fuck he's actually talking about. On ""Factory of Faith"", spiritual intransigence is described as such: ""All my life, I was swingin' for the fence/ Always lookin' for the triple/ Never playing good defense."" Then, before you know it, he's quoting Dirk Diggler (""feast on this""). He falls in love with a stripper on ""Look Around"", explaining ""Hustle here/ Hustle there/ Hustle me bitch and you best beware/ It's emotional/ And I told you so."" (This is before Fayetteville-- North Carolina? Arkansas?-- gets a shout out… because it rhymes with ""say it will."") The tricky funk rhythm of ""Ethiopia"" stoically withstands Kiedis singing a scat version of ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"", while on ""Even You Brutus?"" he yawps like David Byrne and courts a young lady by namedropping Steve Miller and Stevie Wonder in the span of fifteen seconds. Thing is, he can shut off that Funky Monk mode in time for the choruses, and if I'm With You proves anything for the Peppers, it's that a one-step solution to making this a better, even enjoyable record is to cut out the verses entirely. Sounds like a good enough idea, but it'd only make it more obvious that they've been writing minor variations of the same exact (admittedly effective) chorus for the past decade: four repeating chords boxing in Kiedis' maxed-out soul croon as Flea and Chad Smith dutifully swing, wondering when they'll finally have a chance to let loose. (When they do during the frenetic coda of ""Brendan's Death Song"", it's a damn revelation.) Some of us will be making “Sir Psycho Sexy” jokes to our grave, but many still have a soft spot for the wild abandon of Blood Sugar Sex Magik because it found space for rock songs that rocked, funk songs that were funky, and ballads that were truly affecting. But they've become so stuck in their Peppers-Mk-II ways that 2006's Stadium Arcadium turned out to be possibly the least adventurous double album ever, and I'm With You does even less to pursue sonic diversity*.* Much of the blame lies with Rick Rubin: As with Stadium and 2002's By the Way, he produces I'm With You entirely without nuance or dynamics. Whether it's the midtempo acoustic ballads (""Brendan's Death Song""), the midtempo piano masher (""Happiness Loves Company""), or the midtempo rockers (nearly everything else), they're all equally loud and flat. As a result, the sequencing of the 14 tracks feels arbitrary, the hour-long runtime intentionally superfluous: It feels as if even they don't think anyone will play this in its intended order after the first listen. As far as arena-dominating radio rock goes, you could do worse: Even as they soften in old age, the Peppers can still remind you that a lot of people discovered Gang of Four, the Minutemen, and George Clinton through them. And occasionally, the punk-funk still rings true: I'd love to see an intrepid mashup junkie lay Luke Jenner's vocals from In the Grace of Your Love over these instrumentals and vice versa. After all, Flea sounded great in Thom Yorke's Atoms For Peace project while actually playing more slap-bass than he does here, and we learned from John Frusciante's troubled but occasionally fascinating solo albums that these guys would probably be far more interesting outside the scope of their main gig. Until then, I'm With You's hip thrusts and gyrations simply go through the motions, the work of a band with all kinds of capital to blow but no incentive to do anything differently. After all, it's a Red Hot Chili Peppers album.","I'm With You, the first Red Hot Chili Peppers album without John Frusciante since the turgid, Dave Navarro-helmed One Hot Minute, is the work of a band with all kinds of capital to blow but no incentive to do anything differently.

Obscurities,Stephin Merritt,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b4ea9e61561daa6676/1:1/w_160/bb573699.jpg,2011-09-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15773-obscurities/,Merge,"Stephin Merritt loves a good concept, most famously 69 Love Songs' teasingly numbered variations on a theme. That 1999 set is justifiably viewed as a watershed-- it brought the Magnetic Fields a much larger audience-- but it's also slightly overrated, unfairly eclipsing his smaller, darker, especially affecting earlier work. Outside 2004's underwhelming ""me""-centric i, Merritt is  strongest when he has precise space limits and when he's applying his volumes of ideas to intimate, less showy canvases. Think of the 10 lonesome road songs populating 1994's excellent The Charm of the Highway Strip. Or, more than a decade later, Distortion's take on Jesus and Mary Chain-style fuzz. His deep baritone was made for the stage, but it does something special when coming quietly through an old cassette player, a crackling turntable, or a pair of well-worn headphones. Plus, the frames aren't always necessary: Merritt's aesthetic is distinctive enough that songs that aren't connected with a conceptual thread still sound like chapters in a larger book-- or, better yet, a diary. See, for instance, Obscurities, the Merge-imprinted collection of odds, ends, side projects, and B-sides. It features material recorded prior to 69 Love Songs-- much of it Merge-associated-- from 1991's Susan Anway-sung synthesized pastoral Distant Plastic Trees to 1995's Get Lost. The compilation is attributed to Merritt, not the Magnetic Fields-- it features work from a variety of monikers (the 6ths, Gothic Archies, Buffalo Rome), and he's the only constant. But the 14 tracks, pulled together from all corners, come together like a lost Magnetic Fields studio album from the early golden era, not an after-the-fact miscellany. Longtime fans will likely be interested in Obscurities for the previously unreleased material. The set has three songs from the Song From Venus era, the unfinished sci-fi musical Merritt was writing with Lemony Snicket (""Forever and a Day"", ""The Song From Venus"", and ""When You're Young and in Love""), a lovely, dour unused 69 Love Songs outtake ""The Sun and the Sea and the Sky"", and the self-described ""heavy metal"" curiosity ""Scream (Till You Make the Scene)"". But it's the old, partially forgotten favorites that give Obscurities its heart. It feels like tracks were selected based on tone and narrative arc, not availability-- they're sequenced by sound rather than year or affiliation. Because memory's imperfect, it's occasionally difficult to tell if you're hearing the original version or a different take, forcing you to pull out those old records and check. The way Obscurities is arranged, you only get two ""new"" songs in a row once, so these ""a-ha"" moments keep popping up, the first via the ambling, Cure-inspired homemade new wave of ""Rats in the Garbage of the Western World"" the B-Side to 1995's ""All the Umbrellas in London"" single. It's followed by the lush, busy 1998 7"" version of ""I Don't Believe You"", a driving track that's recast on i. You also get the quirky kitchen sink ballad ""When I'm Not Looking, You're Not There"" from that same single. Later its the rollicking ""Beach-a-Boop-Boop"", a spry B-Side from Harriet Records' 1993 ""Long Vermont Roads"" single. It's great to hear early Magnetic Fields vocalist Susan Anway emerge from the shadows. She leaves her mark on ""Take Ecstasy With Me"", the classic Merritt love song that closes 1994's Holiday. As far as other singers, we hear Shirley Simms doing an alternate, quieter, less countrified spin on Distant Plastic Trees' ""Plant White Roses"". Merritt sang a version on Merge's 1994 Rows of Teeth compilation, but this take is better. There's also Young Marble Giants' Stuart Moxham on ""Yet Another Girl"", the upbeat, but moody pop song from the 6ths Wasps' Nests. The 6ths are famously known as Merritt's rotating-vocalist project, but he handles things himself on ""Rot in the Sun"", the crooning B-side to 1993's ""Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket"". Obscurities ends with ""You Are Not My Mother and I Want to Go Home"", a song you'll also find on the audio book for Neil Gaiman's horror/fantasy novella Coraline. Merritt later wrote an Off-Broadway musical for the young-adult book, but you're left with a crisper, sharper impression hearing this one swirling, 3-minute bit of outer-space exploration. Obscurities itself is over in less than 40 minutes: It's understated, personal, insular, oddball, and often gorgeous, an unexpectedly coherent collection from an important band.","Though it's a collection of odds, ends, side projects, and B-sides from the pre-69 Love Songs era, Obscurities is surprisingly coherent and also a good reminder of the strength of Stephin Merritt's early songwriting and his ability to get the most out of his rotating cast of vocalists.

Ancient Romans,Sun Araw,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b0c0084474cd0c1cc2/1:1/w_160/ae7547bf.jpg,2011-08-31 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15771-ancient-romans/,Drag CitySun Ark,"Like a sleepless night in an intemperate climate, Sun Araw's undulating edgeless psychmares stick to your clothes and leave chemtrails in your periphery. Ancient Romans, SoCal seeker Cameron Stallones' latest LP under the Sun Araw name, is another fever dream of dub-mottled organ grind and guitar squiggle, at once elemental and futuristic. Romans proves less departure from than refinement of his 2010 breakout On Patrol, a primordially textured slow-going ooze not unlike Excepter doing Earth covers over a skipping disc of Agharta. On Romans, Stallones continues rendering colossal structures in sound, dialing the scale of its predecessor back ever-so-slightly while retaining both its massive scope and its wide-eyed searcher's gaze. With a touch more space between its sinewy guitars, warbly keyboards, and omnitextured bass thump, Romans doesn't immediately inspire the same awe the impossibly grandiose, oppressively humid On Patrol did. Those slowly mutating tunes, even when they tipped in at a quarter-hour, felt almost immaculately composed, each craggy instrument and edge-of-perception toneshift perched against the others just so. Though all of Stallones' music is built around improv, Romans feels a mite looser, more free-flowing than its predecessor, its individual movements less choreographed, its overall mood a bit more relaxed. Yet Stallones maintains his incredible compositional economy and precision; with all its moving parts, Ancient Romans can sound a bit haphazard at first, but each gurgle and whirr works in brilliant tandem, and one more element could tip any of its scales. Romans' sandstorm soundscapes and Afrobeat-indebted underwater funk are panoramic, deliriously detailed visions beamed in from some untapped back-of-the-mind vista. Romans begins slowly, the reedy ""Lucretius"" rolling out like a fog. ""Crown Shell"" matches its dubby bass nausea to flittery desert guitar, with Stallones imparting illegible wisdom over top. What vocals do pop up on Ancient Romans are used to enormous effect; whether it's conspiratorial chants of indoctrination or chants of earthen ecstasy, Stallones' populating of his sound world with these indecipherable characters leaves them feeling at once more alien and more habitable. You can almost make out the very edges of pop song structure in the warped Zapp-and-Fela bootleg of ""Crown Shell"" and the snaky, sunbaked gospel ""Lute and Lyre""; though Stallones' epic-length music resists hurry, it doesn't skimp on form, and even with Romans' somewhat looser feel, he never lets his instrumental wandering take him too far from the compositions. It ends with ""Impluvium"", which flips the trance-like qualities of Araw's eyelid-movie music into something else entirely. Easily the danciest track in Araw's arsenal, ""Impluvium"" knocks, riding a chant-laden, clanky 4/4 groove off into some equatorial sunset. Up against the rest of Romans' slowmo dub-sludge, a track like ""Impluvium"" could well be an overreach, but Stallones' vision for Sun Araw is both so carefully controlled and so wide-- and ""Impluvium"", like everything that precedes it, so roughshod and naturalistic-- the tune becomes like an ideal disembarking point for Romans' steamy night-on-the-river. It's one of Stallones' finest moments to date, yet another reminder that there are few people making music either this all-encompassing or this enveloping. The mighty On Patrol brought together many of the disparate strands in Stallones' work (both as Sun Araw and his stellar Magic Lantern) into a dazzling whole, and though Romans' textures are grittier and its gaze more inward, the ground it surveys isn't too far afield from that of its predecessor. But if Romans is something of a lateral move where innovation's concerned, it's by no means a step down in quality. In the last couple years, Stallones continues to carve out what feels like uncharted territory; hard to blame him for wanting to survey the scenery a little while longer.","Cameron Stallones' latest LP under the Sun Araw name is another fever dream of dub-mottled organ grind and guitar squiggle; at once elemental and futuristic, it's less a departure from than a refinement of his 2010 breakout On Patrol.

Ghost on the Canvas,Glen Campbell,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b39d034d5c69bf48ee/1:1/w_160/9f64d071.jpg,2011-08-31 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15769-ghost-on-the-canvas/,Surfdog,"Recently, Glen Campbell received the kind of diagnosis that everyone of a certain age dreads: Alzheimer's. Before the disease grows worse, he decided to record one final album and launch one final tour, and while most celebrity retirements seem suspect (ahem, Jay-Z, Patrick Wolf, Ryan Adams, and on and on), this one really does feel permanent, which is tragic. Campbell has had one of those impossible careers that sound more like the stuff of outrageous fiction than rock biography: An Arkansas native and music prodigy of sorts, he moved to L.A. and played in a band called the Champs (Tequila!) and worked as a member of the infamous Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians who backed Elvis Presley and Simon & Garfunkel and played on Phil Spector's infamous wall-of-sound recordings. That's him laying down licks on Pet Sounds, while he was a touring Beach Boy. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, he scored huge hits with ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" (both by Jimmy Webb, long overdue for a retrospective). Often dismissed as a practitioner of slick country-pop, he favored florid strings, stately vocals, and an interpretive approach most likely informed by his experience as a sideman. ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" pretty much sums up the contradictions of his music, which is simultaneously country but urbane, slick but still soulful. Perhaps because he was a Nashville outsider but not a Nashville outlaw, Ghost on the Canvas sidesteps all the current conventions of country farewell albums, a growing subgenre that found its apotheosis in Johnny Cash's later recordings and Kris Kristofferson's recent pair of affairs-settling records. This is no tastefully solemn acoustic affair, with a hushed tone communicating a kind of easy-read mortal gravity. Instead, Campbell conveys a certain nostalgia for that defining sound of his prime-- or at least a nostalgia for a time when that sound was popular. ""It's Your Amazing Grace"" and ""A Thousand Lifetimes"" deploy the same tricks he's been using for decades-- those ornate string arrangements and prominent guitar themes that recall fellow Wrecking Crew member Jack Nitzsche-- but they sound fresh on these tracks, even at times adventurous. The short, instrumental interstitials are distracting as Campbell tries to cover every corner of his history, but the the presence of Billy Corgan, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, and all the Dandy Warhols on Ghost suggests that the influence of this style has been, at the very least, broad. Campbell is still taking stock of his life and career (""Sometimes I get confused, Lord/ My past gets in my way""), and that sounds odd only because it's not something he has not historically been inclined to do: He's more renowned as a sensitive vocalist than as a confessional songwriter. So songs like ""A Better Place"" and ""There's No Me… Without You"", both co-penned with producer Julian Raymond, sound perhaps a bit too direct for Campbell, although his voice remains strong enough that he doesn't need your pity to put these songs across, no matter how silly some of their sentiments. Anchoring Ghost is a handful of covers that are perhaps only slightly less adventurous than those on his 2008 album, Meet Glen Campbell. The title track and ""Any Trouble"" are lesser Westerberg, but they fit the album's theme all too well. Likewise, ""Hold on Hope"" is an obvious GBV choice (what, you expected ""Tractor Rape Chain""?), but Campbell owns its schmaltz as well as its simple optimism, suggesting that Bob Pollard wrote the line ""there hides the cowboy"" with Campbell in mind. Ghost is nowhere near his best, most consistent, or most durable album, but that's ultimately not even the right way to measure its modest accomplishment. Instead, it's a surprisingly upbeat retirement album, one that never stoops to self-pity and very modestly reminds you of past triumphs.","Recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, this living legend of pop crafts a final, surprisingly upbeat retirement album, one that never stoops to self-pity and very modestly reminds you of past triumphs. The set includes new songs by Paul Westerberg and Robert Pollard and guest spots from Billy Corgan, the Dandy Warhols, and more.

Fever Dream,Alias,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07613d197565213a48d/1:1/w_160/b2b05997.jpg,2011-08-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15721-fever-dream/,Anticon,"In the late 1990s, the anticon. collective emerged as a unique label dedicated to bursting the boundaries of what could be reasonably considered hip hop: Battle freestyles reconstructed as abstruse beat poetry, hip hop production smeared into ambient drone, rap cadences and phrasings bent to indie folk ends. They were leaders with, at first, few followers. But as anticon.'s own recombinant styles began to calcify-- as Why? became more of a straightforward indie rock band, say, or Themselves increasingly spiraled up their own archly-inflected, hyper-syllabic ass-- the label began to seem less like leaders and more like merely idiosyncratic outliers. Even as one of anticon.'s founding members, Alias has always maintained a decidedly low profile on the adventurous label: just a guy and his drum machines holed up in the home studio in Maine. And that's not only compared to big personality MCs like Doseone or Why?'s Yoni Wolf, but even to other in-house producers, such as the relatively flash, TV Carnage-abetted analog screwball Tobacco. Alias seems to relish a certain hermitic anonymity-- right down to the blank-faced moniker-- and it's an attitude reflected in his beats: moody, introspective tracks whose athletic drumming and melancholy melodies make for heavy head-nodders but that can begin to feel a bit faceless. Latest album Fever Dream aims to disrupt Alias' comfortable patterns as a producer-- the one sheet talks of being ""reborn""-- but it doesn't succeed in making the artist any more familiar, and the change of course feels less like a visionary renewal than it does a well-played catch-up. From the first beat drop, Fever Dream is obviously informed by the vaporized, off-kilter instrumentals of Flying Lotus and likeminded contemporaries: beats shuffle and scatter, bass hits low and leaves space in its wake, samples hiss and dissipate like the air is being sucked out of them, synth lines falter and wobble. This is most true of the album’s opening tracks ""Goinswimmin"" and ""Wanna Let it Go"". Deeper into the album, amidst the adaptation, Alias teases out some of his typically thick grooves and understated but staying melodies-- culminating with the one-two combination of the in-the-pocket acoustic drum break that lights up the latter half of ""Dahorses"" and gives way to the dreamy ""la-di-da"" vocal echoes of ""Lady Lambin'"". Elsewhere, and to lesser effect, Alias calls in fellow anticon. collaborators Why? (whose starring turn in ""Well Water Black"" gave 2008 LP Resurgam an unlikely single) and Subtle's Dax Pierson. The former contributes a stretched, monosyllabic nasal wail to the chunky beat routine of ""Boom Boom Boom"", while Pierson plays keys and sings lead on the bloodless R&B drift of ""Talk in Technicolor"". So, no, Fever Dream's new direction doesn't quite recapture the genre-dissolving days of anticon.'s youth or remake Alias into a soon-to-be household name. It does, however, stand as another fine, frequently very satisfying effort from a dependable producer and deft beat-maker.","On Fever Dream, the adventurous anticon. label's lowest-profile founding member aims to disrupt his comfortable patterns as a producer.

Last King 2: God's Machine,Big K.R.I.T.,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a7c0084474cd0c1cae/1:1/w_160/4f4ba8c7.jpg,2011-08-31 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15763-the-last-king-2-gods-machine/,self-released,"Last King 2: God's Machine bears an unfortunately portentous title for what it delivers: essentially, it's a mixed grab bag of Big K.R.I.T.'s various guest spots over the last year, on a series of iffy-to-forgettable indie rappers' records. It's the first utter non-release K.R.I.T. has allowed his name to touch in a career otherwise built on stringent quality control. His handsome, still-resonant full-length mixtape Return of 4eva came out just last April, and his high-profile Def Jam debut Live From the Underground lies just around the corner. God's Machine adds almost nothing worthwhile to this conversation, except to introduce the first noticeable wobble in what has otherwise been a flawless slow-burn brand-building campaign. Worse, the mixtape presents K.R.I.T. in his weakest, most anonymous light: as a rapper on other people's songs. While he's ferociously talented, K.R.I.T. just isn't the type of rapper to muscle his way aggressively into another rapper's universe: he's best left to himself, where he can settle into a rich background of his own nostalgia-steeped production like sitting back in a rocking chair. God's Machine paints him, unfairly, as just another serviceable, UGK-biting rapper currently clogging up Southern rap-blog feeds. The song choices are mystifying: no one in the world needed to hear K.R.I.T.'s tacked-on verse to Berner's ""Yoko"", rapping alongside Chris Brown, but here it is. No one needed to hear him sharing air time with Cyhi Da Prince. But here that is too (""Hometeam""). There are a few genuine sparklers strewn throughout-- ""Fulla Shit"", a perverse boasting session with Yelawolf and fellow trailer-trash white speed-rapper Rittz, is one of the year's most satisfying rap songs. K.R.I.T. acquits himself admirably while still, lamentably, getting out-shined by the flamboyant personalities flanking him. The same goes for the chunky rap-rock crossover number ""Born on the Block""-- after Killer Mike lays waste to the track, there's not much left for K.R.I.T. to do but show up and stay in the pocket. The humidly bluesy ""The Big Payback"", which opens the mixtape, is the most characteristically K.R.I.T. thing here, consisting of nothing but K.R.I.T.'s agreeably platitudinous raps laid over electric organ and some looped voices. It's over in less than two minutes, but it's the most reassuring reminder of his artistic imprint to be found on God's Machine. On ""The Big Payback"", K.R.I.T. self-importantly reminds us that his name is an acronym for ""King Remembered In Time."" The name doesn't jibe -- there's nothing particularly pharaonic about his presence-- but the touch of self-mythology is a reminder of the fascinating transition K.R.I.T. is undergoing. Over the past year or so, he has been slowly embracing his role as the savior of the conscious-rap underground. It shows signs of suiting him nicely, but the transformation has been fitful: on Return of 4eva, generic country-rap-tune bangers about candy paint and mentions of pimping split time awkwardly with powerful, impassioned treatises like ""Another Naive Individual Glorifying Greed and Encouraging Racism"". The impression was of an artist stranded in uncertainly between the UGK revivalism he started with and the early-era Common figure he might become. A more combustible on-record personality might be able to fuse these strands, but K.R.I.T., an affable, low-key guy, mostly sounds confused. God's Machine feels like a symptom of that confusion, which will hopefully clear up in time for Live From the Underground's main event.","In between this spring's still-resonant mixtape Return of 4eva and his forthcoming Def Jam debut Live From the Underground arrives this mixed grab bag of Big K.R.I.T.'s various guest spots from over the last year.

The Sophtware Slump,Grandaddy,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b079c0084474cd0c1c60/1:1/w_160/3bfe5d14.jpg,2011-08-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15723-the-sophtware-slump/,V2Interscope,"I remember the year 2000. I remember how we called it Y2K, which sounds more like the name of a virus than a year, like something that might make you rethink where you get your meats and produce. I remember a global panic about data that might be lost on computers programmed to interpret years as only two digits instead of four. When we hit 2000, they would just read ""00,"" as if God's finger slipped on the reset button. Ironically (and of course), it was all our fault. But then January 1, 2000 came, and I remember it being like every other day. Some slot machines at a racetrack in Delaware stopped working, and a little after midnight, an alarm at a nuclear power plant in Onagawa, Japan went off in the dark. I remember how in 1999 Grandaddy were like a lot of other decent underdog indie bands that I had an indefensible soft spot for: mopey and withdrawn, with a few mixtape-worthy songs. Then they released The Sophtware Slump in early 2000, and all of a sudden they sounded like they had a particular perspective, a particular substance. Their gift is that they still managed to sound insubstantial. The sadness that sounded like passivity on 1997's Under the Western Freeway turned into philosophy on The Sophtware Slump: nonchalance as a way of isolating yourself from what bothers you. Not that The Sophtware Slump is in any way major-- being major is the work of artistes, and part of Grandaddy's appeal was that they just seemed like low-key guys from central California tooling around in the basement. Most of the album sounds like countryish Neil Young songs coated in synthesizer gloss-- a style that borrows a little of Young's earthy tenderness, a little of Pavement's studied indifference, and a little of the switched-on melancholy of an ELO ballad. They sang about national forests filled with broken appliances and robot friends who woke up drunk in parks. The text on the cover of the CD booklet was spelled out in letters from an old PC keyboard over a grassy meadow with mountains in the background. Flip through to the last page, and you'll see a cowboy walking into the sunset with a Casio under his arm. Basically, The Sophtware Slump is the point where the deflated myth of the American West met the deflated myth of technological salvation. The fear isn't that computers would destroy us, it's that we'd end up living in a futuristic world but still have the same old problems. It's like how David Bowie released ""Space Oddity"" 10 days before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon: Somehow, he knew people would get lonely up there, because people get lonely no matter where they go. If Radiohead captured a feeling of pre-millenial tension, The Sophtware Slump captured the feeling of disappointment that came afterward-- the feeling that life was going to be more or less the same as it had been, only now we'd have to live with the fact that we once thought it'd be so different: the feeling of January 2, 2000. At the time, Grandaddy weren't the only band that played sparkly, cinematic indie music: Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs had come out in 1998, and the Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin came out in 1999. The difference is in both scale and character: Unlike the Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev, Grandaddy were a five-person band that sounded like five people playing together in a room, not five people using the studio to make the sound of a hundred. Even when they use synthesizers to replicate orchestral instruments, it has a miniaturistic quality, like the grandeur of early Hollywood trapped inside a snowglobe. Lyrically, the album is just as contained. Instead of singing about the grand and tearful breakup between man and nature, Jason Lytle sings about wanting to lie down and sleep under a single tree. Fluffy, abstract lyrics like, ""I dream at night of going home some day,"" are grounded by concrete ones: ""Tire scraps on federal roads look like crash-landed crows,"" a metaphor that uses one tactile, breakable thing to describe another. Does the album sound quaint now? Sure. It sounded quaint then, too. Grandaddy's image-- crunchy guys with trucker hats and beards-- was instantly rustic. Their sound was irrelevant. Blowing minds and challenging conventions takes hard work and ego, and Grandaddy never seemed like they had a real capacity for either. But being as essentially easygoing as they are is also what makes all the thematic material here so approachable, if you buy into it at all: Most of the time, it just doesn't sound like they're trying to prove a point-- a sense of modesty that made them feel more seductive and appealing to me than artists who showed up with grand statement in hand. It's funny to me that this album is being given the deluxe reissue treatment only 10 years after first being released, but I guess nostalgia is kicking in sooner these days. Deserter's Songs was reissued recently too, along with records by Sebadoh and Archers of Loaf-- records that don't feel like they were gone all that long. The sound is clearer and better delineated here than it was on the initial release, and the bonus material-- which includes demos and a couple of EPs released around the same time-- is interesting to listen to once or twice but never gives me the feeling that they could've made The Sophtware Slump any more focused and consistent than it is. And sad, too. What a sad, sad album. There's not a happy song on it, really. But there's no angst or despair either, because angst and despair are exhausting emotions. Most of the time, Lytle sounds like the archetypal 90s slacker: observant, slow-moving, dulled by a suburban kind of pain he can't shake. Beck in 1994, without panache or a flair for Art. Beck comes up once, actually, in ""Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)"", a lyric supposedly written by their robot friend, Jed: ""I try to sing it funny like Beck/ But it's bringin' me down."" Cheer up: It didn't get better, but it didn't get much worse, either.","Grandaddy's sad, quaint, low-key Y2K-era classic, which captured the point where the deflated myth of the American West met the deflated myth of technological salvation, gets the deluxe reissue treatment.

Quadruple Single EP,Big Business,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08db1335d7bf169a13a/1:1/w_160/b09aae7d.jpg,2011-08-30 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15740-quadruple-single-ep/,Gold Metal,"When Seattle's Big Business were still a bass-and-drums duo, they seemed like what could've happened if Lightning Bolt decided to become an actual metal band instead of a terrifying parody of one. Like that Providence duo, Big Business made busy music-- the sort of chaotic roiling thunder that can only happen when two expert musicians decide to make as much noise as possible. But unlike Lightning Bolt, Big Business put those gifts in service of burly bellowed hooks and the sorts of hammerhead riffs that would've impressed any high-school parking-lot hessian at any point over the past 40 years. Arriving just after band members Jared Warren and Coady Willis got the call to join Dale Crover as the Melvins' new rhythm section, 2007's Here Come the Waterworks was a piece of larger-than-life fists-up power-rock that would've nevertheless fit in just fine in any of the nation's finer dusty DIY noise-rock warehouses. Since that album, Big Business have doubled their personnel-- one guitarist joined before 2009's Mind the Drift; another jumped on board last year. But on both Mind the Drift and the new Quadruple Single EP, Big Business' mission remained admirably unchanged, its focus squarely on the thudding, juddering roar of that Warren/Willis attack. On Quadruple Single, the guitars seem to be largely extraneous-- tinny squiggles that only take away attention from the primordial scuzz that still anchors the mix. If anything, the new guys seem to be on board for backing-vocal duty more than anything else. And when opener ""Always Never Know When to Quit"" bursts into a gloriously hooky bridge, the extra voices succeed in making an already-huge sound even bigger. On the first three tracks, though, those skyward melodies don't come quite often enough. Like recent tourmates Torche, Big Business know how to balance melody and sludge with aplomb, but sludge and strained time-signature gymnastics win out just a bit too often on the new tracks. It's still perfectly effective fuzz-metal, but it's coming from a group of guys who have done seriously indelible work with the same ingredients, so it comes off a bit too slight. What really redeems the EP, though, is the elementally dumb final track, a platonic-ideal snarl anthem called ""Guns"". The entire lyrical content of ""Guns"" is as follows: ""Guns! Guns! Guns are better than everything else!,"" repeated over and over. If that sounds like a fun goof, it is, but it's also something more. The track starts out as a ferocious martial stomp and builds from there, slapping on layer after layer of scratchy, brutal rock-noise and building into a dizzy roar of directionless animosity. In the right context-- the end of a shitty day, say, when my car stereo is cranked all the way up-- you could convince me that ""Guns"" is the single greatest thing Big Business have ever recorded.","On the Quadruple Single EP, Seattle's Big Business, now a quartet, don't get the melody-to-sludge quotient quite right.

The Glad Birth of Love,Magic Trick,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0af5e6ef95969321ff0/1:1/w_160/88977089.jpg,2011-08-30 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15768-tim-cohen/,Empty Cellar,"Hand it to Tim Cohen: He's got his routine down. Perched high above the streets of San Francisco in the group-house tower that serves as his bedroom and recording studio, the Fresh & Onlys front-man whips off three-chord pop songs with the kind of habitude that normal people reserve for coffee drinking, prayer, and ""Law & Order"" re-runs. With every change in the weather a new set of songs arrives, each collection pressed to limited edition vinyl and packaged in his trademark scary-clown/blood-weeping-eagle artwork. Except, not this time. The Glad Birth of Love breaks the steady solo-record routine that Cohen has established over the last several years. Rather than a smattering of scruffy psych-pop cast-offs, it's a record of long-form suites-- four songs in 45 minutes. The fuzz guitars are, mostly, absent. Another change: It's billed under the name of his live backing band, Magic Trick, rather than his own. In the past, Cohen's solo material has been raw and off the cuff-- a steady stream of downcast sing-alongs jammed out straight to tape and passed on to the world with minimal afterthought. But The Glad Birth of Love is more intricately arranged, slipping from baroque picking to mystical oud-fueled zone-outs. Cohen handles most of the instruments, but there are plenty of guests, including Jonas Reinhardt's Diego Gonzalez (droney stuff), the Sandwiches' Grace Cooper (vocals), and Thee Oh Sees' Jon Dwyer, now the Bay Area's go-to session flautist. Between the multi-movement song cycles and the oboe overdubs, there's more than a hint of prog to The Glad Birth of Love. But Cohen's ambition skews closer to Skip Spence than Rick Wakeman. Though they're ornately embellished, Cohen's epic ballads are basically just a bunch of his regular songs, only strung together stream-of-conciousness style. On ""Clyde""-- a sort of surrealist father-and-son tale-- Cohen keeps the mood mellow, skipping through an endless series of finger style guitar figures, never looking back to a melody or motif once discarded. It peaks in the middle, with Clyde's sea-born demise, where Cohen-- who, despite his stoney demeanor, is strangely accomplished at channeling biblical wrath-- shouts, ""God's great everlasting realm is forever,"" over a single thundering chord. At 13 minutes, album opener ""Cherished One"" is just one really, really, really long love song. In both his solo work and his songs with the Fresh & Onlys, simplicity was key to Cohen's charm. He had a perfect grasp on just how many riffs it took to make a snack-size lo-fi garage rock song sound huge. Even in his solo work, there was always a chorus on the horizon. The Glad Birth of Love throws everything out on the table. It's a summation of Cohen's music-- his psych-rock output, but also the out-folk exercises of his old, unheralded band, Black Fiction. Sing-along moments are scarce, and sometimes the narrative gets foggy. But The Glad Birth of Love's scale gives Cohen room to stretch, letting his weirdo lyrical ambitions run wild amid a jumble of pastoral plucking.","Fresh & Onlys frontman's latest breaks the steady solo-record routine he's established over the last several years with a set of long-form suites.

Outside Society,Patti Smith,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a6ea9e61561daa6666/1:1/w_160/04613da6.jpg,2011-08-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15762-outside-society/,ColumbiaAristaLegacy,"When considered as a cultural figure, Patti Smith is as amazing as they come: an ecstatic poet who turned herself into the bolt connecting New York City's fine art and punk rock scenes in the mid-1970s, and an underground freak who not only scored an enduring pop hit (""Because the Night"", co-written by Bruce Springsteen) but has kept her flag flying well into her sixties. Lou Reed is maybe the only other figure of her kind and caliber, and Smith's a better writer than Reed, at least as far as words without music go. Unlike Reed, though, Smith isn't the kind of pop musician whose work lends itself to anthologizing and cherry-picking. Her one real earlier stab at a retrospective, 2002's Land (1975-2002), got over by supplementing its greatest hits with live stuff, demos, and outtakes-- the interstitial, idiosyncratic material that's a crucial part of Smith's weird gift. But now that she's won a National Book Award for her extraordinary memoir Just Kids, a just-give-us-the-good­-songs-c'mon one-disc thing was apparently called for. Hence this straight-ahead, chronologically arranged collection of singles and standards. Thirteen of its 18 tracks appeared on the greatest-hits half of Land, and two of the others are lead-limbed covers of ""So You Want to Be a Rock N Roll Star"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". As Simon Reynolds points out in Retromania, Smith's declaration that ""I don't fuck much with the past but I fuck plenty with the future"" couldn't have been further from the truth: Very few artists from the punk wave have been so persistently, deeply devoted to a pre-punk idea of rock. (The A-side of her first single was a cover of ""Hey Joe"".) If she has an Achilles' heel as an artist, it's not that she overreaches (she does, but that means she grabs the stars occasionally), it's that she relies too much on what Spinal Tap called ""the majesty of rock, the mystery of roll."" And when you strip away most of Smith's maddening and brilliant experiments, her passionate stumbles and ungainly glories-- when you reduce her to a greatest-hits entity-- what's left is a rock'n'roll throwback that's sturdy but not particularly flexible. She simply isn't a singles artist, ""Because the Night"" and maybe 1988's ""People Have the Power"" (with production that now makes it sound like a cousin of ""Don't You Forget About Me"") notwithstanding. To understand Smith's power, you have to take the tunes and the sprawling poetic gestures together; Horses' ""Free Money"" topples over unless it's got the nine-and-a-half minutes of ""Land"" near it. For Smith's first four albums, Outside Society is an abridgement that doesn't really do her justice. For the six that followed them, it's a salvage job, and not a convincing one (2000's ""Glitter in Their Eyes"" still sounds pretty good, though). If the idea of a great poet fronting a rock band appeals to you, and you've somehow never heard ""Dancing Barefoot"" or ""Gloria"", make haste to do so, and be aware that they initially appeared on better albums than this. But when an artist famously begins her first album by bragging about how the old orthodoxies don't apply to her, it's not entirely surprising that some of her own work doesn't age well.","In the wake of her National Book Award for the memoir Just Kids comes a single-disc compilation that attempts to encapsulate the pioneering punk's sprawling and uneven musical career.

Endless Now,Male Bonding,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09f9d034d5c69bf48d2/1:1/w_160/30b719fa.jpeg,2011-08-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15756-endless-now/,Sub Pop,"From an early age, boys are taught to avoid wearing their hearts on their sleeves. The more you open yourself up, the greater the chance that you'll get yourself hurt. Male Bonding like to explore the tension between TMI and musical aggression. They kick up dust and make a lot of noise but then write of pain, jealousy, depression, and loss. The title of their fine Sub Pop debut, Nothing Hurts, was a succinct summary of their contradictions. It took some time to get the whole picture on Nothing Hurts-- for one, you had to get past the heavy British accents (to say nothing of the album's trashcan production values). The band's songwriter, John Arthur Webb, and co-singer/bassist Kevin Hendrick had problems with speaking up, too, obscuring some of their scattered thoughts. Some have cited this unintelligibility as a telltale sign of Male Bonding's lack of personality; while that's an understandable conclusion to reach, their distance ultimately comes across as a self-defense mechanism-- emotional armor, if you will. Considering the circumstances that surround Male Bonding's second album, Endless Now, you'd assume the stage for this self-hatred and confusion would be a little more well-lit. The record was produced by 1990s-throwback-indie producer du jour John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile) and recorded in Woodstock, New York's Dreamland Recording Studio, a converted 19th-century church. The results are (slightly) more polished, with more room for the band's bashing guitars to stretch their legs. As a songwriter, though, Webb hasn't changed-- if anything, the new sonic spread just provides more hiding places, the dense thickets of melodic hum that drive ""Can't Dream"" and early single ""Bones"" functioning as curtains to sing behind. His cloudy outlook is still noticeable-- despite its title, ""Tame the Sun"" is about not being able to tame the sun-- but it takes some digging through the sheets of noise in ""Bones"" to unearth its futile core: ""Be careful what you dream about/ There's not always ways out."" Lest you think Endless Now sounds like one big pity party, it's not. Nothing Hurts had a big, beating pop heart underneath its scrapes and bruises, and here the hooks are plentiful, to the point where touring guitarist Nathan Hewitt was enlisted to handle the overflow of sweet, sticky stuff. The phrase ""pop-punk"" has been thrown around with these guys, and with good reason (besides those Rivers Cuomo recording sessions, that is); if you took the swaying chorus on ""Seems to Notice Now"" and plunked it in the middle of a pre-misery-and-maturity Blink-182 album, I'm not sure how many would know the difference. A possibly more apt comparison would be Thirteen-era Teenage Fanclub or even vintage Fountains of Wayne in terms of sparkly power-pop goodness, with just a little grit (fittingly, the band's been known to do a cover of FoW's ""Radiation Vibe"" every now and then). Comparisons to such bastions of relative ""uncoolness"" is a surefire way to break out of the ""lo-fi"" holding cell that the band complained to Pitchfork about earlier this year. Although the outgoing sonics of Endless Now represent a considerable leap in sound, it's those same qualities that could very well repel those drawn in by the burnt-ends glory of Nothing Hurts-- not because that previous record is necessarily better, though. It's just... different. And there's nothing wrong with that if you approach Endless Now with an open mind. Bands grow and evolve, and that means shedding some old habits for new ones-- even if they're not ready to drop all of their defense mechanisms just yet.","Recording with John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile), the British punks clean up their sound a bit on their latest Sub Pop LP.

Tha Carter IV,Lil Wayne,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0adea9e61561daa666c/1:1/w_160/6b8fce0f.jpg,2011-08-30 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/,Cash MoneyUniversal MotownYoung Money Entertainment,"A lot of rappers show a lot of love for Lil Wayne on his new album. ""Thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with Tha Carter IV,"" huffs Busta Rhymes. ""It's important that you are more than welcome to Tha Carter IV, and y'all enjoy it,"" advises André 3000. ""Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss,"" reiterates Wayne's fellow ex-con Shyne. And it's Drake who provides the record's most impassioned verse about his mentor's 2010 prison stint for criminal gun possession: ""Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol/ But at least they had some bad bitches workin' in that shit hole."" The man born Dwayne Carter never needed to be propped up like this before. During his Untouchable Era-- from the December 2005 release of Tha Carter II through 2008's Tha Carter III, with several classic mixtapes in between-- Wayne was The Best Rapper Alive because he said he was, and then rhymed his brain off to prove it. He doesn't claim that world-beating title once on Tha Carter IV. And no one else claims it for him. We accepted last year's duo of disappointments-- the aggravated rock turn Rebirth and the unfocused stop-gap collection I Am Not a Human Being-- because they were mere anomalies or appetizers. This summer's Sorry 4 the Wait mixtape was passable, but slight compared to previous off-label bounties like Dedication 2, Da Drought 3, or No Ceilings. So while there hasn't been much recorded evidence to support Wayne's hip-hop supremacy over the last three years, Tha Carter IV was always going to be the true test. As such, it's the rapper's most unfulfilling and worrisome move in a long while. Almost everything about Wayne is relaxed, regurgitated, or regressing here. Most noticeable is his slowed-down flow, perhaps a capitulation to the booming arenas he now plays to regularly, where intelligibility often trumps quick wit. But whereas the only permanent aspect of Wayne's cadence used to be its shiftiness, his delivery has slackened, severely deadening his ferociousness in the process. The falloff is made more apparent by a couple of guest shots from two of rap's most exuberant fast talkers, Busta Rhymes and Kansas City cult hero Tech N9ne. It's as if Wayne dispatched the pair to provide the dexterity he won't (or can't) come up with himself anymore. On ""Interlude"", Tech N9ne and an oddly uncredited André 3000 reel off two of the album's best verses, perfectly setting up its star for a clean-up finale. But Wayne never shows on that track, or the star-studded ""Outro"", as if he'd rather play curator than be the focus of some of the highlights on his own album. His trepidation is understandable considering how Drake and Rick Ross easily overshadow him on recent singles ""She Will"" and ""John"", respectively. In fact, one of Wayne's more spirited moments on the album comes when he forgoes a third verse on ""She Will"" and just hollers and mugs behind Drake's hook instead; he just sounds excited to be in the background. After an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money. Because after you've been ""so motherfuckin' high, I can eat a star,"" as he claimed on Da Drought 3, being ""so high, I get star-struck"" just doesn't pack the same oomph. Elsewhere, he's found a new love for the type of faux-profundity he rarely had time or patience for before. ""I'm searching for today, instead I found tomorrow/ And I put that shit right back like, 'I'll see what I find tomorrow,'"" he blankly philosophizes on ""Nightmares of the Bottom"", itself a downgrade of Tha Carter III's brilliantly soulful ""Let the Beat Build"". Once joyously freewheeling, Tha Carter series has gotten to the point where it comes with its own hip-hop tropes and rules: a combination of East Coast lyricism, West Coast violence, and a distinctly Southern rhythm and flair. That singular formula has served Wayne well in the past, but some of this album's most enjoyable moments do away with it altogether. The squelching T-Pain duet ""How to Hate"" is a paradoxically gorgeous kiss-off that finds the pair heart-worn and a bit pissed. ""She used to always say, fuck my niggas/ And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas, well..."" laments Wayne in a coaxing purr. As usual, T-Pain plays a permanent resident of the friend zone, while Wayne lashes out in the most charming way possible; the track makes you wish the rumored T-Wayne project would actually get off the ground. Even softer is that song's R&B rejoinder, ""How to Love"", Wayne's most mature song to date. And while it's a little jarring to hear the guy behind ""Lollipop"" and so many Gremlins references attempt a legitimate grown-up ballad, the 28 year old's tough love feels earned. Without a fierce beat or screaming guitars backing him, Wayne's sing-rap croak is caught out there on the track, and it results in one of the few Carter IV performances that doesn't sound like a canned retread. Recently, Lil Wayne spoke out on the topic of retirement. ""I want to become a better father and a better man to my woman, and those things take time,"" he told MTV. ""And time takes away from [music]. So the honest answer to that [retirement] question is, I don't know. Maybe so."" Even back in his hallowed heyday, on Dedication 2, he had retirement on his mind. ""My career is my life, so I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping,"" he said in an interlude. ""Hopefully, I'm known for something different-- not different, but known for something else, also."" It's a nice thought. And, after all, this album's uncharacteristic R&B anomalies stand out most. While Tha Carter IV isn't the first indication that Wayne's finest verses are behind him, it is the most glaring. Still, he seems smart enough to know that for every Jay-Z there are scores of rappers-- including several guests on this very album-- trying to relive past glories on a daily basis. Wayne has floated the notion that Tha Carter IV could be his last album. The threat makes sense.","After last year's prison stint-- not to mention the disappointing rock experiment Rebirth and various underwhelming stop-gap releases-- Lil Wayne finally attempts to reassert his hip-hop supremacy with Tha Carter IV.

Figure It Out,PS I Love You,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09713d197565213a4c2/1:1/w_160/a58651b2.jpg,2011-08-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15750-figure-it-out/,Paper Bag,"Some may deem it premature for a band whose debut album isn't even a year old to be releasing a B-sides/rarities compilation this early in its career. But it's important to remember that PS I Love You essentially began life as a B-side: tucked away on the back half of a split 7"" with Diamond Rings' ""All Yr Songs"", PS I Love You's heart- and-face-melter ""Facelove"" proved to be every bit as affecting and addictive as its more celebrated A-side, and the heretofore unknown Kingston, Ontario, indie rock duo subsequently parlayed that momentum into a well-received full-length album (2010's Meet Me at the Muster Station) and a non-stop international touring itinerary. So the hasty appearance of Figure It Out represents more than just a stop-gap measure to maintain visibility in an increasingly crowded playing field; more than most bands, PS I Love You understand how a B-side can pave the way to the A-list, and how thin the line is between a forgotten song and a fondly remembered one. The purpose of Figure It Out is ultimately two-fold: Its first side shines a light on the band's pre-Muster Station origins, while the second brings us up to date on what the band has been up to since the album's release. Though singer/guitarist Paul Saulnier and drummer Benjamin Nelson had previously played together in a Kingston quartet called Magic Jordan, PS I Love You initially began as Saulnier's one-man project, and the five solo demos collected here-- pulled from a CD-R sold at early shows-- stands in stark contrast to the boisterous noise-pop jams heard on Muster. On click-tracked confections like ""Subtle and Majestic"" and ""Actually (I Am a Monster Now)"", Saulnier plays with a delicacy that suggests he's being extra careful not to wake up his neighbors, laying off his distortion pedal and singing in an uncharacteristically soft tremble, while the Neil Youngian acoustic ditty ""Notes and Stuff"" suggests a few dues paid at coffeehouse open-mic nights. We also hear skeletal, drum-machined versions of two future Muster Station standards, which are ultimately more interesting as historical artifacts than stand-alone tracks-- though the instrumental arrangements for ""Facelove"" and ""Scattered"" are more or less mapped out already, you can hear Saulnier stretching the limits of his one-man-band set-up, and begging for a more bombastic treatment that he just can't achieve on his own. Side two brings us back to familiar, present-tense territory. PS I Love You confidently navigate the spectrum from the ridiculous to the righteous, shifting between the endearingly stoopid Pixies karaoke of ""Starfield"" (which celebrates what is presumably the ultimate sci-fi geek fantasy of ""fuck-fuck-fucking on the back of a flying space lion"") and the gleaming, majestic Diamond Rings collaboration ""Leftovers"". In tandem, these songs reinforce what PS I Love You do so well: They handle the silly and serious stuff with equal conviction and drown them both in so much volume and distortion that you're not sure which side they're playing on anymore. Figure It Out's two cover selections may seem unlikely, but they adhere to the same fuzzy logic. On a sandblasted makeover of Madonna's ""Where's the Party"" Saulnier yelps out the chorus with the creepy suggestiveness of someone who's probably been blocked from the Facebook invitation list. And though Rush's stern-faced, suburban-outcast portrait ""Subdivisions"" fits right into PS I Love You's thematic wheelhouse, their reasonably faithful version actually works best as a comedic exercise in how freakin' hard it is to cover a Rush song-- Saulnier and Nelson variously leave out certain changes altogether or add in extra bars as if they needed more time to catch their breath. Though Figure It Out's title is taken from ""Starfield"", its sentiment rings most true here: Saulnier and Nelson know they're no Alex Lifeson or Neil Peart, but as their career up to this point has shown, they sure know how to make the most of their limited means.","This early-career rarities comp from the Ontario band serves two purposes: Its first side shines a light on the band's pre-Muster Station origins, while the second brings us up to date on what the band has been up to since that album's release.

Lounge Lizards EP,Purling Hiss,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0955e6ef95969321fbc/1:1/w_160/f2507a08.jpg,2011-08-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15748-lounge-lizards-ep/,Mexican Summer,"Mike Polizze, the man behind Purling Hiss, has tapped into a trashy aesthetic that's part of rock'n'roll's DNA. He's got introspective druggy tunes and riff-heavy party songs, both of which romanticize the brilliance of a burnout. But that's not Polizze: He's a Philadelphia friend of Kurt Vile's-- he played guitar on the Childish Prodigy tour-- who started out in Birds of Maya and made scuzzy rock records as Purling Hiss for Permanent and Woodsist before putting out this EP on Mexican Summer. But ""burnout"" is as good a word as any to convey his brand of rock grit, which is slathered in cruddy production and with a hard emphasis on shredding. Lounge Lizards' six tracks serve as a logical follow up to the sound and feel of last year's Public Service Announcement, which was also a meeting of catchy hooks and awful production quality. Of course, the sound is presumably intentional and serves a few purposes on the EP: it dampen screams, accents enormous guitar solos, adds density to an already dark song, and muffles instruments' sounds so they bleed together. The effect defines Purling Hiss' sound. This time around, the production doesn't completely warp the tuning in the middle of a song like it did on Public Service Announcement; instead, he opts to make everything sound vaguely smothered. Just past the muffled noise, there are some bold, well-executed tunes. ""The Hoodoo"" serves as the instant earworm of the record, offering a power chord-driven hook, a far-away percussion stomp, a note-perfect guitar solo, and a stupidly catchy and simple melody of dudes singing ""HOODOO!"" between verses. On ""Karaoke Nite"", beneath completely unintelligible vocals, you can hear the muddy shouts of ""whoo whoo"" reminiscent of the ones on the Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and a fluidly harmonizing guitar. There are dozens of well thought-out, off the cuff, immediately catchy elements like this on Lounge Lizards, and it's clear Polizze has become more than adept at crafting great rock songs. There's also a lot in the way of mood-- like in the heavy, deliberately paced trudge of ""Voices"", a track that finds Polizze stoned and hearing voices in his head. He's not frantic or frightened-- he delivers the song with a lazy whine, which pushes forward one brand of actual, not-stereotypical stoner paranoia (""I don't want to be alone/ Don't want to be stoned""). Meanwhile ""City Special"" lets Polizze stretch out into doomier territory. He still throws dynamic guitar accents into the mix, but keeps most of the elements to a drone. Sometimes Polizze gets overindulgent. On ""Midnight Man"", he offers an urgent riff and what sounds like an army of metalheads shout-singing, ""I am the midnight man."" And while the intimidation comes through, it wears thin halfway into the track. Ultimately, it's a shortcoming that's easy to overlook when it's sandwiched between two high-flying guitar monsters like ""The Hoodoo"" and ""Been Teased"". And really, ""Midnight Man"", both literally in track placement and in its ominous lyrical mantra, is the centerpiece of the burnout savant aesthetic that Lounge Lizards pushes. If you're stoned and hooked on a groove, sometimes you just keep going.","Mike Polizze, the man behind Purling Hiss, has tapped into a trashy aesthetic that's part of rock'n'roll's DNA. Here, the Kurt Vile associate from Philadelphia burrows deeper into warped, scuzzy rock'n'roll and late-night burnout introspection.

Tassili,Tinariwen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ac5e6ef95969321fe8/1:1/w_160/fda5901a.jpg,2011-08-29 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15767-tassili/,Anti-,"In southeastern Algeria, there is a vast plateau set aside as a national park called Tassili N'Ajjer. It's close to the border with Libya, and years ago, in the 1980s and early 90s, it was a place of relatively safe passage for Kel Tamashek fighters moving between the refugee camps in Libya and the battlefront in northern Mali. To look at it in satellite images, you might think you were looking at he surface of some distant moon, long ago scarred by geologic activity but now barren and strangely beautiful. It wasn't always this way. Thousands of ancient cave and rock paintings dating from 8,000 to around 1,700 years ago depict a place of plenty that slowly dried to become the modern desert. There are lost religions and civilizations out there. The Tassili N'Ajjer covers some 45,000 square miles. Near the southern rim of the plateau is a town called Djanet, and it's out in the rocky desert near this town that Tinariwen chose to record its fifth album. The group would have preferred to record near its homebase, Tessalit, in northern Mali, but the security situation was too precarious. The re-flaring of a conflict the group hoped was put to bed clouds some of the album they made-- the first couplet on the album, sung in weary Tamashek by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, translates to, ""What have you got to say, my friends, about this painful time we're living through?"" It's not only about the new conflict, though. From there, the song calls out to people who have given up the nomadic life of the desert, lamenting that they've left but seeming to understand why they have. These complex emotions run through the album, and the predominant feeling that comes out of them is longing, for home, for peace, for old friends, for a way of life whose place in the modern world is uncertain. Tinariwen have mostly put aside their electric guitars for this album and returned to the acoustics they first played together, backing the rhythmic playing with small hand drums and clapping. They've invited in a few friends as well. Nels Cline contributes a beautiful wash of ambient guitar to opener ""Imidiwan ma Tennam"", two members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band add rough, sonorous texture to ""Ya Messinagh"", and TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe, who traveled out to the desert recording site, are on hand on five songs, adding subtle backing harmonies and even a bit of lead vocal on one song. The invitation of outsiders into the songs is in one sense a measure of the confidence the band has in the integrity and singularity of its sound, and also a reflection of where they've been recently. Tinariwen has toured the world and will be in North America again this fall. Some of the longing for the desert in these songs undoubtedly stems from the band's travel schedule, and when Alhabib asks others why they left, he may in part be doing it to remind himself that it's worth the challenge of staying. Meanwhile, Tassili is a very different album from any Tinariwen have recorded before, and they're proving to be a band of considerable range as they build a catalog of varied and excellent albums. Only time will tell where they're able to record the next one, but their retreat to the Tassili seems to have left them creatively refreshed.","The Malian desert guitar band changes things up with acoustic instrumentation and guest spots from Nels Cline and members of TV on the Radio.

The R.E.D. Album,The Game,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a29d034d5c69bf48db/1:1/w_160/ead2fa64.jpg,2011-08-29 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15759-the-red-album/,DGCInterscope,"When Game got himself kicked out of G-Unit in 2005, he effectively became a ward of the record industry. He existed, so somebody needed to take care of him. That responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Interscope/Geffen tandem, who, like bad foster parents, decided to remedy their problems with him by throwing unseemly amounts of money in his direction. In theory it might make sense, as Game's career has long been based on a simple formula: Surround him with artists more talented and famous than him, provide him with an envious selection of beats, then get out of the way and hope for the best. Up until about 2009, you could actually tack ""profit"" onto the end of that list, but the last few years haven't been too kind to rap's foremost tragic clown. Game last released an album three years ago, and like The R.E.D. Album, it seemed destined to be a commercial failure. But along came ""My Life"", a Lil Wayne collaboration that became Game's biggest hit since 2005, and so the project, and his career, were salvaged. But that was a time when pretty much anything Wayne touched ended up making somebody some money, unless you were Brisco or Cassie. It was the Lil Wayne Feature Bubble of 2008, and unfortunately for Interscope, Game has turned out to be Pets.com. The R.E.D. Album arrives in stores as a monument to the twisted logic and dire business practices of the modern rap industry. It has cycled through as many ""lead singles"" as the total number of radio hits that Biggie had in his whole career (yes, including posthumous releases). Its Wikipedia page could almost be printed and published as a 33 1/3 book. At a mere 21 tracks long, and featuring 17 different artists, the final product is one speedboat away from being a DJ Khaled album. Guests include Drake, Young Jeezy, Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne twice, Dr. Dre five times, and Nelly Furtado, who must've wandered into the wrong recording studio and froze up like George Costanza when she tried to find an excuse to leave. It's almost as if the rap and R&B world got together to do a benefit album, although considering the state of Game's career, that might not be too far off. On one side of the coin is a work that's an utter monstrosity, and whose best moments appear very sporadically. The other side is an album that is almost-- almost-- too big to fail. Where some collaborations here feel like the result of Game spinning a prize wheel and taking his stuffed Lloyd, ""Heavy Artillery"" (featuring Ross and Beanie Sigel) and ""Speakers on Blast"" (with Big Boi and E-40) sound like they were conceived with consideration to how the artists might sound together and how the tracks would fit into Game's gritty aesthetic. In what might be the album's two greatest successes, ""Martians vs. Goblins"" finds Game putting on a worthy audition for Odd Future (complete with a hilarious Lil B crack) and ""Drug Test"" rides a beat that thrillingly turns the clock back to when G-Unit wasn't merely an investment firm. The perverse thing about The R.E.D. Album is that amidst this unsightly storm of star power is the backbone of what could've been a coherent album. A number of tracks lean on soulful production that provides an appropriate (though maybe too on-the-nose) backdrop for Game's hyper-personal verses. Others dip into storytelling or flesh out a bit of Game's personal history. At the very worst the album wouldn't feel like one of those fake leaks that haphazardly packages together an artists' singles and random features into one large .rar file. But of course, Game's whole career is based on the hypothesis that he can't sell records on name or talent alone. So instead, the album smothers itself in R&B choruses sung by people like Chris Brown and Mario, and nobody wants to hear that, including, surely, Chris Brown and Mario. The R.E.D. Album will likely fade into obscurity immediately upon arrival, but if it doesn't raise some eyebrows around major label offices, then this is a failure of not just one person, but also of an entire industry. As Watch the Throne lords over the genre, its antithesis is here: a strategically and artistically directionless album, built around a desperate, forgotten MC, foisted upon a public that has made it very clear that it wants nothing to do with him. Game told MTV's Shaheem Reid that the album's title referred to his re-dedication to hip-hop but, in a taunting, delicious bit of irony, it more appropriately reflects the project's balance sheet. We can pretend the album never existed, or better yet, joke about it for years to come. Jimmy Iovine, on the other hand, isn't so lucky.","After many delays, Game returns with an utter mess of an LP, one heavy on guests (Drake, Rick Ross, Tyler, the Creator) and light on inspiration.

Wander / Wonder,Balam Acab,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ab9d034d5c69bf48e8/1:1/w_160/fd8586da.jpg,2011-08-29 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15766-wander-wonder/,Tri Angle,"The rapid emergence of micro-genres has a long history in music, but the Internet has intensified the process. Online communication creates a situation where young artists, separated by geography but brought together through the web, can share the same obsessions and quickly develop remarkably similar aesthetics. The umbrella of music sometimes called witch house is perhaps the most obvious example of this in the last few years, since it combined musical concerns (moody synths, slow tempos, warped vocals, allusions to Southern rap) with a specific visual aesthetic (anonymous producers shielded by hoodies, Christian imagery, deep knowledge of the computer keyboard's symbol keys), and so many artists with these exact qualities appeared simultaneously. Unusually, the bulk of the movement could be traced to precisely one source, Salem, demonstrating how much sway that sometimes reviled outfit had over the minds of budding young producers who spend way too much time online. Once a scene or sound crystalizes, you can bet that the most interesting artists to emerge from it will quickly set off on their own and develop an individual voice. Balam Acab, the project of 20-year-old Pennsylvanian Alec Koone, was rightly slotted with witch house when he released his See Birds EP in 2010. He has the warped voices and the slow tempos, he was on the right label, and his IRL identity had a cultivated air of mystery. But the careful construction of See Birds hinted that his musical ear was a cut above, and now his excellent full-length debut, Wander / Wonder, confirms it. This is a personal and distinctive record with its share of current reference points that nonetheless doesn't need a scene to prop it up. A few things set Balam Acab apart from the pack, first being the overall mood. The post-Salem ""dark and creepy"" crawl became a cliché in record time, but Wander / Wonder, despite the spectral voices that take the lead on every track, has no hints of nightmares or grim violence. Instead, its primary concern is simple aesthetic beauty, the way a small and specific combination of sounds, carefully arranged but given room to breathe, can have a deep emotional impact. It's pretty, in other words, but its prettiness never feels manipulative or overbearing. It's the sort of music that exists at the intersection between art and design, but it manages to avoid feeling sterile. There are eight tracks here in 37 minutes, the perfect length given the consistent mood. They have vague titles like ""Apart"" and ""Now Time"" and ""Oh, Why"" that serve as a light tint but don't really point to anything in particular. In fact, differentiating between the tracks seems sort of beside the point, since so many of the same motifs pop up over and over again: The album feels very much like one sustained thing. The basic elements are twinkly keyboards and music-box chimes, dusty crackles floating on sounds of shifting liquid, and deep basslines bumping into the occasional drum machine clap. Floating above it all are the voices, pitched up to accentuate their delicacy and set loose in a cloud of echo. While the current vogue is for sampled vocals that allude to R&B, Balam Acab's mostly have a classical feel, sounding like they are pulled from recordings of ancient hymns and airs. Accentuating the ""chamber dub"" qualities are liberal samples of orchestral sections and nylon string guitar. But the most important instrument of all is silence, which frames every note and brings it to the foreground. Where the ghostly dubstep of Burial, an obvious antecedent, has a crucial connection to the urban street, Wander / Wonder is pastoral, more likely to bring to mind sunlight slanting through a window that overlooks a rural garden. And you can't have a garden without water. As anyone who has ever knocked over a cup next to a computer knows, water is the digital sphere's mortal enemy, the thing that can bring our precious electrical circuits down in an instant. In line with recent productions by Clams Casino and AraabMuzik, Wander / Wonder has has an obsession with the sound of the life force: Laced throughout are samples of lapping currents, slow drips, and light splashes. These accents reinforce both the bucolic feel and, with the complexity of the natural world that computers still envy, liberates the music from the computer grid. They also make Wander / Wonder an immersive experience, like something you lower yourself into, inch by inch. And in the end, that seems to be the overriding idea: This is functional music that highlights the simple pleasure of artfully arranged sound, the kind of gorgeous and evocative record that fills up the room and shifts your perception for 37 minutes and then brings you gently back to the surface.","Balam Acab, the project of 20-year-old Pennsylvanian Alec Koone, was slotted with witch house when he released his See Birds EP in 2010. Here, his primary concern is simple aesthetic beauty, the way a small and specific combination of sounds, carefully arranged but given room to breathe, can have a deep emotional impact.

Through Donkey Jaw,Amen Dunes,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a413d197565213a4d5/1:1/w_160/e7f0f49b.jpg,2011-08-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15760-through-donkey-jaw/,Sacred Bones,"Most of what I said about Damon McMahon's last album as Amen Dunes, 2009's DIA, can be said about his newest, Through Donkey Jaw. He's still making muffled, eerie pop akin to the private visions of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence and the homemade pop of New Zealand artisans Alastair Galbraith and Graeme Jefferies. His voice is still central, filled with downbeat subtlety, and his songs still mix classic melody and fuzzy obscurity in a way that's both focused and loosely inspired. There's something different about Through Donkey Jaw, though. Its 14 songs are sharper and fuller, with quicker access to your brain's pleasure center. The simple explanation would be that McMahon formed a band upon moving back to America from China after the release of DIA, which would iikely make his songs sound bigger. But my guess is his improvement comes from something even simpler-- just by keeping at it, McMahon naturally got better at what he already did well. Whatever the reason, Through Donkey Jaw's forward steps are apparent immediately on hypnotic opener ""Baba Yaga"". Over a trembling guitar line and primitive drumming, McMahon moves gradually from a solemn moan to a possessed croon. ""You know that I, I lie,"" he howls, as if he's not so much admitting this to someone as figuring it out himself. Similar introspection recurs throughout the record. ""I don't knock on no doors/ I'm quietly shared/ I'm for people who know,"" he chants on ""Christopher"", over a wash of beat and reverb that's like a tangent to the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". A classic group that Through Donkey Jaw evokes even more often is the Velvet Underground. (The album ends with a 10-minute song actually called ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", but its wordless noise is more like a VU jam than the Beatles' original). There are a few specific instances to point to-- ""Gem Head"" sounds like a bedroom-recorded version of ""Run Run Run""-- but where McMahon most connects with the VU is in using repetitive rhythms and raw edges to turn hooks into mantras. Take ""Jill"", a shimmering jam that's somehow catchy, even when he closes with the desperate chant, ""I don't want to give in."" Again, introspection is key; McMahon catches your brain by inspecting his own. Think of Through Donkey Jaw as an out sound from deep within.","After the release of 2009's DIA, Damon McMahon returned to America from China and formed a band, resulting in a fuller sound on his latest.

I Am an Attic,Nick Diamonds,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09a13d197565213a4c9/1:1/w_160/6f50cb99.jpg,2011-08-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15752-i-am-an-attic/,self-released,"Nick Diamonds never takes a break. He started out fronting the psych-pop the Unicorns, moved on to the more ambitious and less combustible Islands, and then came Th' Corn Gangg, his much maligned hip-hop project. After that, we received records from side projects including Reefer and Human Highway. At the moment he's headlining for Mister Heavenly, a recently announced supergroup that also includes members of Modest Mouse and Man Man, and Diamonds just released I Am an Attic, a solo album, by way of his Bandcamp page for a price of your choosing. While it doesn't come with the pre-packaged, stylistic framework of, say, Human Highway (read: Young, Neil; 1970s folk and country), I Am An Attic does scan like pure Diamonds: whether he's trafficking in serpentine guitar licks or screwballing sound effects and synths, there's an unmistakable sneer to it all. That said, you're also hearing him here at his most muted and still, which doesn't make for as compelling a listen as that might promise on paper. This is an unusually reined-in record, one whose spartan arrangements tend to register more as scraps or free-floating ruminations than exercises in restraint. Take opener ""Attic"", with its plumes of Theremin, crystalline guitar work, croaked-up vocals, lightly-applied layers of keys and synth: It all seems to appear and then dissolve in just two very forgettable minutes. Diamonds, as it turns out, is most effective when spontaneous. Here, he's sleepwalking. When he does work up some energy, the results are terrific. ""You Must Be Choking"" is an at-times majestic and unsettling highlight that, despite cribbing the vocal melody from ""Silent Night"", does well by working in a few unexpected jolts of volume. ""Used to Be Funny"" flirts with a ""Stairway to Heaven"" reference before erupting into a stormy mess of industrial oompah. Interestingly, the recording quality throughout is quite good, forsaking the sort of raw, flash-fried (see also: lo-fi) qualities that you might expect from a potentially free solo record. And though closer ""Fade Out"" plays to its title, what's there is ripe: a set of high-arching guitar melodies fan out over a creamy organ track, a sprinkling of bells that mirror at times the sound of Diamond harmonizing with himself. It sounds like an idea that could segue into something great.","The busy collaborator and frontman (Mister Heavenly, Human Highway, Islands, etc.) steps out with a low-key pay-what-you-want solo album.

Coastal Grooves,Blood Orange,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07813d197565213a490/1:1/w_160/de401e3e.jpg,2011-08-26 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15722-coastal-grooves/,Domino,"As a member of short-lived dance punks Test Icicles, Dev Hynes abused eardrums and EQ levels with glee. Since that group's demise, he's flashed surprising proclivities towards lush, orchestral-tinged folk-pop in the vein of Okkervil River with his solo project Lightspeed Champion. There have been growing pains at every step along the way, but they were always the result of Hynes admirably trying to do too much, trying to pour too many words and ideas and emotions into his compositions. So it's a real shock listening to Coastal Grooves, the debut LP released under Hynes' newest solo moniker, Blood Orange. Coastal Grooves is all about what's missing-- it's a highly stylish album that frequently forgoes things like melodies, energy, and vocal choruses in favor of slinky, solitary guitar lines and seductively spare, post-punk atmospherics. Most of the album's 10 tracks feel like promising skeletal demos of songs that are close to being truly great. Hynes is a gifted and voracious guitarist, displaying here particular predilections for sounds from Asia and the American West. Aside from a couple of purely moody pieces (""Can We Go Inside Now"", ""Complete Failure""), Coastal Grooves is also largely propelled by strong, strutting rhythmic foundations, while Hynes' vocals remain appealingly florid throughout. The problem is there are almost no payoffs. Far too often, Hynes lays intriguing groundwork for a sexy, indie-funk jam or a sweetly kissed pop song, arrives at the chorus, and gives us only a stark guitar line or plinky little rhythm. I suppose this minimalist approach is in keeping with the album's artfully space-conscious post-punk leanings, and sometimes the device is evocative (particularly on first single ""Sutphin Boulevard""), but it gets to a point with Coastal Grooves that you halfway start expecting to hear Hynes mumble, ""Chorus goes here,"" during some of the seemingly placeholding moments. Subsequently, the few songs that have genuine vocal refrains-- like ""Forget It"" and ""The Complete Knock""-- end up feeling more fleshed out and dynamic than they really are. Hynes is the type of demonstrative, emotionally engaging artist who definitely feels more at home being messily overambitious than coolly restrained. The sounds he pursues here as Blood Orange might be more hip than his work as Lightspeed Champion, but the end results are less satisfying. Ideally, a blend of the two styles would be best, the artfulness of one project with the human connection of the other. So which sounds better: Blood Champion, or Lightspeed Orange?","Dev Hynes follows Test Icicles and Lightspeed Champion with a new solo project, a highly stylish album that frequently forgoes things like melodies, energy, and vocal choruses in favor of slinky, solitary guitar lines and seductively spare, post-punk atmospherics.

You Are All I See,Active Child,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0929d034d5c69bf48be/1:1/w_160/1a31db4f.jpg,2011-08-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15745-you-are-all-i-see/,Vagrant,"Though no sound suits every taste, the harp has to be one of the most inoffensive instruments in existence, which is why we aren't greeted in heaven by angels with marimbas. Active Child's Pat Grossi makes free with the harp's transfiguring power on his new album, and it's not the only thing stacking the deck in his favor. You Are All I See is full of stuff that almost everybody likes, or seems to, right now: epic electronic landscapes, monastically minimal R&B, and currents of rumbling post-dubstep sound design. Grossi's strong yet ethereal voice-- its corners neatly squared by a childhood spent in choirs-- masses and hovers, imparting an elevated piety to the music. The slick, timely aesthetic is appealing, but works at slight odds with the timelessness Grossi cultivates. If you enjoyed how harps and beats entwined in a glittery haze on Active Child's Curtis Lane EP, you'll enjoy You Are All I See, which is similar but runs on finer gears. The EP's fairly rigid boundary between dance numbers and atmospheric ones has become much more porous, creating a subtler flow that carries us smoothly from the frosty soul and coiled percussion of ""Hanging On"" to the expansive art-pop of ""High Priestess"" and ""See Thru Eyes"", where jagged but spare synthetic drums and holographic tone colors make Grossi's voice seem to tower even higher. It all sounds like the work of someone whose computer expertise is catching up with his instrumental chops. With this welcome refinement of style comes a minor downside, namely, that it feels overly familiar. This isn't to say that Grossi is ripping anyone off-- at a time when music is so instantly responsive to its own immediate context, his recombinant approach is routine. But on You Are All I See, craft edges out personality. The allusions to modern trends are so well-realized that it at least creates a slightly numbing impression of opportunistic pastiche, even if the similarities were unintentional. If you enjoyed the experimental soft-pop moods of Bon Iver's recent album and are looking for more spiritually glamorous music, step right up. Pacesetter How to Dress Well, who mines a vein similar to Grossi's but more ghostly, guests on the excellent ""Playing House"", while ""Hanging On"" sounds like a heartfelt synthesis of ""Lady Luck"", ""The Boy Is Mine"", and ""Pony"". To top it off, ""Way Too Fast"" and ""Shield & Sword"" both have the prayerful, hollowed out turbulence of James Blake. With a figurative dugout like that, it's hard to go wrong in 2011. Nothing wrong with a low-stakes success if it sounds this good. But it's odd when a record that puts such a high premium on the personal feels so formal and emotionally opaque. Grossi's lyrics about longing and engulfing isolation have been polished to the point where they are immaculately vague, and sometimes, precious. They project plenty of emotional grandiosity. What's missed are more specific details, which might have led to something more relatable. As it stands, the sound of Grossi's voice is much more eloquent and moving than his words. Taken together, You Are All I See still can't help but feel like an old cathedral-- easy to admire in awe, but somehow cold and remote; hard to really make your own.","Following on the Curtis Lane EP, the Denver-based singer and producer releases his full-length debut, and it mixes ethereal choir-like vocals and minimal R&B with currents of rumbling post-dubstep.

XXX,Danny Brown,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09cea9e61561daa6656/1:1/w_160/2393785c.jpg,2011-08-26 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/,Fool’s Gold,"Danny Brown is a Detroit rapper with a strangled yap of a voice that you could politely call ""distinctive."" Depending on the moment, he either resembles a Doberman whose paw has been stepped on or a cross between Jello Biafra and South Park's Terrence & Philip. For a rapper, choosing an abrasive honk like this as your instrument is an audacious move; it all but demands that you come well-equipped with compelling reasons for your listeners to hang on. But Danny Brown is an unusually audacious rapper. He proudly rocks skinny jeans that, to hear him tell it, cost him a G-Unit label deal all by themselves, and he has lately settled on the kind of wildly asymmetrical haircut that can invite savage beatings in certain areas. He belongs, in other words, to a proud lineage of mangy underground-rap weirdos. There are many rappers vying to claim this spot, but none of them is as talented or as three-dimensional as Brown, and his latest mixtape, XXX, finds him transforming his quirks and jagged edges into a compelling and immersive universe. That universe is haunted by drugs, both sold and consumed. XXX's grubby production, laced with trashy electro, evokes a heart-pounding clamminess that will feel instantly familiar to anyone who's weathered a spiky high on cheap stimulants. Brown's voice is uniquely suited to conveying wild-eyed, loose-cannon insanity, and the rising note of panic in it makes every mention of snorting crushed Adderall hurt. To hear him tell it, he is a Hoover for illegal substances; on ""Die Like a Rock Star"", he catalogs the various undignified ends he expects to meet, invoking Keith Moon, Jimi Hendrix, and others and leering, ""Experimented so much it's a miracle I'm livin'."" His penchant for depravity might remind listeners, at least initially, of Odd Future. But Brown's depravity, unlike OF's, comes burdened with real-life stakes; at age 30 (the mixtape's title indicates Brown's age besides suggesting sex and drugs), Brown has lived through some genuinely awful-sounding shit. On ""Scrap or Die"", he flips the chorus of Jeezy's ""Trap or Die"" so that it becomes about stripping houses for scrap metal to sell to factories. He takes a perverse joy in grabbing your neck and shoving your face in some vividly unpleasant places: ""I done served fiends on they menstrual/ Ain't even had pads, stuff they panties with tissue!"" he yelps on ""Monopoly"". His shock rhymes on XXX are like horrorcore stripped of cartoon fantasy, and they carry the moral weight of experience. On ""Pac Blood"", he calls his lyrics ""shit so personal my mom can't listen to,"" and you believe him. If XXX was nothing but debauchery and desperation, it would quickly devolve into an endless slog. Thankfully, Brown is also hilariously funny, an endlessly inventive rapper driven to cook up outrageous variations on standard rap boasts. At one point, he claims to be getting as much pussy as Teen Wolf-era Michael J. Fox; at another, he brags he can ""get pussy like loofahs."" On ""Adderall Admiral"", he tells a rapper he is ""softer than Flanders' son."" In a recent interview with writer Andrew Nosnitsky of Cocaine Blunts, he revealed himself as an omnivorous rap nerd, the kind of guy who went through heavy No Limit and Def Jux phases, and his palpable joy in his craft is infectious. ""Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head,"" he raps on the title track, sounding astonished and grateful. His gleeful love of words not only elevates some pretty heavy subject matter; it also helps distinguish XXX as one of the most compelling indie rap releases in an already strong year.","The audacious Detroit rapper with a strangled voice and a penchant for depravity transforms his jagged edges into a compelling and immersive universe.

Still Living,Ganglians,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09e9d034d5c69bf48cf/1:1/w_160/fc7d692d.jpg,2011-08-25 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15755-still-living/,LefseSouterrain Transmissions,"Sactown janglers Ganglians conceived Still Living, their nearly hour-long third LP, as something of a clearinghouse. Working, as they put it, ""with no metronome,"" they went into the Still Living sessions to stretch out their limber melodies, tamp down their nervous energies, and wipe away some of the murk of their earlier work. That they did; the airy Still Living brings their gently unfurling, sunlit melodies and towering blasts of harmony into sharp focus. Still Living's cross-section of Byrdsian folk-psych, loose-limbed 80s indie rock, and fizzy Beach Boys-derived harmonies in the nouveau Grizzly Bear/Fleet Foxes mold finds the quietly confident Ganglians nimbly folding in one sliver of melody after another until their songs just glimmer. With an album's worth of agile tunes at their disposal and Dirty Projectors associate Robby Moncrieff behind the boards, Still Living slips by with an elegant ease that seemed beyond them even on their two fine 2009 efforts. For all its musical poise, Still Living stumbles right out of the gate and-- vocally, anyway-- occasionally struggles to regain its footing. ""This is a sad sad song for all you sad sad people,"" Ryan Grubbs lets go at the album's onset, and this overeager announcement proves memorable in all the ways they didn't intend. What follows is, thankfully, a tad subtler, as Grubbs' lyrics recede more often than they pop, often buried in a sea of enunciation-divebombing harmony. Ganglians aren't alone in their fondness for the swelling, Beach Boys-derived vocal pileup, as filtered through the aforementioned animal bands. They're fine enough singers, but after a while, Still Living's reliance on ornate vocal kumbayas seem to weigh down its willowy music. The chorus of ""whoah-oh-ohs"" that sets off ""Jungle"" is close kin to Fleet Foxes' ""Ragged Wood"", and ""Evil Weave"" isn't the only number that breaks into a round; lovely stuff, but brought out this frequently, the distinctions between songs-- and, occasionally, syllables-- begin to blur But if you can accuse Ganglians of anything after Still Living's opening salvo, it's drowning in their own loveliness; not the worst problem to have, really. Though they may nick liberally from fairly familiar sources-- the clear-eyed but slightly sneaky melodies of the Feelies, R.E.M., and Galaxie 500, ornate symphonic-pop vocalisms of past and present greats, and an indie-popper's low-key mentality-- their crosshatching of influences has enough finesse to make easy comparisons seem beside the point. Ornate but never ostentatious, Moncrieff's production brings clarity and fluidity to the proceedings; even the occasional overreach does better on coherence than their earlier, more scattershot stuff. Even Still Living's wealth of straight-up guitar-pop isn't quite so straight-up after a handful of listens, the bends in the road ahead becoming clear as day after a few passes. Though they could still stand to pull back on the vocal fanfares, brushing away some of the gunk that mottled up their earlier records and doubling down on melody each open up new avenues in their sound, and Still Living finds Ganglians delivering on their early promise while stepping confidently toward whatever's next.","Sactown janglers Ganglians conceived Still Living, their nearly hour-long third LP, as something of a clearinghouse.

The Ornament,Gold Leaves,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0915e6ef95969321fb7/1:1/w_160/e4205cf8.jpg,2011-08-25 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15744-the-ornament/,Hardly Art,"Even if you don't know Grant Olsen by name, there's a good chance you've heard his voice. In 2007, Olsen and fellow Seattle resident Sonya Wescott released In Camera as Arthur & Yu. The pair took cues from a narrow set of influences-- the Velvet Underground's drowsy pop-leaning moments, the sunglasses-cool work of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra-- but the results felt full and well executed. Four years later, Arthur & Yu seem to be on a hiatus, and Olsen's got a new gig: the hearty folk-pop project Gold Leaves, who, like A&Y before it, is releasing its debut LP, The Ornament, on the increasingly reliable Sub Pop offshoot Hardly Art. The label affiliation provides the opportunity for a family affair, as Papercuts frontman Jason Quever lent a hand with production and instrumental flourishes. As a result, the record carries shades of Quever's own distant, faded brand of indie pop-- only, Olsen's compositions sound rounder and warmer than anything Papercuts have ever released. The fact that the album opens with the immense, elliptical ""The Silver Lining"" only hints at the full-bellied heat contained on the rest of the record. In Camera was a charming effort, but also a relatively small-sounding one; The Ornament is the exact opposite, with melodies that stretch across highways and drums so hollow you could live within them. The Ornament's expansiveness owes a fair bit to Olsen's voice, which sounds like it's been given an emotional B12 shot. His lyrics are prettily-- albeit somewhat emptily-- evocative, richly textured, and his tonal pronunciation (the ""PO-lice cars"" of ""Hanging Window"") adds temporal sentimentality to his words. Any narcotized simplicity Olsen previously possessed as a vocalist is basically over and done: Honestly, he may have one of the most flat-out pretty voices in contemporary indie rock. Granted, the field for strong vocals in today's indie isn't exactly a crowded one, although the above descriptions will likely remind many of another certain Sub Pop-signed bearded belter (hint: rhymes with ""Bobbin Plecknold""). Like Fleet Foxes, Gold Leaves are doing nothing new-- this sound is comfortably familiar, like a rocking chair or stretch of well-trodden road. It's remarkable how well Olsen wears this new sound, though, to the point that the few cuts that reach back to his days in Arthur & Yu (""Honeymoon"", ""The Companion"") can't help but feel slight by comparison. But there's a twist, as the swaying throb of ""Honeymoon"" yields a single sentiment besting the emotional distance of Olsen's previous work, repeated like a mantra: ""Come back to me."" Take it how you will-- me, I'm hoping it means we won't have to wait so long to hear from him again.","Arthur & Yu crooner Grant Olsen has a new folk-rock project featuring assistance from Papercuts frontman Jason Quever.

West,Wooden Shjips,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06eb1335d7bf169a0fe/1:1/w_160/f8135346.jpg,2011-08-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15714-west/,Thrill Jockey,"When you're reading about San Francisco space-rockers Wooden Shjips, certain other bands' names come up over and over again: the Stooges, Suicide, Hawkwind, Spacemen 3. On a certain level, that's inevitable. There's nothing new about what Wooden Shjips do, and we can hear the quotation marks in the band's music even if they didn't intend to put them there. All the bands named above, in one way or another, made visceral, forbidding rock that drew much of its power through stretching-to-infinity repetition. When I hear it, another name springs to mind: Lungfish, if the great Baltimore astral-punk band had made music for the Camaro-cruising goons in Dazed and Confused (and if they'd had a way less distinctive singer, but that's another story). Wooden Shjips turn the crunchy choogle of 1970s boogie-rock into isolation-chamber space-out fare. When it connects, that's a powerful formula, though it's still a formula. For a band that thrives on eternal repetition, Wooden Shjips have made some impressive strides toward approachability from album to album, and West is by far their biggest leap yet. On previous records, the band would be content to ride a single chord long enough to turn your brain into goo. But the tracks on West are comparatively compact (the longest top out around seven minutes), and they often come equipped with riffs and melodies that don't sound too terribly far-removed from classic-rock radio fare. The recording itself is warmer and cleaner than anything they've done. Most of the songs blast off into glorious solos near the end. I'm pretty sure I heard a tambourine on at least one song. In short, it's the first Wooden Shjips record that your stoner uncle might not hate. Still, the band is very much doing what it does on West. Even with its increased focus on classic-rock virtues, the album isn't really a collection of riffs and wails and choruses; it's more a muscular sort of vibe-out-- badass ambient music, if you will. As hard as the band can rock, expansive nod-out music is still its focus, and the album works best when you give yourself over entirely to its pounding grandeur. Frontman Ripley Johnson sings in a narcoleptic mutter that never displays the slightest bit of feeling, and his numbed monotone never disturbs the mood by leaping out of the mix to grab you. The band deserves credit for sticking to the simple purity of its own sound, but its music seems unlikely to cause the sort of life-changing epiphanies sometimes created by those bands I listed in the first paragraph. In a perfect world, the album might end with ""Flight"", its best and longest track, a deep fuzzed-out groove with a nagging organ line that builds to a cathartic guitar-solo flare-up. It's the track that most perfectly exemplifies the band's sound, and it works well enough to leave you dazed by the time it's over. But the album keeps going for two more songs-- the relatively sprightly ""Looking Out"" and the vaguely puzzling ""Rising"". Now, I'm not sure if all of ""Rising"" is played backward or if it's just the vocals and the drums. I'm guessing it's probably the whole thing. It's like the band challenged itself, not by varying its usual zone-out style but by seeing if it could achieve that same effect when the tape machine is running backward. And the weird thing is that they basically get there. ""Rising"" is by no means the best song on the album, but it won't cause you to jump up and turn it off when it comes on, either. So that's Wooden Shjips for you: a band more inclined to come by its signature sound through ridiculous means than to switch up that sound more than a little bit.","Wooden Shjips turn the crunchy choogle of 1970s boogie-rock into isolation-chamber space-out fare.

Hearts,I Break Horses,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09313d197565213a4b8/1:1/w_160/02142f03.jpg,2011-08-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15747-hearts/,Bella Union,"I Break Horses' name tells me they listen to Smog. Their debut LP, Hearts, does not. Late-period Smog-- and, by extension, Bill Callahan's solo albums-- are often built upon earthy instrumentation, understated vocals, emotional stoicism, and a wry sense of humor. All of these qualities are absent from Hearts. On Hearts, the Swedish duo of Maria Lindén and Fredrick Balck immerse themselves in homemade shoegaze, the kind that's made by computers for computers. It's an approach and sound that's crossed language barriers for the past 20 or so years as bands strive to approximate Loveless without the benefit of a label they can bankrupt in the process. The form had something of a rebirth with M83's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts: At the time of its release, the beauty the album achieved with seemingly cheap synths felt shockingly novel. As Matt LeMay wrote: by 2003 ""a gorgeous wall of melodic guitar noise just [didn't] seem so impressive anymore."" I Break Horses can do this sort of pretty, and you'll view Hearts as frustrating or effortlessly pleasing depending on your ability to see doing only ""pretty"" as an admirable endgame. However, the album's first two tracks do provide a legitimately thrilling and visceral experience. Opener ""Winter Beats"" fades in on a trebly arpeggio that spins like an LED pinwheel over sustained, 8-bit major chords: Until Lindén's heavy-lidded vocals enter, it's nearly a chiptune revival. Soon thereafter we get the anticipatory thwack of the first synth snare-- the part, toward the end, where it locks into a near-double-time beat. That, coupled with an echo of MBV's glide guitar, add up to an emulation of controlled flight that has me thinking of how roller coasters work on an elemental level, how meticulously engineers leave no hairpin turn or stomach-rattling drop to chance. It's a marvel of aerodynamic design. The title track, on the other hand, has more of a pulsating build, one that's no less overwhelming, Lindén and Balck swathing themselves in sumptuous sonic fabrics only to tear it all apart. It's not entirely without precedent-- in addition to Dead Cities, there's the lo-fi abstraction of 4-track dream-pop projects like Astrobrite or the points on Fuck Buttons' Tarot Sport where the catharsis of noise and rave dovetailed. For about nine minutes, I Break Horses achieve a similarly fanged beauty. Then there's the moment where ""Hearts"" fades out and ""Wired"" introduces itself with a guitar entirely shorn of processing. ""Wired""'s hardly a bum track-- it's got something of a roadhouse blues bump that's every bit as surprising as the sudden pitch-shifting that warps the final minute-- but it is a turning point. The rest of Hearts simply swims with the current using a kind of aerobicized take on shoegaze that streamlines the sawtooths into soft curves, and merges emotional polarity into a constant and generally pleasant buzz. It's music you might hear in a CB2 furniture store-- languorous and luxurious in tempos and tone, but without any sort of sentiment outside of the swooning used to implant the idea in your brain that you might have sex or do drugs on that reasonably priced but fashionable couch. Lyrics rarely mean anything in this realm, but you can take titles like ""I Kill Your Love, Baby"", ""Pulse"", and ""Empty Bottles"" as guidelines. And, as if echoing the album title, a near-constant kick drum thump serves as a sonic equivalent of the heart at the center of these songs, tracks that pump steadily without being upset by much. The snare rattles that punctuate ""Cancer"" gives the impression that it's on the verge of some sort of breakthrough, but not enough tension builds to take it there. Later, as closer ""No Way Outro"" starts to ramp itself up with a minute of regal drum rolls, Hearts just fades out. I'd hate to think that I Break Horses' capacity for magic is contained completely within their distortion pedals, but ""Winter Beats"" and ""Hearts"" sound marooned from the majority of the record, sort of like a pair of oddly placed remixes (as well as cruel reminders of heights never again achieved). Really, considering the majority of Hearts' unbothered lushness, I Break Horses' adoption of the name of one of Smog's most intense songs doesn't seem quite right. Judging from the material we get after those first two tracks, ""Butterflies Drowned in Wine"" would've been a more appropriate way to show their appreciation.","Swedish duo I Break Horses immerse themselves in homemade shoegaze, the kind that's made by computers for computers. It's an approach and sound that's crossed language barriers for the past 20 or so years as bands strive to approximate Loveless without the benefit of a label they can bankrupt in the process.

Thursday,The Weeknd,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09db1335d7bf169a14d/1:1/w_160/b539ffde.jpg,2011-08-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/,self-released,"It sounds a bit ridiculous to say that the Weeknd avoid the sophomore slump with Thursday, given that the Toronto crew's first release arrived just five months ago. But not many artists, especially in the Internet era, show up with such a well-developed aesthetic (a very foggy, of-the-moment variation on mainstream radio's slow jams) and something as self-assured as the House of Balloons mixtape. And those that do probably don't have a Drake co-sign and such a carefully managed cloak of anonymity. Months later, all we really know about the Weeknd is that there's a singer named Abel Tesfaye with an earthy The-Dream-like voice and a lecherous persona that's both repellent and compelling. We've seen a few smoky, black and white photos disseminated via Tumblr that perfectly fit the music's bad vibes; there have been a couple of live dates; and apparently, the project has two associated producers helping to craft a sprawling, drugged-up R&B sound: Doc McKinney, best known for Esthero's Breath From Another and another guy named Illangelo. Beyond that and a handful of ""unofficial"" but suspiciously high-budget videos, we have the music on these two mixtapes. Though there's less breathing space on Thursday, and fewer melodic hooks, it still feels of a piece with House of Balloons. There's the same ineffably skeezy vibe and a genuine sense of the album-as-journey, brought upon by smart sequencing and Tesfaye's willingness to complicate his devilish, drug-addled Lothario persona. The production is slightly harsher and streaked with violence, befitting the lyrical content-- ""Life of the Party"", the best and most disturbing song here, is based around doom-like guitar riffs that suggest something truly terrible about to happen. The guitars burst forth during Tesfaye's mocking chorus (""you're the life of the party""), sung as he casually convinces a girl into a group-sex situation. Other songs are tinged with similarly abrasive sounds: drill'n'bass noises rattle around in the background of opening track ""Lonely Star""; ""Rolling Stone"" begins with a blustery chunk of heavily processed guitar; and the final track, ""Heaven or Las Vegas"" (not a Cocteau Twins cover) features a late-song interruption by screeching effects and heavy echo. For contrast , the only jarring touch to the production on the fairly one-note House of Balloons is the title track's Siouxsie and the Banshees sample. So the world here, in addition to being more sonically varied, feels just a little darker and a little more dangerous. Oh yeah-- and Drake shows up on this one. He delivers an end-of-song verse on ""The Zone"", very much in his ""I'm on One"" mode. Which means he's full of confidence and rapping in a manner that lurches forward and then slows-up, teasing his melodic, every-dude croon but never giving into those R&B impulses. The Weeknd and Drake have been linked for a while now, first through a series of blog and Twitter co-signs and now as proper collaborators, so it's interesting to finally hear the superstar step into this far more debauched world. Surprisingly, he remains himself, talking about not having fun at a strip club (""Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole"") and later on, advising a groupie to ""be you."" Even when Drake seemingly stumbles into an encounter in which he does indeed, fuck ""your girlfriend,"" he isn't devilishly smiling about it, and there's no question of consent as there often is on many of the Weeknd's drug-fueled seduction songs. The introduction of anything resembling an ethical point of view is jarring and underlines the stark differences between these collaborators. Drake gets mileage out of being conflicted and in over his head, while Tesfaye sings from the perspective of an unabashed creep who doesn't care what people think, and waits for the moment when everything's at a tipping point and people's guards are down. Part of the odd appeal to the Weeknd's music is that by spending this much time with a predator, the vulnerable inconsistencies in an image trying hard to armor itself with coke, pills, and cynicism start to show through. Repeating the days of the week on ""Thursday"" slowly comes off as pretty pathetic, even a tad OCD, and ""Gone"", a hypnotic, purposefully stagnant epic, feels a lot like being at a party near a guy content to tell you how fucked up he is, over and over again. The gorgeous ""Rolling Stone"" contains meta references to Tesfaye ""smoking til' [he] can't hit another note"" and concerns that his mystery is fading. It's almost sympathetic, though it's just as likely that this is some new, more nefarious form of seduction by way of self-deprecation; after all, the last words crooned on the album are, ""I am God."" When Thursday comes to an end, you have to wonder where the Weeknd go from here. This is the danger of anonymity and telling of the way Internet hype programs our cheapest impulses: We're ready to ask about the next thing before this other thing, even though it's quite good and rewarding, has come to an end. The Weeknd, however, know what they're doing, and so, in a few months, another new release, Echoes of Silence, is due to arrive, and our strange, dysfunctional relationship with their damaged R&B will start all over again.","The drugged-up R&B project returns with its second free album, picking up where House of Balloons left off and adding some new twists. There's the same ineffably skeezy vibe and a genuine sense of the album-as-journey, and the production is slightly harsher and streaked with violence, befitting the lyrical content.

Don't Act Like You Don't Care,Luke Temple,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07db1335d7bf169a11c/1:1/w_160/52a2b3ec.jpg,2011-08-24 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15726-dont-act-like-you-dont-care/,Western Vinyl,"This is sort of complicated, so try to follow along. Before Luke Temple self-recorded his murky, self-sampledelic 2009 debut as Here We Go Magic (the only release from the project thus far that features Temple all by his lonesome), he made two solo albums that mixed chamber-pop experimentation and singer/songwriter fare: 2005's Hold a Match for a Gasoline World and 2007's Snowbeast. While he was recording Here We Go Magic, he simultaneously made another solo album with a few friends helping him out, including future Here We Go Magic member Michael Bloch and Glass Ghost's Eliot Krimsky. When Here We Go Magic started gaining steam and turned into a full-band/full-time concern, Temple shelved the results, Don't Act Like You Don't Care, until the present day. An early working title for the album was The Country Record, and that title speaks volumes. The majority of Don't Act Like You Don't Care is comprised of uncomplicated ditties, both jangly (""Ophelia"") and bummed out (""So Long, So Long""). Temple experimented plenty on Gasoline World (Snowbeast, too); there are fewer risks taken overall here, which makes the record a fascinating window into an alternate-- and, to me, not totally desirable-- route his music could have taken had Here We Go Magic not attracted attention in the first place. It's especially likely that listeners approaching this album are the ones who were initially ensnared by HWGM's increased profile; for them, potential (albeit minor) revelations are in store. Although Here We Go Magic's fleshed-out second album, last year's Pigeons, was far from the gestation period at the time of this LP's recording, you can pick out strands of that album's wooly, gently weird genetic code in the mutant folk of ""More Than Muscle"" and the unsettling twists and turns of ""Weekend Warrior"". Don't Act's sparse closing track, ""Luck Part"", slowly opens up with dark ambience and swaying unease. It'd be interesting to hear how these tracks would sound as played by Temple and his band now; they certainly fit in with his latest gig's M.O. Don't Act Like You Don't Care is enjoyable but fails in key respects. It's poorly sequenced-- sprightly cuts up front with the slow, samey stuff crammed in the rear-- and the four-tracked production means that a decent amount of the material sounds like it never quite made it past the ""basement demo"" phase. In the three years since the recording of this album, Temple's made considerable leaps as a songwriter; a bit of present-day woodshedding would have likely benefited this material, which was recorded in a pair of four-hour sessions. Instead, this odd and intermittently pleasurable artifact just kinda sits there, an unintentional rebuke to the artist that orphaned this poor thing.","While he was recording his debut as Here We Go Magic, Luke Temple simultaneously made another solo album with a few friends helping him out, including future Here We Go Magic member Michael Bloch and Glass Ghost's Eliot Krimsky.

Wigry,MIMEO,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08cc0084474cd0c1c7d/1:1/w_160/2749d6f0.jpg,2011-08-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15741-wigry/,BôłtMonotype,"MIMEO is an acronym for Music in Movement Electronic Orchestra, but the name also brings to mind the obsolete duplication machine known as the mimeograph, responsible for so many blurry copies of grade-school tests and local newsletters. It's an apt image, because Wigry, like any live album, is at best an approximation of the original event it attempts to reproduce. The performance that lead to this recording looks particularly impressive. The dozen-strong European ensemble performed this music in a church in Poland, with each member given a separate loudspeaker and seated beside each other across a long table. Participants include AMM guitarist Keith Rowe, IDM pioneer Christian Fennesz, Dutch improviser Gert Jan-Prins, Editions Mego founder Peter Rehberg (aka Pita), British electronic wizard Kaffe Matthews, and drone maestro Rafael Toral. Despite the busy schedules of the members' individual pursuits, this group has somehow worked together for 13 years, and the double-LP Wigry is their seventh release. Which probably explains why, even though the album consists of four side-long, presumably uncut pieces, very little here sounds like unfamiliar artists forced to grope and grasp at ways to listen and respond to each other. That's not to say that every second is compelling. But the tones and moods are remarkably consistent, even when the activity lulls or the sounds are unsurprising. Perhaps the church's natural acoustics left an indelible stamp; if so, the musicians take good advantage of that, trusting that their actions will become interactions via the glue of the surroundings. Whatever the cause, all the sounds echo and bounce with an unfailing blue-grey hue, so that when the sparse cricket-chirp halfway through side three crests into a wall of hum, you can hear the original sonic raindrops inside the gathering storm. There are some other identifiable crescendos spread around the album's four sides, but what makes Wigry most interesting is also what might frustrate some listeners. Sometimes the group's progress seems oddly arc-less, lacking in discernible momentum. Yet even when the album feels static, everything remains drenched in atmosphere and texture, like a storm cloud frozen in the sky. To me, MIMEO are best when they make motion feel like stasis and vice versa, and that paradox takes hold quite often here. But even if that part of the experience seems too abstract, simply getting to wet your head with Wigry's misty ambiance makes it worth a dip.","MIMEO is an acronym for Music in Movement Electronic Orchestra, and here the long-running experimental supergroup featuring Keith Rowe, Christian Fennesz, Rafael Toral, and more creates abstract improvisations in a Polish church.

"Ugly Buildings, Whores & Politicians: Greatest Hits 1998-2009",Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M.

It's a remarkable song, hard-headed and unsentimental, and singer-songwriter Patterson Hood sings his throat ragged to convey Smalley's mortal fear as well as his mortal defiance. ""The Living Bubba"" is more about the musician than the music, so the Truckers play those last notes almost reluctantly, as if only the song were keeping Smalley alive. As an opener, it signals both the high stakes in the band's output as well as the general subject of Ugly Buildings, Whores & Politicians: These are songs about the dedication, determination, integrity, and stubbornness it takes to be in a hard-working, hard-touring band. If the Truckers were at all cynical, or if their songs lectured about their subjects, Ugly Buildings would be unbearable. But any lessons they impart in songs like ""Carl Perkins' Cadillac"" (about label/artist relations) or ""Outfit"" (about fatherly advice) sound more like notes to themselves-- milemarkers on what Hood might call ""the righteous path""-- and allow this collection to cohere into something more than a career retrospective. While the tracklist seems too short at a mere 16 songs, Ugly Buildings still attests to the breadth of the band's music, which ranges in style from gritty rock to Southern soul and ranges in subject from racial politics to recession worries (""The Righteous Path"" may be the best song ever written about class distinctions). Their catalog is unique in American music, an almost literary endeavor with none of the pretensions such a description might entail. They give voice to the losers, tragic heroes, and everymen beaten down by hard circumstances, allowing each character his or her dignity. Most yuk-and-pluck alt-country bands of the 1990s would have approached a song like ""Bulldozers & Dirt"" from 1999's Pizza Deliverance with a smirking irony, making a joke of its white-trash subject matter. It's sung, after all, from the perspective of a man clumsily flirting with his ex's teenage daughter. Hood paints him as a real and relatable person, rather than a cornpone lecher, leaving all his contradictions intact. The Truckers approach these people with care and even respect, which is a crucial lesson for any storyteller. Another one: Write what you know. Hood, Mike Cooley, and Jason Isbell-- the three main songwriters, although Isbell has since gone solo-- pack these songs with well-observed details that don't just sell the songs but suggest a larger world where music might save your life or lead you further astray: ""Rock'n'roll means well but it can't help telling young boys lies,"" Cooley sings over the boogie guitar of ""Marry Me"". The Truckers have been trying to untangle all those lies and to tell some truths for 13 years now, which makes closer ""A World of Hurt"" sound better in this context than it ever did on 2006's lackluster A Blessing and a Curse. ""Remember,"" Hood sings, ""it ain't too late to take a deep breath and throw yourself into it with everything you got."" Such a direct exhortation might sound a bit corny, but the best advice is often the simplest.","Drive-By Truckers' first career retrospective seems too short, but Ugly Buildings still attests to the breadth of the band's music, which ranges in style from gritty rock to Southern soul and ranges in subject from racial politics to recession worries.

Widowspeak,Widowspeak,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b086c0084474cd0c1c73/1:1/w_160/70aa4633.jpg,2011-08-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15735-widowspeak/,Captured Tracks,"It usually takes years of practice and several albums for bands to reach the crestfallen state Brooklyn trio Widowspeak showcase on their debut. Here, the music's poignant rush came quickly: We're told their debut single ""Harsh Realm"" was recorded after the band played a total of six shows. The fatalistic croon of singer/songwriter Molly Hamilton has already garnered plenty of Hope Sandoval comparisons. It would be remiss not to mention those here, as Hamilton's phrasing is often nearly identical to her most obvious influence, but there's enough variation in mood and texture to give this project a weight and balance all of its own. Much of the credit is due to the versatile guitar lines traded between Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas. At times there's a hollowed-out starkness and foreboding to the playing reminiscent of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks (""Puritan""); at others there's a meshing of hippy idealism and influences extracted from bad-vibes garage rock not dissimilar to Love at their peak (see the pleasingly atonal guitar solo that ripples through ""Nightcrawlers""). The latter even bears a moody 1950s tenor that sounds like Alex Zhang Hungtai of Dirty Beaches with the filth cleaned out of his fingernails. Anyone looking to wallow in 1990s nostalgia will find much to gorge on, too-- touchstones from that decade come thick and fast. For instance, when Hamilton's not channeling Sandoval, and when the band crawls out of the doldrums into more upbeat territory (""Gun Shy"", ""Half Awake""), she often resembles Madder Rose singer Mary Lorson. The skill with which Widowspeak assimilates those parts into alluring song structures is what prevents this from being an exercise in tributary. There's an ache to ""Harsh Realm"" that's all their own, the central vocal line (""I always think about you"") bearing a downplayed creepiness that suggests Hamilton knows a thing or two about the ill effects of obsessive love. The one-two punch of ""Gun Shy"" and ""Hard Times"" are where the band hits its peak, the former combining their natural wistfulness with bouts of polished-up Link Wray guitar twang that wouldn't sound out of place on the soundtrack to Tom DiCillo's Johnny Suede. On ""Hard Times"" they bend everything around a featherlight pop framework that provides a perfectly melancholy backbone to Hamilton's naturally listless demeanor: It has the right amount of sun and shade much of Widowspeak possesses, the lightness of touch in the arrangement preventing the songwriting from toppling over into unpalatable sorrow. Sometimes they don't get that balance right-- on ""Fir Coat"" it sounds like the song is racing away from Hamilton, and the closing ""Ghost Boy"" is built around the kind of Moe Tucker-inspired drumming that feels tired in the wake of legions of Brooklyn bands mining the sound over the past few years. But this is clearly the work of a group still finding its way, hammering out the kinks in public view. There's a potential here that could lead to something with a great deal more gravity. It's to Widowspeak's credit that they do make this first taste a brief peak behind the curtain: Five of the 10 songs don't go over the three-minute mark, and the entire runtime's barely half an hour. The economical use of space makes Widowspeak feel like a chance meeting with a pining stranger, one who spills their guts then vanishes from sight just as they're beginning to make an impression.","Widowspeak's captivating singer Molly Hammilton conjures Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval but the key to this crestfallen Brooklyn trio is the guitar work.

Out of Love,Mister Heavenly,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b094c0084474cd0c1c8d/1:1/w_160/48c9a424.jpg,2011-08-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15746-out-of-love/,Sub Pop,"Eight years ago, the smart money would've bet against Nick Thorburn becoming one of the more industrious alumni to emerge from the early-2000s Canadian indie-rock uprising-- his endearingly unstable former band, the Unicorns, could barely make it through a set without experiencing some sort of breakdown (be it technical or psychological). But while he has since emerged as the autonomous creative force behind the prog-pop ensemble Islands (tellingly, it was his face alone that graced the cover of 2009's Vapours) and recently released a low key solo album under the name Nick Diamonds (I Am an Attic), Thorburn has not forgotten what made the Unicorns so special: the alternately cheeky and tense dynamic between himself and ex-bandmate Alden Penner. As such, Thorburn has never shied away from the opportunity to match wits with a creative foil, teaming up with Jim Guthrie for the countrified Human Highway detour and, now, squaring off against Ryan Kattner-- aka Honus Honus of Philly carnival barkers Man Man-- in Mister Heavenly. Thorburn, of course, is no stranger to high-concept side projects (namely, his flirtations with hip-hop in Th' Corn Gangg and Reefer) and, on paper, Mister Heavenly initially reads like a similarly orchestrated lark. The band-- rounded out by Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer-- was reportedly devised around a self-explanatory sub-genre they dubbed ""doom wop."" The stunt-casting of actor Michael Cera as the band's bassist during their spring 2011 tour reinforced the assumption that Mister Heavenly would be a casual, low-stakes endeavor with which Thorburn and Kattner could amuse themselves before returning to their main gigs. But Mister Heavenly's Sub Pop debut proves to be something far more lasting and rewarding: Rather than serve as an outlet for their well-documented eccentric streaks, Thorburn and Kattner's good-cop/bad-cop dynamic yields some of the most tightly focused, immediately engaging songs either principal has produced. Ironically, it's Plummer's band that seems to wield the most influence on the outset, with Thorburn's ominously quiet verses on the opening ""Bronx Sniper"" yielding to an immodest, un-mousey grunge crunch and an especially Isaac Brock-ian howl from Kattner. But, as bracing an introduction as it is, the song's angst-rock ballast does not provide the best showcase of Mister Heavenly's charms. These are more readily revealed when the band settle down and put their modernist spin on early, pre-Beatles rock'n'roll balladry and 1960s tropical pop. Parallel-universe golden-oldies like ""I Am a Hologram"", ""Diddy Eyes"", and ""Hold My Hand"" may not fully live up to the transgressive promise of the ""doom wop"" descriptor but, like fellow 1950s-rock enthusiasts Black Lips and King Khan in their gentler moments, Mister Heavenly approach their AM-radio inspirations with just the right balance of devotion and deviance. (To wit, on the winsome title-track-cum-band-mission-statement ""Mister Heavenly"", Thorburn is not so much claiming to be the man of your dreams as resigning himself to the impossibility of living up to the matinee-idol ideal.) Out of Love's playful spirit sometimes crosses the line into unnecessary indulgence-- the rocksteady rhythm of ""Reggae Pie"" sounds like it'd be fun to groove on in the practice space, but probably didn't need to be featured as the album's longest track (complete with false ending), while the 98-second song that actually bears the title ""Doom Wop"" doesn't even attempt to honor either half of the equation. (Oddly, its sludgy slop-rock sounds uncannily like a tossed-off Ty Segall demo.) However, at no point does it feel like the players are simply using Mister Heavenly as a dumping ground for leftover song scraps they couldn't work into their primary projects: Every song here comes off like a true, collaborative union of the singers' singular personalities, with Thorburn's calm, childlike voice and Kattner's wizened old-soul rasp trading verses and choruses in surprisingly complementary fashion. The effect is mutually corrupting-- by the time we reach the wonderfully warped pen-pal exchange ""Pineapple Girl"", Thorburn sounds like the creepy one while Kattner acts as the stabilizing force. Really, no one would ever accuse Islands or Man Man of lacking character and presence, but once Thorburn and Kattner return to their bands after this dalliance, you'll be excused for thinking they'll sound a little bit incomplete without one another.","The ""doom wop"" project of Nick Thorburn (Islands/Unicorns), Ryan Kattner (Man Man), and Joe Plummer (Modest Mouse) offers a focused, engaging debut.

It's an exercise in writing what you know. The band is made up of 19-year-old girls who have known each other since they were six and have been making music together since they were 14. Razika recorded Program 91 over the course of one year on weekends, to work around their school schedule. They've had the privilege not only of being compared to the Slits, but also of pointing out that the comparison's kind of sexist, since they sound nothing like the Slits. If you're the type who wonders why you weren't more proactive when you were younger, avoid this album. Program 91's basic makeup is spiky, sharp, post-punk-inflected pop, executed with laser-precise accuracy (and a re-contextualized cover of ""Why We Have to Wait"", a song by 1960s Norwegian pop group the Pussycats). In the record's back half, slight dub touches and ska-worthy rhythmic figures enter the mix; the former is squint-your-eyes noticeable, while the latter explicitly serves the band's unassailable sense of time-keeping. The interlocking syncopation is strong enough to suspect that Gorilla Glue plays a part in holding everything together-- that, or lead singer Marie Amdam, who hugs her syllables tightly and with added zest (on ""Vondt I Hjertet"", you can practically feel the spit from her inflected accent hitting your face). Like a lot of indie-pop albums, Program 91 is relatively quick and dirty. But despite its brevity, the album's second side drags a bit, as the skanked rhythms begin to bleed into each other with a lack of individual distinction. Stick around, though, for the album's gorgeous, windswept closer ""Walk in the Park"", an airy slice of melancholia that addresses an open-book relationship while closing out this band's first chapter. After all the peppy guitar lines and young-at-love-and-life razmatazz that one's heart could handle, Program 91 melts down to gentle strums and layered ""ba-da-da""s, saying farewell in the ""we'll meet again"" way that only the best of friends do.","The youthful debut from this indie-pop quartet from Norway (the band is made up of 19-year-old girls who have known each other since they were six and have been making music together since they were 14) is an exercise in writing what you know.

On 2009's The Ruminant Band, the quartet, lead by seasoned indie sideman Eric D. Johnson (Califone, Vetiver, the Shins), eked up the tempo-- sidelining folksier impulses in favor of gently driving guitar pop that channeled Rumors-era Fleetwood Mac. Two years later, they're back to being mellow. With Tripper, the group's fifth album, Johnson dials Fruit Bats' pulse back down, favoring spacious and spacey songwriting that sets the lyrics front and center. It's a record full of stories, with Johnson centering most of the tunes around simple narratives and offbeat characters. On the record's opening track, ""Tony the Tripper"", Johnson dreams up a Kerouac-style road trip with a companion who comes across as one part railroad lifer and one part Burning Man refugee. There are troubles along the way-- schizoid episodes and punker crash pads-- but by the chorus, Johnson and his imagined companion usually have things sorted out: ""We was all under the date palm tree/ They left the rolling of one up to me/ Knowing the world might end tomorrow anyway."" The only problem is that Johnson's tales aren't all that hooky. At least, not enough to buoy Tripper's soft and moody music. Conflict, resolution, and character development often slip by unnoticed, eased in their passage by the woozy synths and atmospherics that function as the album's rough-spot-smoothing sonic hand lotion. On the reverb-soaked ""Wild Honey"", Johnson's lyrics are placed prominently in the mix-- ""Each empire who inherits the sea, rises and retreats into foam/ In the ash there stirs a seed, empty between what's unseen and unknown""-- but get lost in the woozy ambience. The imagery is rich but abstract, and there's not enough muscle in Johnson's plinking guitar to prop it up. Johnson fares better when he takes a more casual tone, as on ""Tangie and Ray"", which follows a pair of hippies as they flee society for nature and, by the sound of it, certain doom. ""Now they're one with the dirt, and the mouldering bones and litter leaves,"" he yelps. It's one of Tripper's more upbeat tunes, benefiting from the full band accompaniment and a driving drum beat. But while the rhythm section makes a difference, it helps that Johnson is keeping a straightforward narrative. He's better with rogues and riffs than heady prose.","With Tripper, the group's fifth album, Fruit Bats dial their pulse back down, favoring spacious and spacey songwriting that sets the lyrics front and center.

Hollow,Cut Off Your Hands,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08a13d197565213a4ab/1:1/w_160/0d210de8.jpg,2011-08-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15738-hollow/,Frenchkiss,"I saw Cut Off Your Hands live in 2007. They had just lost a gig on a children's TV show in their native New Zealand because of their name. When they were booked for the performance they'd been called Shaky Hands, but a threat of legal action by the Portland band Shaky Hands forced them to change it. Their somewhat sarcastic choice of a new moniker cost them a payday. It either didn't phase them or motivated them, because when they got on stage, they were nearly out of control. Vocalist Nick Johnston likes to get into the crowd, and his performing style amounts to a cardio workout. They've grown up quite a bit since then, and though I've heard they're still wild on stage, the music they make in the studio has moved on from their post-punk roots. Hollow, their second LP, sounds much closer to the late-1980s/early-1990s work of British rock bands in the vein of Kitchens of Distinction, the House of Love, and the Trash Can Sinatras. There's a distinctive, clear-toned chime to the guitars, an airy drum sound, and the occasional backing vocal joining Johnston in unison-- it all adds up to something with the feel of that era. It has a dash of classic punk-informed NZ pop like the Bats, too, and should be right in the wheelhouse of anyone who pines for the long-ago days of classic college rock (or simply likes indie rock with a little sweep to it). The band opens the album deceptively, with a shuffling drum beat similar to the one from Sweet's ""Ballroom Blitz"". When the rest of the band comes in, it turns to be a soft-hued and propulsive bit of swooning jangle pop, not some kind of rave-up. ""Hollowed Out"" offers an idea of what Echo and the Bunnymen might have sounded like in the mid-80s if Ian McCulloch had taken a less operatic approach to singing, while the band as a whole is at its finest on the slightly psychedelic ""Nausea"": Johnston's slightly flat singing on the verse sets up the key change and lighter tone of the catchy chorus surprisingly well. ""Nausea""'s easy-moving rhythm highlights one of the band's strengths-- they never sound plodding or like they're struggling to push the songs along. The airy recording aids the band's light touch, too-- the album glides by like it's on skates, its 34 minutes whipping by in an instant. The songs on Hollow are modest-- there's no closing epic, and the choruses are catchy but don't aim to be anthems-- but the band seems to have found its true strength here in a sound that's pretty far removed from the implied violence of its name.","The New Zealand band's sweeping, airy indie rock is far removed from the implied violence of their name, and their second LP, sounds much closer to the late-1980s/early-90s work of British rock bands in the vein of Kitchens of Distinction, the House of Love, and the Trash Can Sinatras.

Ferrari Boyz,Gucci ManeWaka Flocka Flame,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08b13d197565213a4ad/1:1/w_160/2bde4ebb.jpg,2011-08-23 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15739-ferrari-boyz/,Warner Bros.,"Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame have always shared a symbiotic relationship. With Gucci frequently in and out of jail, keeping the Brick Squad name and label relevant has mostly fallen on Waka's shoulders, and he's done a more than adequate job, releasing a few legitimate radio hits as well as one of the best rap albums of last year. Waka has also gathered a host of new rappers under Brick Squad's wings-- most notably Slim Dunkin, who appears on Ferrari Boyz twice-- and while likely none of them will end up as stars, the brand extension certainly can't hurt. Waka, of course, was brought along for the ride as Gucci ascended upward, and his success was undoubtedly accelerated by his proximity to Gucci's budding stardom. What made the partnership work artistically is that their styles are almost completely opposite. At the height of his profligacy, Gucci was penning colorful and singular verses that, from a writing and conceptual standpoint, put him in rap's upper tier. But he also had a keen ear for pop; his best hooks were almost impossibly intricate (arguably even unnecessarily so, considering how much music he gave away for free), and he managed to embed most of his ad-libs in the genre's collective consciousness. Standing in stark contrast, Waka's style is purposefully non-lyrical, and his choruses are often him just shouting a phrase or two-- no less catchy, but still an altogether different tactic. And where Gucci's beats were highly musical, Waka's are often loud and seemingly best fit for head banging. If Gucci painted pictures, Waka looks at a blank canvas and dumps a can of red paint on it. Then maybe breaks it over his knee. But here's the dirty secret about Waka and Gucci: They've never worked well as collaborators. Though they've now been on dozens of songs together, none ranks in either artist's upper echelon, and many have been an outright bore. On paper, their styles do not mesh, and in practice they don't either. They both sound awkward and out of place on each other's tracks-- Gucci blunts Waka's raw emotion, and Waka leaves little room for Gucci's writerly leanings. That trend doesn't change on Ferrari Boyz, their official commercially released collaborative album. Most of their collaborations arrived after Waka really blew up, and they've found Gucci heavily drawn to his aesthetic. That can probably be chalked to staying with the hot hand-- basically everyone in rap is flocking to the beats of producers Lex Luger and Southside (who partly owe their success to Waka's), so why go in a different direction? And truly, if you took Gucci's contributions off Ferrari Boyz and replaced them with Brick Squad underlings, you'd probably be looking at something close to Flockaveli's follow-up. But that raises another question: If Gucci is worlds better than guys like YG Hootie and Kebo Gotti, shouldn't Ferrari Boyz be as good, if not better, than Flockaveli? Theoretically, yes, but it's missing most of the elements that made Waka's solo album so great and so invigorating. Namely, it lacks the manic energy that is Waka's calling card: If it's possible to go through the motions while still mostly shouting, Ferrari Boyz would be a prime example. The album can also get drearily monotonous-- though at times the beats will switch out of the album's minor key template, Ferrari Boyz desperately lacks the standout outliers like ""Fuck the Club Up"" or ""Grove St. Party"" that help buoy Flockaveli. The album does pick up near the end: ""Too Loyal"" rides a blippy beat that's maybe the record's most fun production, and it also finds Gucci retaining some of the playfulness that's always been a part of his music. ""So Many Things"", the real keeper, is a fluttery track that finds Gucci singing the album's best hook with an endearingly amateur whine. (It should come as no surprise as to who is behind both: Fatboi, a frequent Gucci cohort.) Though guys like Hootie couldn't hold Gucci's rhyme book, they fit perfectly into Waka's aesthetic-- even if they don't rock anti-skill as a skill nearly as well as he does, they're at least willing to sound animated. Gucci, in contrast, puts little effort into his writing here, which is made all the worse by him sounding profoundly bored, tired, stoned, or some combination of the three. It's a problem that has plagued a lot of his music recently, but it's a bigger issue now that he doesn't have the appropriate production to perk, or prop, him up. That said, Ferrari Boyz is far from dire-- it's largely just disappointing. Gucci and Waka still don't sound at home together, and it's of little comfort that their clashing styles are what made them great in the first place.","This is the first full-length collaboration between the rappers, whose styles are almost completely opposite.

Slave Ambient,The War on Drugs,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b084ea9e61561daa6635/1:1/w_160/aa207230.jpg,2011-08-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15733-slave-ambient/,Secretly Canadian,"Slidin'. Ramblin'. Driftin'. Movin'. Strugglin'. The War on Drugs frontman Adam Granduciel is all of these things on Slave Ambient, the Philly outfit's second full-length release. Given these professed feelings of restlessness and uneasiness, it's no surprise the band's hypno-roots-rock is all about forward motion and momentum, favoring steady, locomotive rhythms that rarely pause or waver-- elements that reinforce Granduciel's efforts to make his problems disappear in the rearview mirror. Slave Ambient shares several qualities with its 2008 predecessor, Wagonwheel Blues: a sense of open-freeway abandon and splendid isolation set against a glorious expanse; an unabashed admiration for FM-radio Americana icons of yore (Springsteen, Dylan, Petty); and a willingness to buff the band's gritty edges with serene, if randomly deployed, instrumentals and reprises. In other words, the War on Drugs still deal in ""excellent road trip music,"" as Pitchfork's Stephen Deusner described Wagonwheel Blues. However, this time Granduciel is less interested in documenting the environmental and economic travesties he sees unfolding outside his window as he is the internal dramas swirling around in his head. Nearly every song here expresses some desire to get outta town and start anew. The band responds by amplifying the more textural qualities of their sound: dreamy synth drones, liquefied electric-guitar leads that linger and fade like raindrops rolling down the windshield, and the most tasteful use of smooth saxophone this side of Kaputt. (Interestingly enough, Slave Ambient was recorded without founding member Kurt Vile, who applies a similarly lysergic approach on his latest solo release, Smoke Ring For My Halo-- for fans of rustic rock'n'roll, the two albums collectively yield an embarrassment of riches not experienced since Wilco and Son Volt released A.M. and Trace in tandem.) When the band's wide-screened psychedelic flourishes are fused with Granduciel's well-worn Dylan- and Petty-isms, songs like ""Brothers"" and ""It's Your Destiny"" wondrously conjure nothing so much as the Traveling Wilburys recording for mid-1980s 4AD. Or in the case of the excitable ""Baby Missiles"" (a holdover from last year's stop-gap Future Weather EP), it's as if the Spiritualized and Springsteen albums filed alphabetically next to one another in your record collection had melted together on a hot August afternoon. But as much as the War on Drugs make music to accompany an escape to something better, they're the sort of band that believes the journey is more important than the destination. The songs on Slave Ambient don't necessarily end in a place very different from where they began, but through subtle sonic manipulations and layering-- like in the last two minutes of opener ""Best Night"", where the guitars, piano, and melodica start to blur into the same blissful wavelength-- they give the impression that a great distance has been traveled. The really amazing thing about the album is how anthemic and affirming it feels despite the near total absence of proper sing-along choruses. Case in point, centerpiece track ""Come to the City"" is all about ascension, rising out of the miasmic haze of preceding interlude ""The Animator"" and gradually accruing all the confidence and verve of Live Aid-era U2. But rather than work up a chest-thumping, Bono-worthy wail, Granduciel is happy to sit back and ride out the song's dense waves of sound, to prolong the euphoric feeling of anticipation-- the road trip he's soundtracking is very much his own, and he's as much a slave to the ambience as we are.","Slidin'.

Atlantic EP,Southern Shores,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0859d034d5c69bf48b0/1:1/w_160/de1e4838.jpg,2011-08-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15734-atlantic-ep/,Cascine,"Southern Shores are the latest Balearic-leaning group with a release on Cascine, a label following in the footsteps of Swede counterparts Sincerely Yours and Service. Sonically, the Canadian duo mine the same brand of nostalgia-flecked ecstasy as Air France or even the Avalanches, but the their choice of samples and propulsive rhythms trade in the lightheaded focus of those groups for something clubbier. The summer mood of their Atlantic EP debut is largely carried on waves of optimistic major chord shifts, but there's an introspective, thoughtful quality to the production that lends enough depth to reward repeat trips. ""Tangier Winds"", for example, samples a grab bag of a cappella vocals-- including 1990s R&B smoothies U-Mnyd-- each contributing a distinct sentiment to what eventually becomes a cluttered conversation. The lyrical snatches are just intangible enough to add a heavy feeling of romance to a bedrock of lush keys and drifting bass patterns. The resulting effect is a satisfying tangle of jammed frequencies. ""Night Is Young"" plays similar sampling tricks, but here the clipped vocals lose themselves in more propulsive surroundings. Unlike the relatively stable dynamics of ""Tangier Winds"", the momentum shifts gears throughout, carrying more of a disco palette than anything else on the record. There's a fun and hedonistic Salsoul vibe to the track-- Shep Pettibone and Cathy Dennis are among the samples-- an idea that feels just distinct enough to work as a worthwhile homage exercise as well as a blissed-out summer dance track. Pretty much everything on Atlantic exists in a seasonal haze-- nobody's going to mistake this for anything but a record of summer jams. That tight focus may seem limited in scope, but it helps yield the EP's concentrated burst of sensation. And, while the majority of recent sun-drenched music's been concerned with retelling half-remembered feelings from the past, Southern Shores escape that vacuum by investing in the moment at hand: As the opening track title ""Take Me Anywhere"" suggests, this is music that not only wants to soundtrack your vacation, it wants to be your vacation.","Canadian synth-pop duo Southern Shores want to be your summer vacation.

Watch Me Dance,Toddla T,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0895e6ef95969321fa6/1:1/w_160/15ae114f.jpg,2011-08-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15737-watch-me-dance/,Ninja Tune,"Revivalism and surprise might not always be mutually exclusive, but combining the two is tricky. It's been done, especially in dance music. But if you can't pull off that sneaky alchemical future-retroism, you can at least try to cast a broad net, paying homage to a lingering idea of a few distinct scenes and highlighting juxtaposition, if not actual cohesion. Toddla T was merely a preschooler during rave's late 1980s UK explosion, but by the end of the 90s he'd begun to DJ before he was old enough to drive. Another decade's worth of experience spinning other people's records meant he had his ear finely tuned when it came time to make his own-- so far his career's been a fair-minded exercise in consolidating a sprawl of electronic dance music history into a loosely-tied catchall that covers grime, dancehall, electro, and all points between. Sophomore album Watch Me Dance is a by-the-book collection of eclectic throwbacks, hitting all the right sounds in a non-superficial fashion, but not advancing much further into unexplored territory. There's early single ""Take It Back"", and all the double-meaning that title implies-- lyrical nostalgia for the initial, now-faded rush of a young and happy relationship, paired with sonic nostalgia of a hip-house-inflected Soul II Soul homage. ""Badman Flu"" nods towards dawn-of-the-90s ragga/rave, driven by a charging 808 throb and a pitched-up stammer break worthy of old-school 'ardkore label Shut Up and Dance. On the other end of that decade, ""Streets So Warm"" filters digital dancehall through burbling dial-tone synths and finds a way to build emotional resonance off a bassline that consists solely of sparse, one-note ""WHOMP""'s. The opening title track's a tenuously Prince-ly 80s funk-rock cut that rides on live (or live-sounding) drums and slap bass-- and doesn't sound a damn thing like any of the other songs on the album. There are also beats that seem bewilderingly, naggingly vague and detached from any chronologically or historically tangible movements, yet still clearly look backwards. ""Cruise Control"" and ""Cherry Picking"" are propulsive and hooky, and as good examples as any to point out how well Toddla T can assemble bass lines and breaks that, while intricate, never distract you from how danceable they are. But on an album that leans so heavily on acknowledging influences, they don't seem to have a distinct reference of their own-- they're not reminiscent of anything, whether it's a stylistic homage or a unique sonic identity the producer's still in the process of establishing. That leaves the album's roster of guest vocalists to pick up the slack, and it does benefit from a wide cross-section of enduring veterans-- Roots Manuva casually murmuring laidback come-ons on the title track, Roisin Murphy doing her best enigmatic Annie Lennox on ""Cherry Picking"", Wayne Marshall giving ""Streets So Warm"" a piercing gut-punch pathos, and a warm turn from Ms. Dynamite on the vintage-reggae ""Fly"" that makes for another fine entry in her current comeback bid. Toddla T's ear for collaborators is matched by his sense of restraint: This is an album that aims for radio and clubs alike instead of shooting for the overload of songs geared strictly toward bassbins. Watch Me Dance doesn't reconcile the clash between retro and modernism, but at least it does the past a decent amount of justice.","Sheffield producer Toddla T's sophomore album is is an eclectic mix of dance throwbacks fleshed out by a roster of veteran guest vocalists.

Revisited & Remixed (1970-1999),Popol Vuh,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08313d197565213a4a0/1:1/w_160/f0c1a6d0.jpg,2011-08-22 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15732-revisited-remixed-1970-1999/,SPV,"Boiling down the work of any group that spanned three decades is never going to be easy. For German avant gardists Popol Vuh, it's practically impossible. The band was founded by Florian Fricke in 1969 and largely remained his vision throughout, albeit with useful accomplices picked up along the way. Popol Vuh are often slotted into krautrock/kosmische musik categories, but their work also variously edged close to prog, new age, and ambient. They are perhaps best known for providing the soundtracks to many of Werner Herzog's feature films, and this year the SPV label put out a box set gathering some of those. ""Florian was always able to create music I feel helps audiences visualize something hidden in the images onscreen, and in our own souls too,"" said the director in Herzog on Herzog. Here, SPV again pays tribute to Fricke on the 10th anniversary of his death, gathering strains of the band's original recordings and completing the package with a disc of remixes. This is the kind of release that will have longstanding Popol Vuh followers raising an eyebrow at what's not included-- the monolithic drone piece ""Vuh"" from In den Gärten Pharaos is missing, and there's nothing from the classic 1972 release Hosianna Mantra. It's heavy on the soundtrack work and sequenced in non-chronological order, beginning with the stirring ""Aguirre I - Lacrima Di Rei"" from Herzog's 1972 feature Aguirre, the Wrath of God. The synergy between Herzog and Fricke comes from a place where malevolence, beauty, and eminence are vying for equal space. ""Aguirre I"" features peals of artificial choir sound, played by Fricke on a mellotron-like device called a ""choir organ"" that triggered tiny loops of field recordings. It's a colossal sound that feels both daunting and alluring, something to fear and rejoice in at the same time, where the real and the unreal seem to seep into one another. Fricke's Aguirre soundtrack is among the best work he produced in his career, but there's such scope to the Popol Vuh sound that it scarcely matters that the bar is raised so high so early. The lengthy title track from the band's debut record Affenstunde (1970) documents Fricke's fascination with folksy percussion and the mantra-like possibilities that emerged from sustaining single notes on a Moog. That space between artifice and actuality is where Popol Vuh's music finds its muscle, adding to the feeling of something arching across ancient and contemporary worlds, with Fricke jostling between earthy textures and the inter-planetary visions of his krautrock contemporaries. ""Affenstunde"" is paired with the similarly epic ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" on Revisited & Remixed, which forms another placid divide between pulsing synth noise, primitive hand percussion, balmy Rhodes-like plinking, and sounds extracted from the natural world. It might have been better to follow ""Affenstunde"" with the much darker ""Vuh"" instead of ""In den Gärten Pharaos"", just to show off the great surge of energy they were capable of summoning. But there are so many sides to Popol Vuh that it's no surprise some are missing on this release. Instead, a couple of superior cuts from the soundtrack to Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre are among the highlights. Here Fricke again explores the dichotomy between the real and the unreal and the primitive and the present, through throaty voice manipulations, contemplative acoustic plucking, raga-like drones, and playful baroque arrangements. It's difficult to listen to Popol Vuh's career broken down in this way, dislocated from the strange trajectory they followed. Lurching from the ambient precursor ""Ich Mache Einen Spiegel"" to the sweeping drift of the Cobra Verde soundtrack feels messy and unfocused. Instead, this record is best seen as a jumping off point for the uninitiated, a way to point travelers in the right direction instead of a singular piece in its own right. The second disc is an uneven selection of prosaic remixes, with few highlights. Haswell & Hecker's reworking of ""Aguirre I/II"" taps into that extraordinary otherworldly quality of the original piece, building it into a towering wall of shifting noise then shattering it apart as though they've taken a hammer to glass. Elsewhere, too many of the artists sound like they're attempting to assimilate sounds into their own catalogs: Mouse on Mars' version of ""Through Pain to Heaven"" is an incongruously heavy handed club jam, while Stereolab's take on ""Hosianna Mantra"" papers over all the peculiar elements that make Popol Vuh such an alluring listen. Thomas Fehlmann's version of ""Schnee"" works better, with its piston-like rhythm veering closer to Fricke's world. Perversely, what the remixes lack-- risk, pomposity, refinement, transformative power-- is everything Popol Vuh's original recordings feed off to find their mettle.","On the 10th anniversary of Florian Fricke's death, a collection of the German avant gardists' thrilling original recordings plus a disc of prosaic remixes.

Leave No Trace,Fool's Gold,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b082c0084474cd0c1c6f/1:1/w_160/bee75614.jpg,2011-08-22 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15731-leave-no-trace/,IAMSOUND,"We sure got over Afro-pop real fast, right? Jokes aside, even if King Sunny Ade hasn't exactly surpassed Thurston Moore as a dominant post-2007 influence, those spindly leads, clean guitar tones, and assorted hand percussion are more primary colors at this point than elements that automatically set a band apart. They were certainly omnipresent on Fool's Gold's 2009 self-titled debut, but the Los Angeles collective distinguished itself from its peers (including guitarist/songwriter Lewis Pesacov's more straightforward Foreign Born) with a rhythmic verve and a bewitching, enigmatic quality that wasn't entirely attributable to Luke Top singing primarily in Hebrew-- though that played a part. Now there's Leave No Trace, sung almost entirely in English, pointedly more conventional in song structure, and given a bright, crisp, electric sheen that uses its cover art as a guiding sonic principle. In other words, Fool's Gold made a Foreign Born record. But hey, Foreign Born albums are certainly enjoyable in their own right, and regardless of which band it came from, ""The Dive"" is the most immediately hooky song Pesacov's been involved with so far (unless you're counting his production with Best Coast). They skew more toward ""Brit-"" than ""Afro-"" in its pop, the galloping snare beat, briskly strummed acoustics, and high-fretboard arpeggios recalling a souped-up Smiths or Orange Juice. You might even hear it as a mixtape staple for a summer crush based on its most stressed lyric (""No I won't stop staring/ And I can't stop from watching""), even if it's meant as rubberneck commentary on a friend guided by their own destructive impulses. Nothing else is quite as instantly ingratiating, but ""The Dive"" does reveal a sonic attitude that Leave No Trace follows-- even if the pinging guitar lines, lolling vocals, and rhythms take their inspiration from any number of continents, it all maintain a casual affability of an Echo Park barbecue. Take a blind taste test of the slip-sliding bassline and group-hug harmonies on ""Wild Window"" or the quacking guitar effects of ""Street Clothes""-- none of it would sound too out of place between a Red Hot Chili Peppers or Sublime track on a KROQ superset. Which is sort of a bummer, since Leave No Trace as a whole seems like a talented group of musicians perfectly alright with being the Red Stripe in a cooler of Budweisers, an enjoyable diversion distinguished by attractive packaging and a vague, ultimately unremarkable exoticism. Though prone to the occasional camp-Bowie affectation, like the similarly worldly Zach Condon, Top favors an elongated croon that pulls notes like taffy and works up to some sticky harmonies. But too many melodies take the same kind of angles, leaving the choral turns of ""Wild Window"", ""Narrow Sun"", and the title track to be sorted out by a matter of increment. And while Top's lyrics concerning the bothersome pace of modern life generally create friction against their serotonin-boosted arrangements, the words themselves give a whiff of just a little too much misplaced effort. Likewise, the band's formidable live dynamics are canceled out by the sleek and beveled production, leaving the sort of things that should be integrated touches-- the bump and grind Bollywood rhythm of ""Balmy"", the contrast between the hard, guttural consonants of Hebrew and melismatic English on ""Tel Aviv"", ""Lantern""'s doo-wop affectations-- as the main focus. Having a name like Fool's Gold always felt like tempting fate, especially when working in a style that can be a battlefield for the Realness Wars. But this album title? On a record that aspires more to be sociable than remembered, they're really asking for it.","For their second Fool's Gold full-length, Lewis Pesacov, Luke Top, and co. tone down the Afro-pop and basically made a Foreign Born record.

Mirror Traffic,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b088ea9e61561daa6639/1:1/w_160/288e66e0.jpg,2011-08-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15736-mirror-traffic/,MatadorDomino,"As we spend the next nine years critically dissecting and reassessing the 1990s, let's agree to make one historical revision: The lo-fi auteurs of the era-- your Malkmuses, your Pollards, your Elephant Sixers-- were not in fact ""slackers,"" despite the prevailing label/insult of the the day. Truthfully, their lack of studio polish was not a matter of laziness, ironic aesthetic, or poverty, but a coping mechanism for the unstoppable torrent of melodies, words, and ideas exploding from each songwriter's brain. No time for getting that song exactly right-- on to the next one. That first-draft immediacy can fade with success, creative fatigue, or that demon ""maturity."" In the case of Malkmus, the transformation took the flavor of just wanting to play his damn guitar-- a mid-life crisis where sports cars were replaced with extended solos, ornate riffs, and long songs that felt even longer. But if the recent rash of alt-rock reunions were meant to cash in on audience nostalgia, perhaps some happy memories ricocheted back onto the bandleaders as they revisited their ragged, spontaneous greatest hits. To put it plainly, Mirror Traffic is not the time travel back to Pavement's peak that is the futile wish of every 30-something indie dork, but it is a rewind to a less perfectionist Malkmus, packed with the most mischief and weirdness he's displayed since his eponymous solo debut. It also has the most songs since Wowee Zowee. Like that declaration of independence from the confines of a successful band, Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting his earlier days in NoCal. Despite originally wanting to title the album L.A. Guns and putting the hard-rocking ""Senator"" forward as the first single, Malkmus largely lays off the Guitar Hero: The fretboard theatrics are used more sparingly and deployed to much greater effect on ""Forever 28"" where a ""Mr. Blue Sky"" bounce is interrupted by Thin Lizzy runs, or in the thrilling summertime riff of ""Stick Figures in Love"". Only three songs break the five-minute barrier, and these feel far less claustrophobic than the extended tracks on the last three Jicks records. ""Share the Red""'s shambolic waltz, for instance, goes down easier than the 10-minute-long interlocking duets of ""Real Emotional Trash"". Songs also move in unexpected directions, like the Go! Team-ish coda of ""No One Is (As I Are Be)"" or the slingshot tempo changes of ""Spazz"". Even a brief interstitial like ""Jumblegloss""-- with cosmic guitars and unidentifiable auditory objects whirring by-- is a refreshing bit of spontaneity to rinse after the album's most Jicks-like rocker, ""Brain Gallop"". The less serious vibe better suits Malkmus' still intact sense of humor and menagerie of oddballs (opening here with a nudist in Birkenstocks and ending 15 songs later with a cousin ""down with soft rap""). Happily, celebrity producer Beck doesn't employ the heavy hand he showed earlier this year on Thurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts, which re-enacted Sea Change with the Sonic Youth frontman on vocals. Here, Beck's fingerprints are lighter-- he plays enabler to Malkmus' quirks, leaving in mid-vocal laughs, adding subtle lap-steel on ""Tigers"" and ""Long Hard Book"", and fuzzing out the punkish ""Spazz"" and ""Tune Grief"". Whether he likes it or not, Malkmus is the indie-rock version of a Dylan or Simon or U2, artists who will forever be blurbed as making ""their best album since ____."" Competing with his younger self is definitely not a priority for Malkmus, who went through Pavement's reunion tour like he was punching a clock. Any resemblance to earlier days is likely unintentional, but for the aging hipsters of the world, even an accidental flashback is a good contact high. Mirror Traffic tickles that nostalgia without sacrificing maturity, discovering that ""playfully relaxed"" is a valid third route between ""slacker"" and ""manic.""","Stephen Malkmus' Beck-produced Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting the Pavement frontman's earlier days.

Marble Son,Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b080ea9e61561daa662c/1:1/w_160/159fe5d0.jpg,2011-08-12 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15729-marble-son/,Fargo,"Phil Wandscher doesn't get top billing in Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter, but the former Whiskeytown guitar player is by far the most prominent presence on the band's fourth full-length, Marble Son. Upstaging Sykes is difficult: The Seattle-based singer possesses a distinctive voice with the eloquent grain of a young Marianne Faithfull, but with a tendency to strain toward certain notes that suggests a barely contained emotional distress. She haunts the band's first two albums, 2002's Reckless Burning and 2004's Oh, My Girl, which both retrofitted 1990s alt-country influences to a darker Americana. Starting with 2007's Like Love Lust & the Open Halls of the Soul, however, Wandscher has become less of a sideman and more of a bandleader, which is fine: He's a resourceful guitar player who allows these tunes to careen and serve perilously. This development has its advantages and disadvantages. Like Neko Case before her, Sykes abandoned the more straightforward country-soul of her early albums for a more idiosyncratic style that favors oddly shaped jams over vocal melodies. What should be more personal is actually more impersonal-- Marble Son sounds coded, vague, purposefully obscure. ""Come to Mary, she don't mind,"" she sings on the vaguely Catholic ""Come to Mary"". The line repeats several times, but it's less a hook than an excerpt from a larger melody. Sykes has never had tremendous range, nor has she really needed it; in the past, she's gotten by on sheer tone and expressiveness. Yet, on opener ""Hushed by Devotion"" and the folksy ""Be It Me or Be It None"", she sounds too detached, too cold, such that her voice gets lost in the mix-- never quite as assertive or as evocative as she could be. It sounds like she's holding back, trying to fit into the band, but with an instrument like hers, that seems like driving a plane when you could be flying. By contrast, Wandscher's guitar never sounds hushed or hesitant. It never shies from the spotlight or fades into the background. He's a bold player, which means he can carry these songs by himself. Marble Son is the band's heaviest album to date, perhaps owing to their recent collaborations with Sunn O))) and Boris. That context makes Wandscher's updates on San Francisco rock riffs all the more intriguing, especially on ""Ceiling's High"" and ""Your Own Kind"", whose central themes could have mutated directly from the Dead themselves. On ""Hushed by Devotion"", the band launches abruptly into a faster jam, propelled into a new direction by a few brazen notes from Wandscher. It's a great moment, but they do the same trick several other times, most egregiously on ""Pleasuring the Divine"". With every repetition it loses power, emphasizing rather than concealing the band's limitations. Instead of exploring their sound and growing more dexterous over time, Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter have backed themselves into a creative corner on Marble Son-- with a sound so austere it becomes tedious instead of heady, tentative instead of revelatory.","Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter's fourth album favors oddly shaped jams and is their heaviest to date.

Amplifying Host,Richard Youngs,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07f5e6ef95969321f9a/1:1/w_160/18ddae0a.jpg,2011-08-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15728-amplifying-host/,Jagjaguwar,"The spate of albums Richard Youngs has made for Jagjaguwar-- nine in the past 11 years-- have covered a range of sounds and ideas. But there's something single-minded, even monastic about the way he's made each one. Typically, he focuses devoutly on a single approach, sticking with the same instrumentation, tempos, and tones from track to track. Even records that could be considered outliers-- take last year's pop-oriented Beyond the Valley of the Ultrahits-- have a core personality that make adjacent songs like fraternal twins. Amplifying Host takes that genetic consistency to a microscopic level. I needed multiple listens to tell these six songs apart, all of which generally start the same way-- with a slow, bent note-- and are built from the same parts: long electric guitar twangs, gentle acoustic strums, big bass rumbles, and Youngs' deliberate, extended-syllable singing. They also include drumming from Damon Krukowski (of Galaxie 500 and Damon and Naomi), but he's so backgrounded I didn't initially notice his contributions, which are primarily atmospheric cymbal washes. Whatever elements are there, Youngs' vocals are the center, in ways good and... well, never bad, but sometimes perplexing. He's often found success with more formal singing modes-- take the chant-like melodic lines of 2009's Under Stellar Steam-- but here he's more interested in deviating from the paths he lays. He'll sing a line, vary it slightly, wander away, then curve back close to but not exactly where he started. Floating between form and improvisation, he mixes the searching quality of Bill Callahan with the stubborn dodge of Jandek. Which makes songs like the pensive ""Tessellations"" or the simple ""Too Strong for the Power""-- which feels a lot longer than its 13 minute duration-- both enticing and maddening. Youngs always sounds like he's going to coalesce his lines into a climactic chorus, but his angles never quite straighten, instead birthing even more tangents. I'm probably making Amplifying Host sound more difficult than it is. The bulk is warm and inviting, as hypnotic as any Youngs record. Let it envelop you without worrying about where it's going, and it'll massage your brain even as it evades it. If you do find Youngs' skewed perspective frustrating, there's a reward at the end. On ""This Is the Music"", he allows himself a true chorus: ""This is the sunshine of generations/ Music of exaltation/ This is the time of fulfillment."" The music's measured rhythm and plaintive chords may belie those bright sentiments, but if everything lined up perfectly, this wouldn't be Richard Youngs.","On Amplifying Host, British experimentalist Richard Youngs takes his devotion to a single approach to the microscopic level.

Yucca,Milk Maid,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07e5e6ef95969321f96/1:1/w_160/1e878a3f.jpg,2011-08-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15727-yucca/,Fat Cat,"There are different ways to approach the band purgatory of ""indefinite hiatus."" You could maintain a dignified silence, either letting the memory of your band live relatively untarnished in the hearts of fans, or maybe building up feverish anticipation for a lucrative reunion tour. You could start a blog, an acting career, or some other non-music project. There's also always the possibility of starting a new project to satiate your musical urges. Like many artists, Martin Cohen, bassist of UK lad-rockers Nine Black Alps, has chosen Door No. 3, recording songs under the name Milk Maid primarily from his Manchester apartment. From the blast of distortion on opener ""Such Fun"" on, Yucca clearly basks in the influence of a few 1990s lo-fi indie greats. Guided by Voices have been the chief comparison so far, but Cohen isn't as strong a singer or as gifted a melodicist as Robert Pollard and where 11 songs make up Yucca's 33 1/2-minute running time, GBV could easily cram at least two dozen songs in that window. Milk Maid is more similar to a group like Sebadoh in musical and lyrical content, combining mostly sunny, pop-friendly melodies with macabre imagery and the occasional spate of abject self-loathing-- at least in the handful of lyrics that you can make out. Cohen injects a little irony into ""Such Fun"", delivering the bouncy, jaunty tune-- and its chorus of ""'Round, 'round, 'round, and over again""-- with an affect so distant, that it sounds like he's lamenting a tedious exercise, regardless of the slightly more energetic backing vocals that punctuate the hook. ""Dead Wrong"" puts an emphasis on the former word of its title, with the song's first few lines splattered with blood from dismembered limbs and stab wounds in the stomach. The first verse of the 49-second ""Kill Me Again"" simulates the back-and-forth of a lovers' spat, with Cohen singing, ""Kill me again... And then I'll kill you."" Most of Yucca's violent images are delivered as a metaphor for a deteriorating relationship, relating to the death of a romance as death in the most literal terms. Reportedly inspired by the recording approach of Sic Alps, but mostly lacking the bloodthirsty snarl the San Francisco basement dwellers capturing on tape, Yucca is almost split evenly between propulsive, driving, pop-influenced garage-rock tunes and downtempo almost-ballads covered in a thick topcoat of fuzz. The catchiest of these-- ""Can't You See"", with its acoustic guitar drowned-out by heavily distorted electric guitar, late-album climax ""Back of Your Knees', the buoyant power-pop of ""Not Me""-- are torn wide open by ear-splitting guitar solos, ably and excitingly straddling the line between noise and pop. While its lyrics-- especially the hook of ""She was American / She was an American girl""-- aren't especially gripping, ""Girl"" provides a refreshing cool down in the midst of the blown, overheated amps exploding across most of the collection. A melancholy sway marks ""Someone You Thought You'd Forgot"", finding Cohen using his voice to deliver a kind of sadness that perfectly matches the song's chords. The song itself makes for an appropriate closing track-- it feels like the soundtrack for saying goodbye to someone, all long faces, downturned eyes, and slow, monotone speech. It's softer feel also illustrates the dynamic range Cohen has as a songwriter on his first solo outing, one that isn't especially revelatory or inventive, but does offer a solid starting point for the second chapter of his career.","The solo project of UK ""post-grunge"" crew Nine Black Alps' bassist Martin Cohen basks in the influence of 1990s lo-fi greats.

Closer to Closed,Braid,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05ab1335d7bf169a0db/1:1/w_160/2e2a2b2f.jpg,2011-08-12 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15697-closer-to-closed/,Polyvinyl,"We were the new Nathan Detroits. We assumed everything while Ariel danced in her room and took off her clothes. We were at their last show where Bob Nanna cried and maybe we did, too. Sure, this is a composite sketch, but we repped Braid to the fullest back when emo meant something. Of course, that ""something"" mostly meant humble Midwesterners with enough start-stop trickery and ""auxiliary screaming guy"" to crucially place themselves in the cred lineage of Fugazi even if the lyrics yelled ""do you like me?"" more than ""you are not what you own."" It's been hard since then: not just because Braid went dormant, but because emo's domination of early-2000s radio was a pyrrhic victory, its ensuing evolution leading to its becoming the single most vilified form in all of indie rock. But oh shit, Braid are back. Even if Closer to Closed is just a four-song EP, come on! Chris Broach in the building! Unfortunately, the brevity of Closer to Closed only makes it easier to remember that this is also pretty much the same band as Hey Mercedes, a competently forgettable Vagrant latecomer that made Everynight Fire Works, a record I haven't listened to in a decade mostly because I recall it sounding a hell of a lot like this. ""This"" mostly meaning market-tested emo-pop with the emotion and pop aspects sterilized by an unwillingness to commit to either. It sounded somewhat desperate back when there felt like a reason and a market to sell out for, but now it just sounds utterly clueless. This year, we've seen Taking Back Sunday, Saves The Day, and the Get Up Kids attempting to play catch up with themselves, but here Braid bafflingly jettison the goodwill of their past: the palm-muted verses and squeaky choruses, the one-sided conversations of the lyrics, the antiseptic production-- I'll say it could come from anyone because you probably don't remember who the Pinehurst Kids are. With not a single sharp edge provided by any riffs or even Broach (whose guitar doodles enough in the margins to let you know that he actually showed up), you haven't much choice but to sort of pitifully engage with Closer to Closed like a nervous friend before a huge date he's clearly going to fuck up. During its first two clean-shaven and aloe-moisturized choruses, Chris Broach sings, ""It could never be this good again/ You know it's true,"" and Nanna, ""I want a do over, do over, do over."" If you want to project your vague romantic frustration onto a blank slate, this'll do. You can just as easily take it as running commentary on Closer to Closed itself, stuck for inspiration outside of constantly introducing and apologizing for its own existence. (Congratulations...I'm Sorry, y'know?) ""I wouldn't mind a second try,"" Nanna chirps on ""Do Over"", and at its climax, ""now is the part where I break your heart"" flips to ""this is the part where we break some hearts."" Hearing them stoop to the Panic! At the Disco-era necessity of establishing some sort of conspiratorial fourth-wall busting narrative with the listener is just such a fucking bummer that you can't even muster the energy to use their own words against them.Which is incredibly easy since Nanna's lyrics have further devolved into pure emo madlibbing. Of course, it might be just as easy for you to point out that I'm a grown man and wanting Braid to pick up and recreate 1998 on the rebound is no more rational than my college friends expecting me to knock off that bottle of Goldschlager and somehow shake it off before that huge presentation the next morning. But are you seriously asking Braid fans to not care so much? Let us mourn in peace-- Urbana's just too fucking dark, and it's not getting any brighter.","The influential 1990s Illinois band is back: Longtime fans will be crying for the wrong reasons.

"Not the Spaces You Know, But Between Them",Various Artists,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0679d034d5c69bf487f/1:1/w_160/7afdbcde.jpg,2011-08-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15710-not-the-spaces-you-know-but-between-them/,Three Lobed,"Quick: How many record labels can you name? Unless you work inside certain sects of the music industry, the answer, at most, is likely a couple dozen. Yet the number of working imprints in the world-- from the biggest corporate conglomerates to the upstarts young bands craft only so they can have a logo to put on the back of whatever they issue-- is incalculable because it's ever-changing. That is, running a record label is a risky business plan, where one mistake about the number of units you might move can torpedo the entire operation, where technological sea changes can wash the need for you and your product away. Labels, then, tend to memorialize every few years, commemorating every anniversary with a limited-edition box set, a spree of concerts, or an appreciative giveaway. However deserved it may be, this is self-congratulations of the purest sort, a proud proclamation that the brand has yet again made it to some arbitrary finish line. To that end, Three Lobed Recordings' Not the Spaces You Know, But Between Them is a different kind of birthday set. Meant to mark the 10th anniversary of the tiny North Carolina outsider music label, the collection subverts the usual order of such pieces, serving more as a celebration of the participating bands than the presenting brand. The packaging-- a hard paper box containing four LPs and liner notes, all designed by the instantly recognizable Portland, Ore., poster artist Casey Burns-- hardly mentions the anniversary. In fact, the label's name takes a smaller font than not only the bands included, like Sonic Youth and Sun City Girls, but also Burns himself. Inside, during an interview with Pitchfork contributor Marc Masters, label owner Cory Rayborn doesn't talk much about his happenstance journey into owning a label (he started it to release one Bardo Pond 10"") or the stylistic confines of Three Lobed (from broken folk to pan-everything psychedelic explorations, there have been none). Rather, he spills his words about the acts involved, calling Steve Gunn ""transformational,"" suggesting Johnny Cash would have covered Wooden Wand, and labeling Mouthus as ""true auteurs."" At least half of Rayborn's own short essay is spent thanking friends and expressing dismay that this is happening. Not the Spaces You Know, But Between Them is less a Three Lobed trademark proclamation than an earnest and excellent offering from one of America's best little labels. Most commemorative compilations like this simply stack a bunch of tracks from catalog artists side-by-side, reprising both the accomplishments of the label in question and offering a few selected gems that either never made it onto a release or have long been out-of-print. But Spaces smartly gives full LP sides to seven bands, essentially affording each act the opportunity to create an EP that's simply part of something bigger. None of this material has ever been released. Considered on its own terms, each contribution from each band is stunning, most often as a summary of what they've done best. Mouthus' two sprawls, for instance, are violent churns of sound, splitting the unexpected distance between industrial music, power electronics, IDM and singer-songwriter fare. A 21-minute, relatively seamless collage of Comets on Fire rehearsals reminds that they’re one of the most ferocious bands of last decade’s psych revival. ""The Invisible Fire"" is one of Bardo Pond's customarily immersive zones, with guitar riffs, electronic whirs, and the alternating flute and contorted moans of Isobel Sollenberger forming a sheet of sound as thick as smoke from a woodland wildfire. And the three live cuts from Sun City Girls, recorded in 2004 at the band's last American show, vividly capture the group's range-- their guitar bravado and brilliance; their mix of country, jazz, rock and Middle Eastern music; their almost-alien intercommunication; their humor; their interesting songs; their interest in exploring those songs' edges through improvisation. But these are all reaffirmations by bands with status to spare: Not the Spaces is, at its best, about future heroes. In the liner notes, Rayborn says that guitarist Gunn doesn't realize ""how ridiculously talented he is."" His ""The Lurker Extended"" is a testament to ambition and narrative, plus a validation of the brilliance Rayborn suggest. Spiraling from slow, graceful licks to variations so fast and frenetic they seem to kick up sparks, Gunn's piece is the kind of statement that should make the unaware place him alongside the best acoustic masters, past and present. The young Pacific Northwest collective Eternal Tapestry has never sounded more forceful and convincing than they do on this alternate take of ""Doing Your Own Being"". With saxophone, bass, and guitars clinched in tidal unison, the band suggests the most triumphant soul-jazz of the 1970s, aggressively recreated by some stoned kids in a basement. D. Charles Speer & the Helix actually split the last side of the third record with Wooden Wand, but their sets are different sides of the same sermon. Led by Dave Shuford of the No-Neck Blues Band, the Helix handles two country classics with a tight grip, giving Gene Clark's end-of-innocence tale ""Shooting Star"" a heartrending, Skynyrd-sized coda. Wooden Wand's three originals are ramshackle country laments, strummed and sighed with threadbare despair. His tunes are written with the same deep-seated gravitas that those Helix covers sport, showing that the blues don't necessarily depend on how they're offered. In his most polished country affectation, Shuford sings, ""It's all very clear/ It's near and then gone."" Wand later slurs an answer, unaware: ""If this is a destination, call it No Survival Drive."" Surprising as it may seem, Sonic Youth supplies this set's most positive, apt metaphor. Lee Ranaldo has released a record through Three Lobed, as has Thurston Moore's side project, Bark Haze. Sonic Youth never has, but Moore's own label, Ecstatic Peace, trades in many of the same circles as Three Lobed. Playfully titled ""In & Out"" and ""Out & In"", Sonic Youth's dual contributions were recorded a decade apart from one another, so Jim O'Rourke-- who plays bass on one song but not the other-- had left the band and so that, after September 11th, they had moved their Echo Canyon studio from New York City to New Jersey. Together, these songs show the band's consistent excellence as patient textural explorers. ""In & Out"" is Sonic Youth at their most tempered; ""Out & In"", the earlier of the pieces, is one of the most ferocious Sonic Youth jams ever put to tape. What begins as a winding, discordant instrumental suddenly finds this three-guitar, five-piece configuration surging with a hardcore-punk intensity. Noise claws at the edges of the relentless beat. They sound scary. The interval between these tracks roughly coincides with Three Lobed's lifespan. Given that Sonic Youth's career was really just starting at the 10-year mark, it serves as a promise of Three Lobed's continued vitality well past this landmark release. And considering the label's mostly spotless résumé and the incredible substance of this commemoration, it's difficult not to hope that suggestion holds true in this often anonymous, unstable industry.","The Three Lobed label celebrates 10 years in business with a comp including unreleased material from Sonic Youth, Sun City Girls, Comets on Fire, and more.

Breaking the Frame,Surgeon,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b075ea9e61561daa6614/1:1/w_160/b5cf6552.jpg,2011-08-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15720-breaking-the-frame/,Dynamic Tension,"Surgeon's DJ mix for Fabric was one of last year's finest, in part because it was so furiously banging, and in part because it captured so elegantly the current zeitgeist for the post-Jeff Mills school of hard-edged minimal techno. Scowling ferociously in the corner, techno seems blessed by its own misanthropy: Never the crossover dance music of choice, it's accorded a certain fearful level of respect and admiration regardless of what might be today's story and (inevitably) yesterday's news. (It's the perennial ""real shit"" for the cognoscenti with a more discerning understanding of the infinite shades of variety afforded by a stoically pummelling kick drum.) Techno seems to be ""back"" at the moment, largely due the partial absorption of dubstep influences into its high-pressure bloodstream, its lacerating percussive attack tending more toward syncopation and snare-heavy swing than in the bad old days of stentorian four-by-four pound. The shift is less one of wholesale transformation than a kind of magnetic realignment, dubstep's clattering and clanking syncopation inspiring a reemphasis of those same qualities always already lurking in techno proper. Breaking the Frame, the first new album from the British producer (real name Anthony Child) in a decade, isn't nearly so gregarious: Surgeon's return to the artist full-length foregrounds the chilly austerity associated with the veteran producer's name throughout the late 1990s. Think of it as the Arctic cousin to the more passionate explosions of Surgeon's DJ mixes, a series of twisted rock formations left behind by the frozen lava of a sweaty night out on the town. But for all that, the album remains bang up to date, with nearly every groove structured around the absent centre of a 4/4 kick drum, that punishing pulsation eschewed in favour of either a halfstep lurch (""Transparent Radiation"", ""Remover of Darkness"") or hectic breakbeat assault (""The Power of Doubt"", ""Radiance""). Only on ""Those Who Do Not""-- by some distance the least memorable moment here-- does Surgeon succumb to the kick-drum's wearied trudge. Almost entirely devoid of anything you might call a tune, Surgeon's productions nonetheless place a high premium on narrative development, plunging from the surface of rigorous acid chugs to clattering rhythmic undercarriages to the rising panic of synthesiser chords so gracefully and organically that the effect is like a microscope training its gaze from the impenetrable solidity of skin to the frenetic molecular activity that secretly comprises it. One can describe these qualities endlessly and barely come closer to pinpointing what it is that makes Breaking the Frame so unexpectedly listenable for the uninitiated: For all that a tune like ""Radiance"" may sound like two continental shelfs grinding past one another, for instance, its forbidding assault is executed with a compositional neatness, clarity, and vibrance that seems to leap out of the speakers. Even more so, the iridescent hum of ""Presence"" glowers and shudders with the compressed heat and intensity of an angry star in the moments before it collapses into a black hole. It's typical on an album whose structures throw shadows of bleak, inhuman grandeur: Enormity, rather than velocity, defines the best work on Breaking the Frame, and there's a masochistic pleasure in being made to feel very small as you lose yourself on the dancefloor.","Surgeon's first album in a decade foregrounds the chilly austerity associated with the veteran British producer's name throughout the late 1990s.

GIVING,Collections of Colonies of Bees,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b074b1335d7bf169a10a/1:1/w_160/c2f3c838.jpg,2011-08-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15718-giving/,Hometapes,"Milwaukee's Collections of Colonies of Bees has been called a side project to Pele, the post-rock band that guitarist Chris Rosenau and drummer Jon Mueller founded in 1997. But those roles look pretty shaky now that Pele is defunct and CCB is still going strong. Founded almost concurrently with Pele, the project began as an outlet to explore folk and bluegrass in a post-rock context, and while its purview quickly expanded, those origins are still vestigial in new album GIVING. They're tangible in the bright banjo plinking behind the guitar cascades of ""Lawns"", and they spiritually inform the conversational disposition of the instruments. Though the songs are as sprawling and segmented as the band's name, CCB brings a touch of relaxed humanity to a style of music that can be unduly grave. While peers such as Explosions in the Sky worship sheer trajectory, CCB seem more interested in the vistas that open up along the way. Downtown minimalism and ambient electronics have become pervasive influences, and during tiered ascents that take in the molten guitar waves of Rhys Chatham (with whom Mueller has worked) and the spectral patterns of Steve Reich, the band often wanders off-course to linger in Eno-inspired electronic wildernesses. Their adventurousness earned them a devoted fanbase, and their stock really took off in 2009, when they hooked up with Justin Vernon to create the widely admired Unmap as Volcano Choir. The four-song, half-hour GIVING is their first new record since then, and finds them saying hello to new fans while bidding goodbye to two outgoing members, Mueller and pianist Thomas Wincek. It feels both triumphal and valedictory, bypassing spacey tangents in favor of CCB's hard-charging live sound. Though GIVING may be an unusually eyes-on-the-prize record for CCB, they still have more in common with questing, omnivorous post-rock bands like Jaga Jazzist than with the single-minded crescendo hunters of the world. Variations of force and expression derive less from rhythmic and harmonic changes than from the accumulation and development of soulful ostinati, woven in and out of freer, more ""rock"" chord progressions. Though a guitar may occasionally break off for an expressive flight of fancy, there's seldom a single musician carrying the moment-- instead, they each lean into repetitive fragments that gradually coalesce into organic, blossoming wholes. At the deepest level, a collectivist honeycomb pattern prevails, and the one-note lead seared across alternating bars of the crunchy climax of ""Vorm"" is the closest thing you'll hear to a killer solo. This is rock music that has come almost completely unstuck from the blues, with a sleek, relentless drive subbing in for swing. Mueller's almost motorik-style percussion sows accents in the intricate layers of pattern, so that similar instrumental passages take on different feelings of loping, staggering, or soaring. Still, it doesn't quite save the album from a somewhat monolithic quality, which is clearly intentional but can be a trifle wearisome. ""Lawn"" is the obvious anthem; ""Vorm"" is bucolic and churning; ""Lawns"" is moodier; and ""Vorms"" is the rangy epic. These cosmetic adjustments to one hypnotically bruising ideal only go so far, and if you're not in the mood to hear dudes being really stoked about their guitar playing, it can make for a long half-hour. But all in all, it's an exciting victory lap for a band whose confidence is highly palpable in this hard-earned moment of high visibility.","The expansive Wisconsin band says goodbye to two members and hello to new fans with these triumphal, hard-charging post-Volcano Choir recordings.

Bad Vibes,Shlohmo,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05bc0084474cd0c1c28/1:1/w_160/fc8fc6d7.jpg,2011-08-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15698-bad-vibes/,Friends of Friends,"Establishing a sonic personality without lyrical assistance or some unique personal backstory can be tricky, especially when you're in the middle of a room crowded with your peers. The space in question is the one with a ""for fans of Flying Lotus"" sign posted over the door, and there hasn't been a ton of vacancy in there lately. Those who've broken out have done so by tweaking the sonic imprint of decaying beats and melting analog chords until they come across as distinctly tactile things, humid and slippery, blown-out and elastic. Reaching out to clutch the music on Shlohmo's Bad Vibes might cause it to crumble in your grasp-- and then cut the hell out of your fingers. The L.A. producer's sophomore full-length comes after a handful of singles, EPs, remixes, and compilation appearances, as well as last year's disorienting debut, Shlomoshun Deluxe. And in that short yet busy time, Shlohmo has dredged up something strange: an aesthetic that's jaggedly delicate, filled with melodic beauty but jostled by abrasive percussive hitches, undercut with sandpapery patches of ambient fuzz. It's a deft merging of gentle, wafting electronic tones and intricately beat-to-shit rhythmic atmosphere, the sounds of old technology trying to reconcile its former gloss with its fading functionality. The cynical ears that still can't get past the nostalgic surface of chillwave might have their own bone to pick with the cassette-deck/VHS fidelity of Bad Vibes, which stands out pretty prominently in hissy tracks like ""Same Time"" and ""Parties"". But instead of celebrating corroded, neon-pastel magnetic-tape detritus for its own sake, the music on this album leans closer to an appreciation of the actual rhythmic counterpoints, quirks, and resonant qualities of white noise. Alongside the moments that seem to revel in the flutter and crackle of old equipment are stretches that draw similar vibes from the sound of literal rainfall (""Seriously"") or birdcall-strewn field recordings (""Big Feelings"")-- not to mention the texture you can get from good old-fashioned feedback, like the keyboard squall of ""Trapped in a Burning House"". The beats themselves are striking enough, whether they're the distant trickling clicks of ""Sink"" or the sharp, crisp snap-thump grooves that push along cuts like ""Places"" or ""Same Time"". Yet even the moments where the beat feels secondary to the other instrumentation have a pulse to them, run through floaty guitars or humming synthesizers that converse with the ambient hiss in compelling ways. Still, neither the melody nor the ambience overwhelms the other. It's easy to hear the silky, billowy tones through the dying-battery distortion, but hard to picture what they'd sound like without it.","The L.A. producer's second LP dredges up a jaggedly delicate sound that merges gently wafting electronic tones with intricately decaying rhythmic atmosphere.

We credit or debit him to varying extents for being brave/gross enough to make an album about statutory rape or a song about incest with his very young daughter, for being a lover to both Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin (and using the opportunities to make innovatively raunchy music), for making an ass of himself on European talk shows in the 1980s, for being unapologetic about all of this. He is, in effect, reduced to a whispering, occasionally drunk lothario by people who don't speak French, his often brilliant wordplay and punning sense of humor hidden behind a language barrier. His musical innovation? Often not discussed at all. The simple fact is that most of his work remains obscure outside of France. It's only when you pull back from ""Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus"" and Melody Nelson and look at his entire career that it becomes apparent how massively influential he was to the body of French song. He started out in the late 1950s making records backed by Alain Goraguer and his orchestra in a style that was little different from the modern chanson that dominated French music in the mid-20th century, but he very quickly began to incorporate elements of American bebop and cool jazz, the first of many such stylistic deviations that helped form the landscape upon which modern French pop and rock grew. In 1964 Gainsbourg was well-known but still not the giant he was to become. His first brush with major controversy-- France Gall's risqué Gainsbourg-penned hit ""Les Sucettes""-- was still two years away. The Serge that English speakers tend to know hadn't been invented. Gainsbourg was working then on more purely musical inventions, and Percussions is an invention of sorts. It's not the first album to directly merge Latin American and African music with Western song styles, but it was unique at the time for the way it did it, essentially grafting chanson onto African and Latin drum patterns and choral styles to create one of the earliest ethno-beat records. Think of it as an ancestor of Paul Simon's Graceland, a record whose approach to mixing African music and Western song is quite similar. Gainsbourg didn't take an entirely hard road to this fusion. Three of the album's songs, ""Joanna"", ""New York, U.S.A."", and ""Marabout"" are built directly on carbon copies of songs from Babatunde Olatunji's 1959 Drums of Passion LP, with the Nigerian chants replaced by French lyrics and Gainsbourg's new melodies and verses laid over the top. This theft is not hidden at all-- it's totally obvious to anyone familiar with Drums of Passion-- though no credit was given to the source. France was just then beginning to close its Colonial chapter, so the idea of a French musician co-opting the music of a Nigerian drummer for his own purposes certainly has an element of ugliness. That said, I suspect Gainsbourg knew some people would spot the lifts, and I think in a way he hoped they would: Across the LP's 12 tracks, he makes no audible attempt to sanitize the African, Brazilian, Caribbean, and bebop rhythms at the heart of the songs, the direct theft functioning somewhat like a coded announcement of their authenticity. On ""Les Sambassadeurs"", Gainsbourg does samba so effectively that the difference between his version and the real thing is mostly one of language and instrumentation (I think the tuba completes a pun in the lyrics). If we explore the album for insight into Gainsbourg's thought process while he was making it, a definite (and rather anti-colonial) theme of embracing people across race lines emerges. ""Couleur Café"" does this directly with its declaration of ""I love your coffee-colored skin."" It sounds sort of unremarkable-- and maybe even condescending or at least un-PC now-- but in its day, it would have been a provocative sentiment to the exact people Gainsbourg liked to needle. For all the ethical ambiguity surrounding its creation (in this way it's similar to Paul Simon's Graceland), Percussions is still a very powerful record. Discounting even its musical concept, it is an uncommonly cohesive and consistently great LP for 1964. It is beautifully recorded, too. The female choirs backing Gainsbourg are vividly captured and lively, the percussion tracks have unusually sonorous low-end (they sound especially good on this vinyl reissue), and the guitar sound on ""Ces Petit Riens"" is uncannily modern. This is something Gainsbourg doesn't get nearly enough credit for-- outside of its sometimes outrageous content, his music was always progressive, and he never was content to stay in one place for too long. This is one reason he never created another LP like Percussions. He came closest on the two reggae LPs he did in Jamaica with Sly & Robbie in the late 1970s and early 80s, but even those lack the Percussions' accessibly experimental scope and cultural curiosity. In 1965, France Gall won the Eurovision Song Contest for Luxembourg with ""Poupée de cire, poupée de son"", a song written by Gainsbourg. It elevated him to another plane of fame, one where he couldn't make an album as casually innovative as Percussions and remain under the radar. Instead, he pointed himself elsewhere musically and became the Serge we know best. On Percussions, though, we can hear the Serge that the salacious details sometimes obscure, the musical experimenter hungry for new sounds, out in the open, innovating if not inventing.","On Serge Gainsbourg's 1964 African-and-Latin-inspired Percussions, we hear the innovative artist that the salacious details sometimes obscure.

Watch the Throne,JAY-ZKanye West,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07b5e6ef95969321f92/1:1/w_160/f2a3e6f6.jpg,2011-08-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/,Def JamRoc-A-FellaRoc Nation,"Watch the Throne features the following things: absurdly expensive samples, a pair of choruses from Odd Future R&B singer Frank Ocean at the exact moment where he's turning the corner and becoming a Thing, another chorus from long-been-a-Thing Beyoncé, a buddy-buddy shoutout to the President of the United States, multiple namechecks of brands so expensive that you've probably never heard of half of them, a murderers' row of producers working on almost every track, and a fleeting moment where Bon Iver's Justin Vernon sounds like the funkiest man alive. And yet for Jay-Z and Kanye West, this could actually be viewed as a relatively minor album. Amazing. The album comes hot on the heels of career-landmark albums from both artists, but the few months they spent recording it on multiple continents were practically vacations compared to the way they usually work. Kanye's opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, still less than a year old, won across-the-board critical raves for its lush, prog-rap expansiveness; to create it, Kanye sequestered himself in Hawaii and flew in an endless stream of creative-peak collaborators. Jay, meanwhile, is still cruising on the momentum of The Blueprint 3, an artistically flat but commercially massive grab for continued relevance that did everything he wanted it to do. Watch the Throne brings little of Twisted Fantasy's boundary-melting ambition or The Blueprint 3's commercial acumen. It's just two of rap's biggest figures and best friends getting together to make some of the swollen, epic music that comes so naturally to them. Listening to it is sort of like watching George Clooney get all his movie-star friends together for a party at his Italian villa, and, along the way, maybe dream up Ocean's Twelve. (I liked Ocean's Twelve.) In the past week, Internet sleuths have pointed out that the release of many Jay-Z albums have coincided with some national or international calamity, 9/11 not excluded. Watch the Throne is no exception: its release on the same day as yet another catastrophic stock market downturn has led some critics to conclude that the pair's boasts of obscene wealth is out of step with the times. That's a fair case to make. But one of the striking things about Watch the Throne is how often Jay and Kanye address matters beyond their bank accounts. On ""Why I Love You"", it's Jay's dismay at past crewmates' betrayals. On ""Murder to Excellence"", it's black-on-black crime and the scarcity of people of color at society's highest seats. On ""Made in America"", it's the hardships of youth and coming of age. ""New Day"" is framed as a letter to the pair's imagined sons, a device that mostly gives them a chance to soul-search and self-criticize. On ""Welcome to the Jungle"", Jay, never a tortured pop star, actually says, ""I'm fuckin' depressed."" Despite all the triumphant bravado these two bring to practically everything they do, they work overtime here to bring a sense of empathy to this enterprise. Once in a while, they even sound vaguely humble. These subtler moments are admirable, but they don't always work. Consider, for example, the song ""That's My Bitch"", on which Kanye and his collaborators flip the classic ""Apache"" break into a devastating dance-rap monster with synths zooming off in every direction and Justin Vernon making the aforementioned sweaty soul moves. It's a vicious song, catchy as fuck, but it turns out to be weirdly awkward. Despite the title, Jay's verse is all devotional-prophet; it mostly concerns the way American beauty standards so often work against women of color. The sentiment deserves respect, but his laidback delivery, on a track with production and structure that call for ferocity, drains his ideas of force. Watch the Throne works best when Jay and Kanye are just talking about how great they are. The single ""Otis"" is dizzy fun, with Jay and Kanye rapping hard and swapping mics like hungry kids. ""Niggas in Paris"" rides an impossibly propulsive synth riff and gigantic drums and gives Jay a chance to display the technical rap wizardry he still has in him. (It also features this great Kanye moment, ""Doctors say I'm the illest because I'm suffering from realness/ Got my niggas in Paris, and they going gorillas,"" followed by a sample of Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory talking about how awesome shit doesn't have to mean anything.) ""Gotta Have It"" unites Kanye and the Neptunes to crazily chop up James Brown vocal samples and Eastern flute melodies. And ""Who Gon Stop Me"" finds Kanye cussing in Pig Latin while turning dubstep-rap into a viable subgenre. If you buy Watch the Throne from iTunes-- the only place you can buy it at the moment-- you'll notice that it's credited to ""JAY Z & Kanye West"" (capital letters and missing hyphen unexplained). But while Jay might be billed first for seniority's sake, Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force. Throughout, he displays levels of unequaled audacity. On ""Otis"" and ""Gotta Have It"", he reduces Otis Redding and James Brown to simple grunts, then builds rhythm tracks out of them. On ""New Day"", over a beat co-produced by RZA, he actually runs Nina Simone through Auto-Tune. On ""No Church in the Wild"", he authoritatively vows, ""You will not control the threesome."" The musical scope of Watch the Throne is a tribute to his distinctive taste and sense of style. The whole thing sounds huge, and even the sillier moments (""Made in America"", especially, reminds me of the inspirational ballads of late-period Michael Jackson) succeed on pure orchestral excess. Jay and Kanye debuted the album in a private listening session at a New York planetarium, a setting which made perfect sense: even if it never approaches the grandeur or character-study complexity of Twisted Fantasy, this is still exploding-star music. So: two long-reigning titans make a relatively quick album which, despite their best efforts, still winds up being a monument to their own grandiosity. Should we care? Well, yeah. Kanye doesn't have a cruise-control switch, and when he's around, neither does Jay. On Watch the Throne, they push each other and have fun doing it, and the result is a stadium-sized event-rap spectacle that still sounds like two insanely talented guys' idiosyncratic vision. That's worth celebrating.","Maybe you've heard of this one? This meeting of two long-reigning titans is the kind of stadium-sized event-rap spectacle we don't get often enough.

Cult of Youth,Cult of Youth,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b072ea9e61561daa660f/1:1/w_160/30a45822.jpg,2011-08-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15719-cult-of-youth/,Sacred Bones,"Cult of Youth's eponymous LP is the group's second full-length, but it might be better (especially for newcomers) to treat it as a debut. For one, it's their first album as an honest-to-goodness group: previous Cult of Youth recordings (including the official full-length debut, Dais Records' A Stick to Bind, a Seed to Grow, currently out-of-print) were exclusively the work of frontman Sean Ragon. On these earlier works, Ragon didn't invite comparisons to neofolk progenitors like Death in June and Current 93 so much as demand them. The combination of Ragon's strident and sepulchral vocals -- which could bear a striking resemblance to those of Swans' Michael Gira-- with vigorously-strummed acoustic guitars and semi-industrial backing beats often made for an arresting experience, but even those attuned to Ragon's particular wavelength might find the original version of Cult of Youth hard to take for more than a few songs at a time. The four-person configuration presented on Cult of Youth goes a long way toward smoothing over those rough edges. During the album's first few tracks, it sounds like Ragon's simply found a way to successfully translate his previous work to a full-band setting. As the album progresses, though, it becomes clearer that this version of Cult of Youth (with the help of producer Chris Coady) has taken on an air associated with that small bundle of first-wave post-punk groups who opted to account for more rustic musics within their angles: think pre-Breakfast Club Simple Minds and (especially on ""Through the Fear"") or ""Cattle and Cane""-era Go-Betweens. Replace Ragon's indomitable vocal presence on a song like ""Casting Thorns"" or ""Weary"" with a more soothing presence-- Marissa Nadler or Alela Diane, for example-- and you might think those songwriters were the ones responsible for writing the track. The updated, re-recorded version of A Stick to Bind track ""Cold Black Earth"" provides a perfect contrast between Cult of Youth's past and present. Originally, the song featured a multi-tracked Ragon bellowing the would-be anthem in a stiff and martial fashion, accompanied only by guitar and bass. On the new album, the track is given a propulsive rolling drum beat, which inspires Ragon (now singing by himself) to speed up his pace and lighten his touch. The addition of well-placed violin flurries (courtesy of Zola Jesus string arranger/full-time Cult member Christiana Key) also helps, turning a lugubrious dirge into something much more spry and palatable. However, those afraid Ragon has lost his edge amidst these more flattering surroundings don't need to worry: If anything, as his unhinged performances on ""The Dead Sea"" and ""Weary"" illustrate, he's more willing to risk absurdity as a vocalist now that he has a more robust musical backing to soften the blows. That goes double for Ragon and friends as musicians: It's hard to not listen to the band take the ""The Lamb"" from its modest acoustic introduction to its expansive semi-psychedelic end and think of what Cult of Youth could accomplish once they reconvene to make their second album.","Cult of Youth's rollicking eponymous LP is the charismatic post-punk group's second full-length, but it might be better to treat it as a debut.

Love Has Made Me Stronger,Carol Kleyn,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02d13d197565213a409/1:1/w_160/0d4e2a93.jpg,2011-08-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15659-love-has-made-me-stronger/,Drag City,"The liner notes to this reissue of hippie harpist Carol Kleyn's 1976 debut would make a great period film, perhaps with Zoe Kazan in the lead. In prose that evokes a sense of discovery and excitement, Kleyn describes her introduction to the counterculture as a freshman at UC Santa Barbara, where she wrote songs for her poetry class before dropping out to concentrate on music full-time. Kleyn shacked up with one-man psychedelic band Bobby Brown, who brought her a harp for her birthday one year. Rather than take lessons at the university, she taught herself to play the instrument and promised to perform her own songs exclusively. Soon she was lugging that harp-- which was nearly as big as she was-- in and out of buses, down streets and alleyways, and across fields to busk for passersby at street corners, community fairs, and Renaissance festivals all over California. This musical coming-of-age story eventually becomes a Zelig-style romp through 1970s pop culture, as Kleyn toured with Gregg Allman and hobnobbed with the Eagles, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli, and Sly Stone, among many other contemporaries. She came close to signing with a label, specifically Allman home base Capricorn, but instead she released three self-funded albums on her own. Rather than achieve success as defined by the music industry, Kleyn went on to become a legend among crate diggers and harp-folk enthusiasts. The twist ending: Reading these liner notes, it's clear Kleyn prefers her relative anonymity to anything else that might have been. The epilogue: More than three decades after self-releasing her debut, Kleyn signed her first record deal with Drag City, which means she now shares a label with that other indie harpist, Joanna Newsom. Kleyn's first proper release is this reissue of Love Has Made Me Stronger, a collection of original songs that translate strummed hippie folk music to the plucks and glissandi of the harp. It's a product of its time and place, made by a social and musical free spirit who gently tested the strictures of West Coast pop music not only in her choice of instrument but also in her relentlessly sunny disposition. This is the sort of album you might identify with Laurel Canyon in the late 60s, not with the post-Watergate bicentennial. In 2011, that mountain child sensibility may seem a little naïve, especially when Kleyn sings, ""Come on, let's sing the world a love song,"" on ""Blackbird"", before performing a hiccupping imitation of birdsong. And yet, that performance-- which sounds like Buddy Holly at a commune-- is so whimsical as to be both endearing and commanding. Love Has Made Me Stronger is fascinating as a pop artifact that's more extroverted than Vashti Bunyan's Just Another Diamond Day and more insular than Judee Sill's Heart Food, but its true impact derives from the sheer force of Kleyn's personality, which makes hippie cheer feel brave. Kleyn displays an intriguing cross section of styles and influences, a range that ostensibly results from her being self-taught. She strums and picks her harp like a guitar on ""Baby Come Close"" and ""Love's Goin' Round"", and on ""Street Song"", she plays the instrument almost like a dulcimer, percussively plucking countermelodies that sound both tender and slightly foreboding. When Kleyn trades the harp for keys on the album's second half, however, she loses some of what makes her distinctive. On songs like ""Well Glory Be"" and ""You Know I Love You"", Kleyn's keyboard playing is more rudimentary than inventive, more technically constrained than artistically free. More often, though, Love Has Made Me Stronger's rough-around-the-edges imperfections only allow Kleyn to convey her spirited optimism all the more forcefully. That sort of music boldness never goes out of style.","More than three decades after self-releasing her debut, the hippie harpist signed her first record deal for this Drag City reissue.

Ghosts Outside,Steve MasonDennis Bovell,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b064c0084474cd0c1c3a/1:1/w_160/22534a46.jpg,2011-08-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15704-ghosts-outside/,Double Six,"Steve Mason is always in a state of transition. The Beta Band, destined for both greatness and record sales, found label trouble and wrote a white-boy rap so terrible that people remember it. They were constantly about to peak until they were obviously releasing post-peak albums. When Mason's post-Beta King Biscuit Time work (and his album as Black Affair) failed to catch on, he disappeared and fans worried for his mental health. He was rumored to be in debt. His career, his life even, began to resemble his voice: wispy, elusive, sad. Last year's Boys Outside, Mason's first album under his own name, was the first Mason product to suggest stability. A blanched, graceful folk-rock album, it was placid like a heart trauma victim begged by his family to settle down for the good of his health. I mean this musically: Mason's track record on his most spastic work is spotty. He returns to this material on Ghosts Outside, working with UK-based dub veteran Dennis Bovell (whose previous production credits include Mason-friendly touchstones like the Pop Group and Orange Juice) to re-work Boys Outside's 10 tracks into classically echoing dub pop. Anyone waiting for a playful, Mason-esque twist can stop. Ghosts Outside is a sober, catholic dub remix album: one new mix for each track, re-branded with a ""dub"" title (e.g. ""Hound on My Heel"" is now ""Dub on My Heel"", ""Am I Just a Man"" now ""Dub I Just a Man""). Mason was one of the late-90s pop chameleons, so he's no stranger to Reggae and dub music (a personal favorite), but Ghosts Outside represents the first time he has lain himself prostrate before a genre. Possibly in deference to Bovell, possibly because Ghosts Outside is an exercise as much as it is an album, Mason has no interest in coloring outside the lines. Still, there are gains to be had. Dub is the rare technique that feels both transgressive and cliché, and it fills both roles here. Bovell scatters Mason's vocals, which untether his songs in interesting ways. ""The Letter"", so deliberate in Mason's hands, stalks aimlessly under Bovell, its chorus suddenly ascendant. Bovell's treatments cause the song structures to dissipate but stratify the productions, providing layers through which Mason's voice filters (a crucial function of the best Beta Band compositions). The robust horn charts of ""Lost and Dub"" and especially ""Yesterday Dub"" swallow Mason whole and provide a rigid counterpoint to his gummy croon. While I wish Mason and Bovell had found a way to do this without resorting to the trope-iest of dub tropes-- chirpy guitar chords, reflective drums, pliable basslines-- the effect is, at times, enlightening. The Mason Fan Club (we meet Wednesdays at 7; dues are collected quarterly) will want this. It is novel, in its way: Mason, who once seemed capable of inventing a new genre with each track, reverently bowed before dub reggae, a staple fetish of Western European pop (see also: Serge Gainsbourg, the Clash, the Police). You're forgiven if you find the idea underwhelming, but it wasn't so long ago that the prospect of any new Mason material seemed doubtful. He's returned, calmer, still exploring, but doing so carefully.","The onetime Beta Band vocalist reworks last year's solo folk-rock effort Boys Outside with the help of UK-based dub veteran Dennis Bovell.

Rapper/producer Oh No is the younger brother of California backpack-rap overlord Madlib and a restless stoner-rap mind in his own right; he's fond of crazy undertakings like releasing an entire album where he only samples Greek and Middle Eastern psych-pop. Together, Alchemist and Oh No linked up last year to form a duo named Gangrene and to release the underrated Gutter Water album, a dizzy pileup of broken-sounding samples and willfully disgusting sound-clips. Rapper/producer Roc Marciano, meanwhile, is a 1990s-era Queens holdover and a veteran of Busta Rhymes' Flipmode Squad. Last year, he released the excellently dense and grimy self-produced solo album Marcberg, a welcome reminder that there's still life in the old Carhart-and-Tims Mobb Deep model. On their own, these guys are all cranking out impressive work that happily exists within a long, proud backpack-rap lineage without ever really reaching toward larger audiences. And right now, both Gangrene and Roc Marci are labelmates; all three guys are on Decon Records. So really, it just makes sense to put all three together onto an EP, letting them all rap over each other's beats and seeing what happens. Greneberg-- its title an amalgam of Gangrene and Marcberg-- is a jumbled pileup of three talented artists who all exist on the same wavelength. It's a split EP, with Roc handling the first three tracks and Gangrene doing the next three. But it's also a collaboration, as all these guys flit in and out of each other's tracks, contributing beats or verses where needed. ""Don't give a fuck about the current direction of rap,"" says Alchemist on ""Sewer Gravy""-- a bold statement from a guy who still works as Eminem's tour DJ. But the quote holds true, since these guys basically combine to form their own aesthetic universe. In this trio's vision of rap, choruses never need to show up, and beats sputter and ripple as often as they thump. The production on Greneberg sounds like what might happen if you threw late-1960s soul and psych into a malfunctioning blender; it's a beguiling fog of horn-stabs and organ sighs and guitar flutters. It sounds chaotic, and that's fine, since the three rappers sound most at home in chaos of their own making. The EP works best when Roc Marciano is rapping; his threats pack a whole lot of lyrical inventiveness into a few terse, sneery lines. On ""Jet Luggage"": ""Dress spiffy/ Finesse the Mac-11 out the Dickie/ Let off a dozen rounds into ya Crown Vicky."" On ""Momma Told Me"": ""My discography's godly/ Biters copy while I pull one out the crime rhyme glossary/ Before I pop your meat like Luca Brasi."" Oh No and Alchemist can't compete with that, but they try, and it's fun to hear their attempts. (Alc on ""New Shit"": ""Rockin' a jamboree, Barry Manilow piano man/ Freely perform compositions randomly."") And even when the verses don't click, it's worth it to hear all three producers push their vision of what rap is to its logical extreme. This is some hard, dusty, uncompromising underground rap, and there's always room for some of that.","On the Greneberg EP, three talented artists (Roc Marciano, Alchemist, and Oh No) create hard, dusty, uncompromising, chaotic underground rap.

Family of Love EP,DoM ,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0619d034d5c69bf4877/1:1/w_160/55a358df.jpg,2011-08-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15707-family-of-love-ep/,Astralwerks,"At first glance, Dom don't come across as particularly ambitious. During our Rising interview with the Worcester indie-pop outfit last year, their eponymous frontman mentioned that one of the benefits of living in the Massachusetts town was the lax laws on weed possession. About a month later, they put an ad on Craigslist for what essentially sounded like a band babysitter. In the year and a half leading up to Dom's second EP, Family of Love, they released their debut Sun Bronzed Greek Gods EP twice, the most recent reissue coming from big-dog label Astralwerks. If you didn't get the idea from the bratty, debauched video for ""Living in America"" (again, the second clip for the song in less than a year's time), the story about how Dom (the person, and band frontman) got lost on tour while tripping on ecstasy should clue you in to how these guys like spending their time. So, yeah, not exactly the picture of industriousness, these ones, which also means Family of Love's brevity-- five songs in just under 17 minutes-- doesn't exactly encourage high expectations out of the gate. The real (and very welcome) shock, then, is how well-honed those five songs sound. This stuff is packed with detail, both silly (the telephone keypad solo on ""Telephone"") and ambitious (""Damn""'s sea of golden guitar lines). A few songs bleed into each other, like parts of a larger whole; the album's most straightforward synth-pop cut, ""Happy Birthday Party"", dissolves into rumpled noise and fluttering flutes towards its close. These are rich, dense-sounding compositions. The element that makes Family of Love sound like the work of an almost entirely different band is the massive leap in production value. For all its pop acumen, the stumbling point of the homespun Sun Bronzed Greek Gods EP was its scrappy, waterlogged sound, which emphasized the band's juvenile delinquencies at the expense of showcasing the songwriting. This time around, Dom worked with reputed producer Nicholas Vernhes in his NYC-based Rare Book Room studio. His touch lends these slyly complicated pop confections the expansive treatment they clearly deserve, turning the aqueous title track into a stretchy jam reminiscent of the sophistipop outfit Sea and Cake (a band that I would have never thought I'd compare Dom to, but there you go). It's tantalizing to imagine how Dom's previous work would sound through this airy filter-- throwing on Sun Bronzed Greek Gods after listening to this one definitely does the former a disservice. The improved fidelity also helps with understanding the lyrics. ""Telephone"" turns a simple cellular connection into something between eroticism and euphoria (""I come alive when you pick up the line""), while ""Damn"" expounds on the malevolent self-centered attitude previously explored on ""Burn Bridges"". Potential suitors are tossed aside for the one that got away (and, seemingly, isn't coming back) in the balmy, bar-piano jaunt ""Some Boys"", which features fellow one-name guest vocalist Emma and works much better than the band's last tepid experiment with outside vocals, ""Bowl Cut"", with Cults' Madeline Follin. Most emotionally revealing, though, is the EP's floaty title track, which eschews problems of the heart for sentiments on protection and safety through friendship. As is lore, Dom's frontman grew up as an orphan and spent most of his adolescence bouncing around foster homes; ""Family of Love"" is the first time that he's let the sugary facade crack to reveal his own battered beginnings, as well as his wish for a better, more stable life. On the other end of the spectrum is ""Happy Birthday Party"", a call back to the synth-pop glories of their previous work and a silly natal-fixated trifle that will most likely end up soundtracking an episode of iCarly in the near future. The song is goofy and sort of disposable (catchy as hell, too), but it makes perfect sense, since Dom are prone to acting out whenever they can. Living forever is a desire often explored in pop music; I'm not sure that the boys in Dom want to exist for eternity-- if they keep behaving the way that they allegedly do, they won't even come close-- but they're clearly set on making the most of their time while they're here.","For their second EP, Worcester's favorite indie-pop slackers hand in a surprisingly ambitious, detail-packed, Nicholas Vernhes-produced collection.

Forever Dolphin Love,Connan Mockasin,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07013d197565213a481/1:1/w_160/272af227.jpg,2011-08-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15716-forever-dolphin-love/,BecausePhantasy,"Young New Zealander Connan Mockasin's low-wattage, shuffle-footed, hypna-delic kiwi-pop's a little like shaking Syd Barrett awake from a nap, or maybe Tortoise jamming on Chills songs underwater. Or is it Black Moth Super Rainbow's Haunted Graffiti? Tricky as it is to pinpoint just what's sliding past in Forever Dolphin Love's psyche-mining slipstreams, it's awfully easy to get caught up in its current all the same. Mockasin's languid, drowsy psych-whimsy-- with its occasional brain-bending detours into a self-made language, more Sigur Rós goobledigook than WU LYF cookie monstrism-- seems to emerge from a gauzy dreamland state, only semi-conscious of its constantly shifting positions. But if you don't come to Connan Mockasin expecting too much pep the first few minutes he's up and going, the gears eventually start to turn. Forever Dolphin Love opens with a gaggle of children shouting salutations at Mockasin: It is, by some distance, the loudest sound on the LP. The stark, almost gestural tunes, Mockasin's wiggly, high-pitched vocals-- whether slathered in Tobacco-style smear or unadorned-- and the record's murky, two-floors-up mix don't exactly get the heart rate rising, but Mockasin's ease around both hooks and arrangements offer plenty to catch your half-attention. Its spindly guitars and squirmy vocals suggest nobody's in any particular hurry to get anyplace, yet Forever Dolphin Love's drifty hooks, when he gets around to them, never seem to wander too far off course. (Once awoken by those kiddies in the record's first few seconds, Mockasin may be a bit crust-eyed throughout Forever Dolphin Love, but he's always got his wits about him.) Opener ""Megumi the Milkyway Above"" is something of a slacker samba, its gently descending melody and chipmunk vocals beamed directly from Mockasin's subconscious to yours. It slides into the untethered, almost subliminal ""It's Choade My Dear"": Half-travelogue, half-come on, the tune wafts its way into the room and seems to hang there like a fog. Mockasin's oft-treated, clarity-averse, dare-I-say-wimpy vocals swallow syllables whole, further lending these slippery, spacious tracks their dreamlike quality. It's probably best, all told, that literal meaning takes a backseat to glorious nonsense on a record called Forever Dolphin Love. To that end, the title track-- all 10 minutes and four seconds of it-- is the album's deliriously comatose highlight, a rusty motorik giving way to a kooky, faux-naif, head-sticking hook. An occasional semi-Floydian found-sound burst swirls around the stereo field: The almost skeletal arrangements occasionally give way to a jazz-rock flare-up, but these eyelid flickers never seem to disturb Mockasin's semi-conscious state. Dolphin glides casually through song and snippet, its construction almost elliptical, its effect amniotic. As such, its highlights seem to emerge after-the-fact, burrowing in while it's on and bubbling up later. Mockasin's a more ambitious songwriter than his sleepy demeanor would sometimes suggest, though-- the epic unravel of his tracks are proof enough of that. Ultimately, the ever-unraveling, mind-submerged Forever Dolphin Love reveals itself to be the work of a guy who's sounding small but dreaming big.","Young hypna-delic New Zealander Connan Mockasin's languid, mind-submerged Forever Dolphin Love is the work of someone sounding small but dreaming big.

Response,Dave.I.D,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06613d197565213a46c/1:1/w_160/2787cd83.jpg,2011-08-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15709-response/,!K7,"Incognito's not what it used to be. When Burial kickstarted the trend a few years ago, secrecy felt more like an apt conceptual frame for his bodiless music than a gimmick, and investigative journalism was necessary to finally reveal his name. We bloggers and writers, it turned out, were endlessly tantalized by this austere modesty, and what began as an inevitable reaction to a culture of online oversharing currently verges on being a stock marketing strategy, to be cast off as soon as it gets the job done. You can now visit Pitchfork and read delightfully paradoxical headlines like ""WU LYF Talk Mystique."" Meanwhile, newcomer Dave.I.D makes his quasi-anonymous peers seem like Jandek by comparison. Google around and you'll be amazed by the number of articles that trumpet the one-man-band's impregnable anonymity before revealing his location (South London), his birth name (David Andrew Hedges), his former profession (accounting), his recording digs (some kind of arty wooden box), his face (half-masked), his influences (everything from Liars to Chris & Cosey), details of his personality and process-- shit, I have uncles I know less about than Dave.I.D. But he claims that he was never trying to be a mystery man anyway. ""It's just because I'm not famous,"" he insisted during a Quietus interview, in the enigmatic venue of a Dalston pub. Apparently, failing to aggressively market yourself is now tantamount to stealth. There's no cultivated air of circumspection around Dave's music either. Response, following up on the Gangs EP, is a visceral work of raw crimson emotion and apocalyptic drama. It features dense, jaggedly careening electronic rock laced with industrial heaviness, post-punk serration, and proggy pretenses, as if TV on the Radio, Einstürzende Neubauten, PiL, and the Mars Volta had formed a Voltron-like juggernaut. Also like TVOTR, the music internally combusts with some kind of demonic conviction. Opener ""When Everything is in its Place"" sets a hulking, gothic synthesizer atop a foundation of echoing thwacks, and the tension between engulfing leads and baroquely bruising percussion hardly relents for the entire album. Dave harnesses his concussive beats, blatting synths, air-raid sirens, and growling guitar chords into a dyspeptic, thrillingly overbearing force. Softer touches like the shivering harpsichord of ""SumR"" and the warmly blurred new wave of ""Oil"" are the exceptions accentuating the rule. Response is essentially loop-based, but feels less like an ""electronic production"" than the unconstrained and spontaneous work of a guy who wanted to make a heady rock epic but couldn't be bothered to collaborate. The firebombed atmosphere and abrading textures first command your attention, but Dave is a songwriter at heart, and melody, however seared and bludgeoned, is his anchor. On the downside, his vocals have petulant undertones that can dilute the dark grandeur of the music with a juvenile tinge. But they grew on me, and work especially well as additional musical grist rather than leads. ""You Me Come For"" starts off as jumbled and juddering as its title, but when it subsides into delicate backdrafts of synthesizer, Dave catches his voice in an unusually soulful refrain of ""please let go"" that cycles chillingly in the air. In this moment, you can feel the full measure of his flaws, his longings, and his uncanny powers: his specific, decidedly non-anonymous humanity.","Quasi-anonymous electro-rock newcomer Dave.I.D's jaggedly careening Response is a visceral work of crimson emotion and apocalyptic drama.

Chill Out Zone,Wiley,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06b13d197565213a477/1:1/w_160/15f40367.jpg,2011-08-09 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15711-chill-out-zone/,Elusive,"For the past few years, Wiley's seemed pretty torn over the direction his career should take. He can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a boisterous patriot for underground UK urban music or a showbiz cat unafraid of his crossover ambitions. On Chill Out Zone's ""If I Could"", he raps about keeping his music raw and personal while still being able to get it into the charts. It's the kind of sentiment you'd expect from a guy who abandoned his major label for a second chance at the indie life, right after his biggest success with ""Wearing My Rolex"", which fell just shy of topping the UK charts in 2008. But it's also kind of hard to square this ""might blow up but won't go pop"" attitude with R&B cat Ed Sheeran mewling pleasantly on the song's chorus, especially when you consider the stark beats and alien basslines that first brought Wiley to fame. Ever since his old crew Roll Deep first flirted with the UK Top Ten in 2005, Wiley's been trying on and off to mix grime's twisted low-end theories with the accessibility of R&B, synth-pop, even music hall comedy. Chill Out Zone is his most blatant attempt yet at blending the rough with the smooth, the grimly reflective and the purely pleasurable. There are some beautiful low-key moments, and a few nods to grime's cybernetic fierceness. But most of these cuts are built around synth hooks as bright and immediate as anything you'll find in the work of 1980s-obsessed house producers like Alan Braxe and Fred Falke, even as the lyrics get seriously, painfully emo at times. It makes for a strange if not always entirely unpleasant mix: soul-searching rap over sugar-coated beats. A self-released EP long enough to really be called an album, it's easy to understand why Big Dada, devoted to left-field tweaks on traditional hip-hop, might not have been interested in Chill Out Zone. Musically it's probably pretty close to the album Wiley's old label, Asylum, was hoping he'd make after See Clear Now, a slick and sumptuous short set of prettified pop tunes. Co-produced by Jay Weathers, the beats on Chill Out Zone are indeed uniformly great. The swoon of ""Get Up"", where they blend the best bits from ambient jungle and synthetic 80s soul music, is as gorgeous a track as any producer's made this year, in any genre. It's just too bad the record's behind-the-boards brilliance is so often obscured by Wiley's surprisingly sluggish rapping and the uniformly lame R&B choruses appended to half the songs. A lot of the zip and wit has always drained out of Wiley's voice when he's decided to get serious. Even when the music's light and airy, too many cuts on Chill Out Zone find him droning on with surprising self-pity about the perils of fame, thwarted success, his hood credentials, and accusations of selling out. With a backing track that resembles late 80s Steve Winwood as much as anything, ""She Might Holla"" is one of the few cuts where Wiley-the-rapper sounds like he's having any fun, like a guy who actually should be rapping over these unabashedly pop beats. As for the guest singers, they range from adequate to grating, but even the decent ones flop because none of their vocal hooks can match the keyboards for exuberance or memorability. For fans and beat freaks, Chill Out Zone is worth snagging for the shimmering backing tracks and the moments when Wiley bothers to come to life behind the mic. But if you're only going to grab one new Wiley album in 2011, the far more committed and energetic 100% Publishing, released just a month ago, is still the one to get.","UK Charts-flirting grime staple Wiley follows recent offering 100% Publishing with a self-released ""EP"" of soul-searching rap over sugar-coated beats.

Our Blood,Richard Buckner,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05eea9e61561daa65f1/1:1/w_160/ea56b15e.jpg,2011-08-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15700-our-blood/,Merge,"The urgency you're bound to hear in Richard Buckner's voice throughout Our Blood isn't accidental. Though he's released an album every year or two during his two-decade career, Our Blood is his first since 2006's Meadow. Because that extended interim wasn't intentional, it was, as you might imagine, extremely frustrating. After Meadow, Buckner stopped writing records to focus on a score for a movie that was never released; after moving to upstate New York, he worked shifts holding signs for Con Edison construction crews and assisting the Census Bureau before turning his focus back toward a proper LP. His tape machine broke, so he lost all his recordings. Then his laptop was stolen, so he lost all of his recordings again. But these restarts proved purposeful: Our Blood is the most concise, driven, and well-considered Buckner album in the last decade, his ruminative prose-poems becoming determined, last-chance exhortations. At one time a major-label musician, the peripatetic Buckner has worked with a staggering cast of stars over the years, from Guided by Voices alumnus Doug Gillard and Tortoise's John McEntire to esteemed fiddler Champ Hood and dobro maestro Lloyd Maines. His plans for Our Blood originally included Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley and some pedal steel, but the sessions were among those stolen. For expediency's sake, Buckner played almost all of Our Blood by himself, at home in Kingston, New York. Calling it spare would hedge on hyperbole, but there is a certain necessity-borne restraint. Rather than create complicated convolutions, organs, electric guitars, electronics, and slight percussion mirror or augment the central themes. This economical approach pushes Buckner's voice into the spotlight, giving him a reason to make every word count-- ""a panicked freshness,"" he told me, describing his own singing here. Buckner's rarely sounded more authoritative and confident. For instance, during the album's masterstroke, ""Escape"", the instrumentation is a central acoustic guitar graced only by a few rudimentary keyboard flourishes. ""Let's waste the night/ Pay the price and get out of here,"" Buckner sings, his room-filling baritone unencumbered by its surroundings as he makes his escapist order. His tone sort of forces you to agree. More or less, Our Blood seems to be an album about making better decisions in adulthood-- learning how to hold a job that doesn't hold you down, discovering how not to let bad friends and bar rooms ruin your life, realizing that the best days deliver something you'd never even considered. Buckner's voice feels experienced and empathetic, then, like a knowing pat on the back from a parent or an old friend that recognizes weakness yet pushes you ahead. He sings of ""shaking in the coldest hours,"" ""forgetting to forgive,"" and being ""caught in the lights, left again,"" like a veteran or a guide. If Our Blood has a fault, it's brevity: Its nine songs (including one slight and predictable instrumental) run only for about 37 minutes. But Buckner's elliptical, impressionistic writing style demands that most of those 37 minutes be heard, studied, and reconsidered. After all, Buckner remains one of the most intriguing songwriters working, using a style that's more likely to show up in anthologies of 20th-century literature than in other Merge Records liner notes. On paper, these tunes are collections of highly punctuated paragraphs (not verses), full of pauses and run-ons and fragments. Diaphanous closer ""Gang"" is a set of two tangled, 70-word questions that beg to be diagrammed; throttled mid-album highlight ""Witness"" mostly forms a spider web of seemingly inconsequential observations, like, ""Sometimes, it would get so cold,"" and ""Leaves, too young to fall."" They're the kinds of phrases that cause the listener to pause mid-song, the rest of it flying by before a meaning's been teased out. These songs store well more than a half-hour of reward and intrigue-- appropriate enough for a record that had to be made three times.","Richard Buckner was forced to make Our Blood-- his most concise, driven, and well-considered album in the last decade-- three times.

It / Freaks / Separations,Pulp,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0689d034d5c69bf4882/1:1/w_160/6adc2af3.jpg,2011-08-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15708-it-freaks-separations/,Fire,"Pulp's announcement of a reunion and return to touring in late 2010 told two lies: first, that it was the original lineup reuniting, and second that they'd be playing songs from every era of the band's career. The current sextet is nowhere close to the original lineup-- 22 other people had to come and go before that group solidified. The setlists from the reunion shows haven't dipped back before 1992. This version of events sets up a narrative that has Pulp arriving fully formed with their last single for Fire Records, 1992's ""Countdown"", and conquering the charts in short order. It glosses over the longer, much more interesting story of the band's origins and lurching path to fame. I'm not saying Pulp ought to be playing songs from their early days in their current shows, and I'm definitely not saying they should have gotten the real original lineup back together, but it seems odd to position the reunion as they have-- it has the effect of disowning the fits and starts of their awkward stage. Perhaps that's their intention, but the band's ignored history won't exactly be buried, because Fire's reissued all of it. The music Pulp made from 1983 to 1992 is in no way on the level of the music they made after that, but you can hear all the seeds of His 'N' Hers and Different Class dropping into place, even as the band digresses and fails. Pulp were formed by Jarvis Cocker and his friend Peter Dalton at the City School in Sheffield in 1978, when the two were in their teens. Dalton was still in the group three years later, when they cut their first Peel Session, a four-song set that shows them torn between hard-edged post-punk and New Wave. Dalton's father forced him to leave the band (he threw a plate of food at him and told him he had to go to university), and by the time Cocker got them signed to Red Rhino and back in the studio, it was 1983 and the band had completely turned over, apart from its gawky front man and drummer Wayne Furniss. The album this version of Pulp recorded, It, almost completely abandons the sound of that first Peel Session in favor of a folkier setup and a generally cheerful disposition. The first thing anyone familiar with classic, 90s Pulp will probably notice while listening to It is that Cocker hadn't yet developed his stage persona. There's no hint of the lasciviousness, class awareness, or cultural appetite that defined his best-known work. As a vocalist, he's adequate but not yet himself as we know him-- basically, he sounds like he listened to the Chameleons a lot. That in mind, It is a nice indie pop record, but the songwriting seams show. For instance, the waltzing ""Joking Aside"" finds him stretching out certain words awkwardly to make the melody more interesting-- it just sounds odd. ""My Lighthouse"", on the other hand, is pretty accomplished, and its turns of phrase point toward what lay ahead. On release, It sank without a trace, but Cocker soldiered on, getting the band signed to Fire Records. Keyboardist Candida Doyle and guitarist/violinist Russell Senior both joined, putting in place part of the classic 90s lineup of the band. On the recordings from 1985 to 1988, you can hear Pulp figuring out the kind of band it wants to be. Freaks, the album they released in 1987, is a 180-degree turn from the happy pastoralism of It, and the pair of EPs and two non-album B-sides gathered on the reissue's bonus disc (which has almost the same track selection as the mid-90s compilation Masters of the Universe) move similarly into the dark. In some ways Cocker seems less certain of the kind of singer he'd like to be than on It. Senior takes lead vocals twice on Freaks and once on a B-side, while Cocker wavers between developing his own identity, imitating Ian Curtis, and trying to beat Mark E. Smith at his own game. He sometimes does this a bit tunelessly. Still, though most of these directions were best abandoned, this is an immensely interesting period for the band, and often an entertaining one. Senior's lead on Freaks opener ""Fairground"" is hilariously demonic, and the band builds a carnival atmosphere around his maniacal laughing. Cocker's unsteady grip on the key of ""Being Followed Home"" is actually an asset, as his flat singing intensifies the paranoia of the lyrics. Getting in key a little more strongly could have made ""I Want You"" Pulp's first big pop moment-- I'd love to hear him sing it today. His Ian Curtis impression on ""Master of the Universe"" is a little painful, but Cocker and the band very nearly equal the Fall at their own game on the eight-minute B-side ""Tunnel"". This material may be uneven, but it points to a band growing more confident and willing to take risks. The failure of Freaks and its satellite singles prompted Cocker to move to London to study film and very nearly ended the band, but he connected with bassist and fan Steve Mackey in London, and Pulp reconvened with the lineup that would finally put them over the top. Mackey's interest in house music rubbed off on Cocker and proved decisive to the sound of their next LP. Separations was recorded between 1989 and 1991 but not released until 1992. In the meantime, two of its songs, ""My Legendary Girlfriend"" and ""Countdown"", had been released as singles, and these afforded them their first significant critical and commercial traction. The first half of Separations frankly sounds like songs the band would have placed on B-sides just two years later-- the sound and feel are there but the tunes largely aren't. Side two, though, is Pulp's long-awaited artistic breakthrough. It begins with ""Countdown"", the band's first full-on foray into disco (or something like it) and also the first prolonged glimpse we get of Cocker at his sexed-up and observational best. ""My Legendary Girlfriend"", which NME made its Single of the Week in early 1991, is even better, foreshadowing the acidic whispered monologues of ""I Spy"" in its icy verses. In four songs (and a couple of bonus B-sides), we hear Pulp reinventing themselves as the band that made His 'N' Hers and Different Class. In spite of its lack of consistency, the LP is worth hearing by fans for that alone. Given that the band is almost entirely ignoring these records in its current reunion, now is as good a time as any to revisit them (or visit them for the first time, as the case may be). They are each flawed in different ways, but at the very end of the chronology the classic Pulp-- the Pulp the band prefers to remember-- emerges, glistening.","Pulp are ignoring the early albums in their reunion, but these recordings from 1983 to 1992 offer an important look at the band's development and reinvention.

Native To,Is Tropical,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05f13d197565213a462/1:1/w_160/4c4abf93.jpg,2011-08-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15702-native-to/,DowntownKitsunéCooperative,"The world of fashion is marked by endless new trends rapidly becoming obsolete, then cycling around again-- that's why it's called fashion. Operating a music label like a fashion line is a dicey proposition-- for every success at merging the two worlds (Fischerspooner, Gaga, Urban Outfitters, Odd Future), there are infinitely more unmemorable attempts. One way to succeed is to stamp your brand on a ton of different things, and count on the fact that the value accrued by the very good outweighs the hits you take from the bad. That's been Kitsuné's goal, it seems, since opening for business in 2002. For a brief minute last decade, it seemed that the label that packaged its first compilation with a pasta recipe was actually going to win the big-club dance music sweepstakes through sheer number of releases alone-- James Murphy, remember, was losing his edge to ""the kids from France""-- but their batting average quickly dipped. By 2007, Pitchfork's Tim Finney could claim the label had experienced ""a meteorite fall-from-grace."" Which brings us to 2011, and Kitsuné's latest attempt to merge the worlds of dance and rock music with London trio Is Tropical. They certainly lean more toward style than substance-- they wear bags over their head in promo photos, their band name and debut album title both sound like they were clipped from the middle of sentences in fashion magazines-- but that doesn't mean there's nothing to like on Native To. Like so many of the incalculable number of beachy New Order re-orderings that've cropped up over the past couple of decades, the album packs a bit of catchy disco slickness (""Lies""), more than a few moments that would work well as jingles for travel adverts (opener ""South Pacific""), and approximations of moody, guitar-heavy Brit rock (""Oranges""). While current American indie artists prefer their surf-and-sand music to echo vague, blurry memories of hitting the beach, Is Tropical aim to pack dancefloors. It's certainly easy to imagine them becoming the next Big UK Band, as well, playing festival gigs and massive club dates and making a fairly good living at it for a few years-- many worse things have happened. ""I'll Take My Chances"" may be a straightforward ditty about going for it with a girl, but it holds the best statement of purpose for the band's M.O. of keeping their music uncluttered and uncomplicated: ""Any idiot knows that simplicity wins."" Indeed, Native To is packed with well-executed, hummable stuff, but it wears thin quickly. To use a style comparison, it's like buying clothes from discount Euro-style mall retailer H&M: They look great on the rack, but you're lucky if they last you through the season.","London trio Is Tropical is fashion-forward French label Kitsuné's latest attempt to merge the worlds of dance and rock music.

As the Crow Flies,The Advisory Circle,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06c5e6ef95969321f7c/1:1/w_160/77b580e8.jpg,2011-08-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15712-as-the-crow-flies/,Ghost Box,"Past recordings by the Advisory Circle sometimes felt like long-lost Cold War transmissions held in reserve in case the British government needed a reason to assure the general public that everything was okay. Jon Brooks, who has functioned under this moniker since the mini-album Mind How You Go in 2005, plugged into the fear and paranoia induced by such declarations. If you feel the need to assure people that everything is alright, they're going to wonder what caused you to tell them that in the first place. Or, as Brooks put it in an interview: ""Everything's fine, but there is something not quite right about it."" Brooks is obsessed with the government-sponsored enmity that flows through many of the public information films (PIFs) Britain produced in the 1970s and 1980s, often recreating the stern, authoritarian tones of their announcers at certain points in his albums. As the Crow Flies, his third record as the Advisory Circle, also begins that way, with a female voice claiming: ""The Advisory Circle. We make the decisions so you don't have to."" Another album modeled on such austerity might feel like Brooks was over-egging an idea that partially helped inspire the hauntology sub-genre. So instead he's slowly evolved the Advisory Circle sound, bringing in acoustic instrumentation to supplement the banks of old analog equipment that remain his primary source tools. This pushes As the Crow Flies a little closer to the kind of darkly pastoral electronic work Boards of Canada were tinkering with on Geogaddi. But this has more conceptual weight than that record, with Brooks concocting a series of songs inspired by the dueling qualities of stasis and change that cycle through the changing of the seasons. It's even got some wonderfully apt sleeve notes by Ronald Hutton, the head of History at Bristol University, who points out the various merits of seasonal festivals in Britain. Like most Ghost Box releases, the attention to detail is impressive, with designer Julian House completing the package via a series of images of an imagined TV title sequence, aimed at dredging up damaged memories of barely remembered children's dramas from yesteryear. On listening to As the Crow Flies it's easy to picture Brooks fully taking to his task. You can almost see him clad in a thick wool sweater, watching the droplets of snow amassing on his window frame as he prods at an old synthesizer during the wintery ""Now Ends the Beginning"". On the sci-fi fantasy ""Learning Owl Reappears"" it feels like he's been gazing up to a star-filled sky through a telescope on a long autumnal evening to find inspiration. This is a less foreboding record than prior Advisory Circle outings, but it's no less sad. ""The Patchwork Explains"" might be one of Brooks' most impressive pieces yet, with its icy synth tendrils spiking away at a plodding Kraftwerkian throb, somehow managing to be both playful and quietly beautiful. That it's dedicated to the memory of Broadcast singer Trish Keenan couldn't be more appropriate, reflecting her group's sense of wonder and love of offbeat pop. Brooks carefully varies the character of the album as it progresses, nudging the listener down a subtly shifting stylistic gradient that takes in a Renaissance era lament (""Ceridwen""), steely Europop with prog intonations (""Modern Through Movement""), and a lone vocal venture reminiscent in mood of Air's underrated 10,000 Hz Legend (""Lonely Signalman""). It's evocative, touching, and nostalgic, with the simple keyboard melodies often making it feel like this is all being experienced by a child blinking in bewilderment and amazement as the concept of the natural world is explained to them. But mostly there's a strong sense of discovery, of someone attempting to make sense of their surroundings, with Brooks cast as a voyager trampling through vast stretches of the British countryside, crisp leaves crinkling underfoot as he expertly funnels everything he sees and feels into song.","On an album inspired by seasonal stasis and change, acoustic instrumentation pushes Advisory Circle's electronics into a darkly pastoral place.

You Were a Dick,Idaho,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06db1335d7bf169a0fb/1:1/w_160/adcf1634.jpg,2011-08-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15713-you-were-a-dick/,Idaho MusicTalitresAnd,"""I hope you don't take it personally,"" Jeff Martin sings at the beginning of You Were a Dick, ""that I disappear like that."" He turns out to be addressing a photo of an old acquaintance on a computer screen, but those words also serve to extend an olive branch to his fans. It's been six years since The Lone Gunman, a somewhat out-of-character record heavy on cinematic instrumentals. A whole decade has passed since Levitate, the last Idaho album to feature the kind of slowcore they helped to define alongside bands like Low and Red House Painters. Between Martin's journeyman status and his quiet recent years, you wouldn't be surprised to find him in an aimless experimental phase by now. But instead, this charming comeback sounds like the work of a guy who knows exactly what he's good at doing. Jeff Martin and John Berry were in high school when they formed Idaho in 1992, and they soon issued their Caroline Records debut, the dark and baleful Year After Year. Over the ensuing decades, Idaho began to release their own records, and the lineup shifted around the stable center of Martin, who now goes it alone. While the laidback cadence and emotively minimalist instrumentation of You Were a Dick are vintage Idaho, Martin's angst has mellowed into a pensive melancholy with a wry twist. His vocals radiate a welcoming warmth, with just enough coarseness not to float away. No longer straining against high notes, he sings right into the grain of his natural voice, which fits the gentle recriminations and consolations of his lyrics perfectly. The music comes over as tiny and detailed. Most songs are structured around supple webs of cleanly chiming and pedal-sculpted guitars, or simple piano phrases, lightly dressed in electronic keyboards. But Martin draws many different aspects out of these common elements, from the ramshackle elegance of ""Reminder"" to the soft pastoral glow of ""Structure"". On the title track, what sounds like an EBow misplaced on a fret sends a shimmering buzz coursing through one of the guitar parts, imbuing its clockwork regularity with something a little nervous and wild. Martin is known for using custom tenor guitars, and in this spare context, those four strings resound like a miniature orchestra. He really lets us hear how his fingers move, with impulsive shifts in phrasing and inflection. The unique, unreplicable emotional character of each note and the snowflake-like differences between similar chords shine out in high definition. These little loose threads keep the soothing vibe from getting monotonous, as do periodic wake-up calls like the quick-and-dirty instrumental ""Impaler"" and the booming pop-punk of ""The Space Between"". Thanks to the internal consistency of Martin's time-honed tone, the mystical Neil Young-ish folk of ""Someone to Relate To"" can sit comfortably next to a shaggy anthem like ""Up the Hill"". Again, he knows what he's good at. But even more importantly-- judging from this familiar yet fresh return to form-- he still believes in it, too.","The first Idaho album in six years finds the longstanding slowcore crew-- now the solo project of founder Jeff Martin-- in a wry, pensively melancholic place.

Trouble Books and Mark McGuire,Mark McGuireTrouble Books,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03613d197565213a418/1:1/w_160/6e90a309.jpg,2011-08-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15667-trouble-books-and-mark-mcguire/,Bark and HissWagon,"If you were in a band and looking for a hired-gun guitarist, Mark McGuire probably wouldn't be the first name to pop into your head. There's a distinct chance the Cleveland-based solo artist and member of tweaked-out futurist outfit Emeralds might take your record and run away with it. That's a chance Akron-based Trouble Books, the husband-and-wife duo of Keith Freund and Linda Lejsovka, prove willing to take on this collaborative LP, released on their own Bark and Hiss label. Luckily for both parties, Trouble Books and Mark McGuire demonstrates a healthy cooperative relationship. The two factions built most of these songs by improving upon one another's already half-formed ideas; figuring out where one party's contribution stops and the other starts soon becomes impossible. Trouble Books seem to work in negative space, letting their insect-like electronic chatterings, spare string pieces, and slow-burning, upward-sloping synths litter the calm. McGuire snakes through these structures in a number of attention-grabbing ways, filling the molds with recognizable, frenetic layerings one moment (""The Golden Waste"") and unleashing a scorching hair-metal wail (""Song for Reinier Lucassen's Sphinx"") the next. The good-natured piggybacking coheres into a unified and direct whole. In fact, while at times these tracks feel like extraterrestrial Neil Young ballads, the most gratifying thing about Trouble Books is how completely immersive it is, especially album centerpiece ""Local Forecast"". A play on ""Forecast"" and ""Extended Forecast"" from McGuire's 2009 record A Pocket Full of Rain, the track exemplifies how even the most crowded McGuire/Trouble Books composition is still an exercise in transfixing clarity. Both Freund and Lejsovka sing on nearly every cut here, and while their calm, flat vocals may prove a little too distracting for some, they help reinforce the album's lackadaisical, daydream-like feel. Their vague, oddly graceful observations can be simplistic, but they provide a nice contrast to the sheer lushness of the music. Trouble Books brings together people who have an unusual knack for finishing each other's thoughts, and the result is an uncompromisingly pretty record.","The Cleveland-based guitarist and Emeralds member joins up with the Akron-based husband-and-wife duo for a collaborative, self-released LP.

The Rip Tide,Beirut,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06f13d197565213a47f/1:1/w_160/c676e36a.jpg,2011-08-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15715-the-rip-tide/,Pompeii,"Zach Condon's been wonderfully stuck in the past since 2006, when he first arrived on the scene armed with a ukulele and dreams of old Europe-- in 2011, though, he and his art suddenly seem especially out of place. In the five years since Gulag Orkestar became a surprise success, the dialog surrounding indie culture has drastically shifted away from flesh-and-blood odysseys like Condon's and toward synth textures and vague electronic sighs. (Arguably, Condon and the current crop of emotionally distanced indie stars share nostalgia for experiences not necessarily known first-hand, but that's another conversation.) What's more, many of his peers are in drastically different places, both aesthetically and commercially, since Beirut's last full-length, 2007's excellent The Flying Club Cup. The National and Arcade Fire have successfully settled into the arena-rocking stage of their respective careers, while Owen Pallett and Sufjan Stevens have embraced idiosyncratic conceptual weirdness-- Stevens especially: Just last week, the pair of Brooklyn shows closing his extraordinary tour behind last year's glitchy, restorative LP The Age of Adz were a complete cosmic blowout, embracing an Etsy-gone-neon ethos and electronic expansiveness alike. Back in 2009, it seemed like Zach Condon was considering a similar synthetic transformation. The back half of Beirut's mini-LP released that year credited to his Realpeople alias, March of the Zapotec/Holland, suggested a move away from his baroque stylings and toward homespun electronic pop in the vein of the Magnetic Fields circa The House of Tomorrow. Apparently, the experiments were just that, as those sounds are nowhere to be found on Beirut's third proper full-length, The Rip Tide. Instead, the project has turned inward, ditching the frilly drama of The Flying Club Cup for more plaintive, understated arrangements. Condon told The New York Times earlier this year that the relatively stripped-down approach was a response to his feeling like ""a dilettante with instruments. For years I was picking up new instruments once a month, and for this I was trying to focus a little more, stick with piano, ukulele and trumpet."" You're still going to find a pump organ part or two on this record, but otherwise, The Rip Tide's reliance on the Basic Beirut Food Groups (piano, horns, strings) keep Condon true to his word. Leading up to The Rip Tide's release, Condon also hinted at the album's ""sunny"" disposition. I'm not sure if I'm hearing that. The Rip Tide was recorded in upstate New York two winters ago, and although there's a handful of upbeat cuts (notably, the infinite earworm and LP highlight ""Santa Fe""), a good part of the album sounds especially soft and melancholy, a possible result of the fact that the winter of 2010 was especially snowy and brutal for the greater New York area. If you prefer Condon's balladeer side, then, this isn't a bad thing at all, especially if you are drawn to his richest, most melodrama-dripping highlights (""The Penalty"", ""After the Curtain""). Arrangement-wise, The Rip Tide is slightly more complicated than those past glories, with a few moments (""Payne's Bay"", the swelling title track) that, at times, recall the wooden psychedelic weirdness of Grizzly Bear. Things never get too strange, though: This is still a Beirut album, so declarative horns and impassioned strumming are frequent visitors. There's a newfound sense of restraint and stateliness on display here, and it's impressive that within five years and at such a young age, Condon's developed so quickly as an arranger and songwriter. Watching him ease into adulthood (he was 19 when Gulag Orkestar dropped) means we've been able to track the maturation of that rich, golden voice he possesses; On The Rip Tide, it occasionally sounds huskier and, in the case of his slight trembles of ""Santa Fe"" and ""Goshen"", a little more unstable. These little cracks in the drywall actually make him seem more human; his voice has always seemed almost too sonorous and perfectly dusty to be real, and hearing him falter (if ever so slightly) is a positive reminder that, not too long ago, this was a kid who, as he told the NYT, ""just want[ed] to swig whiskey and drink beer and go onstage and have a ball."" Still, he's a commanding presence, as his powerful pipes swing to and fro on the robust album bookends ""A Candle's Fire"" and ""Port of Call"". Vocally, The Zach Condon Show is nowhere near cancellation, to a point where the usually distinctive contributing vocals of slow-burning singer/songwriter Sharon Van Etten (who pitches in on ""A Candle's Fire"" and ""Payne's Bay"") are smothered and unnoticeable. Despite Condon's clear development, The Rip Tide is a defiantly small effort-- the shortest LP in Beirut's catalog (nine songs, clocking in at just over 33 minutes), self-released on Condon's own label, Pompeii. As such, it's a record that's easier to slip by unnoticed than Beirut's two other LPs. (The lack of the previously present heavy affectation contributes to this as well.) However, our own Marc Hogan put it best in his recent Playlist item on ""East Harlem""-- you get as much out of Condon's creations as you put time into them, and familiarity eventually becomes its own reward. Near the end of the album's beautifully mournful, penultimate cut ""The Peacock"", Condon repeats this telling admission into the face of fading horns: ""He's the only one who knows the words."" His antiquated fantasies still very much belong to him, but it's still a joy to peer inside them-- even if the canvases they're displayed on have shrunk ever so slightly.","Beirut's defiantly small third studio album finds a restrained, stately Zach Condon displaying his antiquated fantasies on slightly shrunken canvases.

The Lateness of the Hour,Alex Clare,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b057ea9e61561daa65e4/1:1/w_160/3a127bad.jpg,2011-08-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15694-the-lateness-of-the-hour/,Island,"Listening to The Lateness of the Hour, I try to hear Alex Clare, but mostly end up seeing a hat. A fedora, to be specific. Always front and center in the mix, Clare's voice drips with the brassy confidence and implied stylistic reverence of post-Mark Ronson ladies' men like Bruno Mars, Wallpaper, and Mayer Hawthorne, artists who seem to exist solely to don fancy duds in men's magazines that congratulate them for doing absolutely nothing to upset the concept of how this stuff should sound and look-- soul music as a fashion accessory, mostly. The difference with Clare is that the young Brit is being produced by Diplo and Switch and it all feels icky in a way any album does when it comes off like a record exec's version of Listerine, something that invents both the problem and the solution. This year, the likes of James Blake, Jamie Woon, Katy B, and to a certain extent SBTRKT have all made strides in satisfying those who'd prefer the fluidity and innovation of dubstep and UK bass music be delivered by knowable singer-songwriters. It was basically the same issue that people had when trying to monetize electronica over a decade ago, and Lateness offers up the same one-step fix: Keep it goin' louder. But the idea that this is even a proper forum for discussing the purity of the form gets decimated in less than three-minutes with opener ""Up All Night"". Major Lazer too minimal and chaste for your blood? How do you feel about Arctic Monkeys guitar chug with dancehall beats and that almost-rap cadence from ""Wannabe""? In its quest for confluence with lyrics that play out like a longform Bacardi ad, it's a tidy summary in how the hedonism of pop radio can feel so predatory these days. (Or you'll end up with a justified worry that Major Lazer's collaboration with No Doubt will end up sounding like Transistor-era 311.) From there, Lateness never does much to prove Clare and his producers were on the same page (let alone reading from the same book). Clare's songs are perfectly innocuous and only occasionally irritating transmissions from the mindset of the modern pop&B male, oversinging underwritten come-ons to either the woman who got away (""Humming Bird""), the woman who won't get away if he's got anything to say about it (""Relax My Beloved""), or failing that, her fine-ass friend (""Treading Water""). The line, ""I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe/ At the end of all you're still my best friend,"" basically reveals the borders of his worldview. Another problem is that Diplo and Switch are producing like they don't need Clare's voice and he's singing like he doesn't want their production. The high-NRG drums and sandworm synth lines hardly sound like necessary or even complementary additions to ""Treading Water""-- an ""unplugged"" version is helpfully included on the Deluxe Edition if you doubt me. Likewise, the caricatured deep bass on ""Relax My Beloved"" and the gospel-via-T.D. Jakes gaudiness of ""Sanctuary"" are nice tricks that may make you wonder if Diplo and Switch will regret not saving them for someone who'd actually appreciate the details. As the second half drags on, Clare tries to muster some grit into terribly sappy love jams with self-explanatory titles like ""Love You"", ""I Won't Let You Down"", and ""Where Is the Heart?"" making you wonder if Lateness is essentially a Ray LaMontagne record with beats. Then comes the cover of ""When Doves Cry"". He's almost certainly aware of the talking points-- not just the supposed audacity of trying one's hand at such an acknowledged and shopworn classic, but in how it fits on a record with such an exaggerated low end when Prince famously removed bass entirely. Like most of Lateness, though, it's more eye-rolling than pernicious. (You could argue ""Tight Rope"" is a worse crime for revealing Clare has clearly never heard of Janelle Monáe, taking the central metaphor from her song of the same name wholesale and nothing else worthwhile.) Truth is, it's much easier getting mad at the marketing plan of Lateness of the Hour than the record itself: The total mismatch of artistic motivation makes everyone involved come off like innocent bystanders, not manipulators. Call it GQ funky, Purple Label Sound, How To Dress Well (For Real) or whatever... I mean, you play this thing on iTunes and Genius recommends a ""similar"" song called ""Rocket To Uranus"" by Vengaboyz and Perez Hilton. Well done, all involved.","Young UK crooner Alex Clare's The Lateness of the Hour, featuring production from Diplo and Switch, comes off like a Ray LaMontagne record with beats.

Parabolas,John Tejada,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b055c0084474cd0c1c1f/1:1/w_160/606fa237.jpg,2011-08-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15692-parabolas/,Kompakt,"It's surprising that John Tejada hasn't hooked up with Kompakt before. The twitchy grooves of Parabolas, the L.A. transplant's debut LP for the Cologne, Germany-based label, fit right into founder Wolfgang Voigt's minimal techno aesthetic. What binds Tejada's eclectic decade-plus of work is an approach where it seems like every instrumental tweak and glitch has been studiously labored over for great stretches of time. Parabolas feels that way, too. It's a collection of 12 tech-house instrumentals, pitched somewhere between the visceral punch of classic Detroit techno and the headphone-oriented approach of 1990s electronica like Black Dog Production's Bytes and Autechre's Incunabula. That's some daunting company to keep, but Tejada has the skills to transform his pilfering into something greater than the sum of its influences. Opener ""Farther and Fainter"" is a case in point. The opening bars initially sound like they're pushing into the kind of densely packed prettiness Aphex Twin was obsessing over on Selected Ambient Works 85–92. But then the deadened bass drum beat kicks in, joined by a series of bell-like samples, and the song stretches to a close via low-end synth noise wrapped around a fading hi-hat. Blanketed in a pensive quality that most bedroom techno shares, the track is a good indication of what to expect from much of Parabolas, which essentially acts like a form of comedown comfort food. Occasionally Tejada strays close to a full-on ambient sound (""The Dream"", ""The Honest Man""), but for the most part Parobalas is deliberately stunted at birth. Tracks like ""Subdivided"" juxtapose zesty synth rolls with stabs of murky bass and rarely deviate from that path. Occasionally the trance-like state Tejada favors can be a little monotonous, but he usually works in unexpected twists just before the music settles into a rut. For example, a few corkscrewing samples light up ""Timeless Space"", while ""The Living Night"" tempers its house-y piano stabs by heading somewhere far darker and then frittering into ambience. The doomy tone that briefly surfaces in ""The Living Night"" recurs across much of Parabolas' later tracks, neatly contrasting with the airy material that opened the album. On ""Unstable Condition"", Tejada even heads close to the kind of relentless downer vibe LFO toyed with on ""Tied Up"" albeit with all the dissonance scraped away to fit with this record's late-night mood. The convergence of light and dark helps make Parobalas work well as a self-contained piece, while the album's sense of focus elevates it above some of Tejada's typical lurches in style.","The L.A. transplant's Kompakt debut LP collects 12 tech-house instrumentals, which can act as a form of comedown comfort food.

King of Hearts,Lloyd,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02bb1335d7bf169a089/1:1/w_160/b56e52d1.jpg,2011-08-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15658-king-of-hearts/,InterscopeZone 4 Inc.,"No contemporary R&B singers approximate the elusive stomach-butterfly rush of infatuation as consistently as Lloyd. ""Lay It Down"", King of Hearts' peak moment and a lead single that predates the record by nearly a year, is an exemplar: Its innocent, almost naïve earnestness is married to a preternatural sense for R&B vocal acrobatics, giving dimension and believability to his devotion. A distinctive talent, Lloyd often let his vocals dance around the periphery of a song, giving his best tracks a spacey, removed quality. As a whole, the LP takes a major step toward streamlining his sound, pushing Lloyd's voice to the center and making a bid for a higher level of recognition in the R&B world. Despite a few missteps, it is a major success, in large part due to the chemistry of Lloyd with producer Polow Da Don. Lloyd's knack for endearing romanticism is a vehicle for great music, and when the record falters, it feels like a misunderstanding of how his talent operates. The superfluous intro track can be forgiven thanks to its brevity and a surprisingly clunker-free verse from the Game. But ""Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)"", the first full song on the album, is bizarre and clumsy. The generic, faux-Motown beat frames the track as a joke, along the lines of Cee Lo's ""Fuck You"". Perhaps the right performance could have saved lyrics that fetishize the vagina as a relationship's vestigial remnant, but it's hard to buy the tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation of a line like ""I'm about to kill this bitch!"" from an artist typically so wrapped up in enthusiastic sincerity. Aside from this misstep and a platitudinous track aptly titled ""World Cry"", King of Hearts seems perfectly matched to fit Lloyd's strengths. Polow clearly understands those strengths. Outside the occasional producer's flourish-- like the grinding bass break that opens Young Jeezy's verse on ""Be the One""-- his work is primarily devoted to underlining Lloyd's vocals for maximum impact. On ""Naked"", Lloyd's performance has a dreamy distance from the physical reality of sexuality; instead, his vocals are draped in softly descending washes of guitar and muted trumpet lines, giving a sensuous texture to this awestruck ode to beauty. Single ""Cupid""'s exuberant chorus baits cynical listeners: It works so well as a radio single because, through mild repetition, the hook's infectious idealism overwhelms any resistance. The heart of the record, though, are tracks like the euphoric headrush ""Jigsaw"", where Lloyd's sense of rhythm lets his vocals dance confidently in the subdivisions of the groove, balancing sugary enthusiasm with deft physicality. Many of the album's best songs seem to inspire comparisons with dancing: There is a connection to the idea of dance as liberation here, as Lloyd's blushing sincerity builds up potential energy, the nimble performance acts as a release valve. In an echo of Aaliyah's ""Loose Rap"", album highlight ""Shake It 4 Daddy"" finds Lloyd dancing atop a vocal shadow; somehow, in his hands, even strip club storytelling comes across as boyish flirtation. Although the lyrics imply he's in the audience, the song's excitement suggests Lloyd is the one performing.","On his Polow Da Don-produced King of Hearts, the endearlngly romantic vocalist makes a bid for a higher level of R&B-world recognition.

"Plays ""High Gospel""",Efrim Manuel Menuck,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b063c0084474cd0c1c37/1:1/w_160/3b0622c6.jpg,2011-08-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15703-plays-high-gospel/,Constellation,"There were a lot of peculiar things about the recent Godspeed You! Black Emperor reunion: the unexpected, out-of-nowhere timing of it; the uncannily ageless, I-can't-believe-it's-not-2000 quality of the band's performances; the inclusion of ""Weird"" Al Yankovic on their curated All Tomorrow's Parties bill. But perhaps the strangest thing was seeing Efrim Menuck recede back into the role of silent, anonymous, ensemble player. More than any other member associated with the Montreal orchestro-rock collective, Menuck has spent much of the past decade deconstructing the mythology and challenging the assumptions surrounding Godspeed (take your pick: they're anarchists; anti-social; humorless; Luddites; squat-dwellers; etc.). Not only has Menuck's offshoot band Thee Silver Mt. Zion emerged over the past decade as a lyrically direct, increasingly aggressive rock band, Menuck has both made himself more readily available to the press and, in concert, become a rather hilarious stage banterist. So perhaps it's no mere coincidence that Menuck's re-immersion into the Godspeed regimen coincides with the appearance of his first solo album, Plays ""High Gospel"", a record that, in spirit if not sound, recalls another solo album released in the shadow of a monolith: John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Both albums are consumed by matters of love, loss, abandonment by maternal figures, and spirituality; both showcase the respective artists at their somberly tender and uncompromisingly abrasive extremes; and both are emotionally raw, deeply personal works greatly distinguished from the bands that earned their makers renown. (And, come to think of it, Menuck's wiry wail of a voice is pitched about halfway between Lennon's elocution and Yoko's anarchic shriek.) If Plastic Ono Band's psychic terrain was mapped out by the death of Lennon's mother and his blossoming romance with Yoko, on ""High Gospel"", the emotional goal posts are set by the birth of Menuck's son and the 2009 suicide of his friend/collaborator Vic Chesnutt. And as to be expected from a record recorded over two years in (according to Menuck) ""scraps and hiccups,"" the song-to-song shifts in mood can be disarmingly severe, moving from the churchly organ tones, defiantly celebratory choral vocal, and synth starbursts of opener ""Our Lady of Parc Extension and Her Munificent Sorrows"" to the frosty, electronic chill of ""A 12 Pt. Program For Keep on Keepin' On"", which sounds like a séance conducted via shortwave radio, with a cacophonous, click-tracked surge of percussion intensifying the feel of impending doom. However, as ""High Gospel"" plays out, such jarring transitions seem to be less the result of random, grab-bag sequencing and more a manifestation of the album's central theme: that moments of joy and sorrow often come without warning and, in some cases, are triggered by one another. The beautifully desolate piano ballad ""Heavy Calls & Hospital Blues"" presents a peaceful portrait of a sleeping child that's shattered by an ominous late-night call from the infirmary, while the mantric, ecstatic closer ""I Am No Longer a Motherless Child"" works the other way, as Menuck comes to terms with the pain of losing a parent by becoming one himself. But it's the seven-minute centerpiece ""Kaddish for Chesnutt"" that best exemplifies ""High Gospel""'s attempt to reconcile happiness and sadness, confusion and comfort, living and dying. Menuck has obliquely referenced his Jewish roots in the past, from the ""Mt. Zion"" in his band's name to the Hebrew script that graced the cover of Godspeed's Slow Riot for Zero Kanada EP. But here, his invocation of the Kaddish-- a prayer chanted during Jewish funeral services-- proves quite literal, as a mournful electric-guitar soundscape yields to a solemn, repeated group vocal (courtesy of Menuck and some Silver Mt. Zion mates), not unlike that of a temple congregation praying in unison. Though traditionally recited to commemorate those who have passed, the Kaddish makes no explicit mention of death, and likewise, ""Kaddish for Chesnutt"" makes no direct allusion to Vic Chesnutt. Rather, its repeated, increasingly impassioned invocation of the Old Testament's ""tree of life"" is Menuck's means of elevating the late singer to the realm of the eternal, lifting his skinny fists like antennas to heaven.","Godspeed You!

"Must Be Blind / The Mindeater / There Is No God 10""",Bonnie “Prince” BillyMatt SweeneyThe Phantom Family Halo,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04213d197565213a427/1:1/w_160/e3a5bf16.jpeg,2011-08-05 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15670-must-be-blind-the-mindeater-there-is-no-god-10/,Drag City,"Will Oldham has already released several singles and EPs this year with different collaborators and all in different styles. Like Bill Callahan-- another artist who came out of Drag City's mid-1990s bumper crop-- Oldham makes music that implies intimacy while evoking so many personalities that an overview of his work is more like a cubist painting than a candid photograph. He's worked at this pace for nearly 20 years now, and what's amazing isn't that he's managed to maintain consistency, but that he's made inconsistency part of his artistic identity. In the past two years, he's worked with David Byrne on film scores and remixed Hot Chip. He starred in a short film that made it to Sundance (Pioneer) and made a brief appearance in Jackass 3D alongside a gorilla. Even when his records arguably don't turn out well-- like the Tortoise-assisted covers album The Bold and the Brave or Greatest Palace Music, where he gave high-gloss treatments to his earliest, most rustic material-- the point is that Oldham threw out his ego and recorded them anyway. But an artist's generosity can be a fan's chore, and a lot of Oldham's releases end up being markers of time more than anything else. Of his recent offerings, ""There Is No God"" b/w ""God Is Love"", released as a benefit for two Gulf-oriented charities, Save Our Gulf and the Turtle Hospital, is most in line with what Oldham has done well in the past few years: Joyful, barefoot Americana at some unfixed intersection between folk and rock. Oldham's last two solo full-lengths (2009's Beware and 2008's Lie Down in the Light) are clever and diverse, working with sounds so familiar that the music's idiosyncrasies-- a bizarre key change, a clarinet or flute solo, a few extra bars of a verse where a more traditional song would've moved to the chorus-- melt into the overall impression of the music. It's an approach that Oldham has probably absorbed from country, a genre with enough clearly delineated rules that the fun part becomes how to bend or break them without becoming something unrecognizable: The innovation is in the craft, not the concept. ""Must Be Blind"" and ""Live in Muscle"" are two songs Oldham wrote with Matt Sweeney, the former Chavez singer he last collaborated with on 2005's Superwolf album. Musically, they're more stoic and musky than ""There Is No God""-- an influence of Sweeney's that brings out the fist-on-chest Appalachian Oldham explored on 1999's I See a Darkness, still probably his best-known album. There are Will Oldhams for every occasion; this is the Oldham to bring out when riding alone in the frozen fields before dawn or burying your first-born in the rocky plot behind the outhouse. Personally, I prefer the shroom-eating, big-grinned porchsitter he's become in the past few years, but his sobriety is tense and convincing, and probably the mood people associate him with the most. The Mindeater is the most atypical thing he's released this year in part because he gave up musical control to the Phantom Famliy Halo, a psych band formerly based in Louisville, Kentucky, where Oldham is from and has lived for most of his life. Three of the four songs are woozy and minimally arranged; one-- a cover of the Everly Brothers' ""I Wonder If I Care as Much"" featuring Slint's Todd Brashear-- becomes a an archetypal hard-rock jam dominated by Dominic Cipolla's electric guitar about two minutes into it. The recording of Oldham's voice sounds thin and grainy by design, which is a shame because of how full and expressive it's become over the past five or so years. In general, it's not a bad release, just one that doesn't play to his strengths-- or, at least not strengths he's developed so far. Still, when I started following Oldham's music after buying Palace's Lost Blues and Other Songs around 1997, I wouldn't have expected him to become as polished and celebratory as he is now-- some evidence that if there are roles he doesn't convincingly fill, it might just be a matter of time and a few more loose collaborations before he figures them out.","Three recent Will Oldham releases highlight how he has managed to make inconsistency part of his artistic identity.

And if you want to hear some utterly godawful rapping, pull up a video of Chiddy finishing off that marathon. Or rapping for a 10-minute stretch during hour five. Or 22 minutes into it. Really, any random moment from the writ-large publicity stunt is going to give you some truly clumsy time-killing fluffiness. Even if Chiddy was Rakim, he couldn't have pulled this thing off; there's not a rapper alive who could say anything compelling for nine hours straight. But a great rapper wouldn't have attempted this stunt because a great rapper wouldn't have needed to do it. There's no worthwhile artistic reason to rap for that long-- it's pure online traffic-bait. When you rap for nine hours, words stop meaning anything; they become a way to fill time. If you pull up a random video from the nine-hour stretch, you'll see Chiddy wandering aimlessly around a spotlessly furnished room, flopping down on a blinding white couch, lifelessly throwing out words while the other dudes in the room stare at their iPhones. It's depressing. That same disregard for language is all over Peanut Butter and Swelly, Chiddy Bang's recent mixtape. As a rapper, Chiddy never shows the slightest bit of intensity or emotion. This is breezy cool-kid rap and nothing more, which might be fine if Chiddy did it with style. Instead, we get some truly awkward, forced, jumbled line construction. On the very first song, Chiddy actually uses the word ""hashtag"" in a (terrible) hashtag-rap punchline. Here's Chiddy on himself: ""My life is pretty as the face of a girl/ And watch out, I got too much soul for the world."" On a girl: ""She got them soft legs/ She got them plum thighs/ And her bathing suit is something that is fun-sized."" On his rivals: ""Rapper, you should die/ Reading Catcher in the Rye."" It's grisly. Chiddy Bang first started building blog attention because producer Xaphoon Jones used samples of some extremely recognizable mainstream-indie pop hits (MGMT's ""Kids"", Sufjan Stevens' ""Chicago"") to build his synth-rap tracks. These kinda-juxtapositions don't quite qualify as a neat trick; rappers have been rapping over weird shit since rap's earliest days. As canny as they are, the production choices are simply lazy, a transparent bid for Chiddy Bang to become the one rap group a certain subset of indie kids cares about. So on Peanut Butter and Swelly we get stuff like Chiddy rapping over Matt and Kim's ""Cameras"", a decent song that's way too thin and burnished to serve as the skeleton for a rap song. Or we get ""Heatwave"", the posse cut where Xaphoon throws bleepy keyboard sounds all over a Martha and the Vandellas song for absolutely no reason. They seem to be aiming for the ""Oh, hey, I know that song"" reaction. It's not like they go anywhere with the songs. It's all reference with nothing behind it, and that also goes for the rapping. A line from all over: ""Got me throwing my arms around Paris, shit: Morrissey."" It just figures that this kid's Morrissey reference of choice would be some shit from Years of Refusal. On ""Heatwave"", after painful verses from Chiddy and the odious Pittsburgh frat-rap goon Mac Miller, we get a verse from the Texas gangsta legend Trae, who stays on autopilot and steals the entire mixtape anyway. (Rest assured that the score at the top of this page would be a couple of decimal points lower without him.) Trae has been making a transparent bid for career-revival lately, showing up on tracks with ascendant weed-rap goofballs like Wiz Khalifa. Even so, his appearance here feels jarring. Trae made his name with a gutturally depressive hardhead style. He's a ferociously powerful voice who can sound tough even when he's talking about intense emotional pain. That makes him basically the polar opposite of Chiddy, a rapper who never has anything to say and who always sounds comfortable saying it.","Philly rap duo Chiddy Bang's mixtape pairs a disregard for language with indie-baiting production.

Body EP,Autre Ne Veut,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05eb1335d7bf169a0e2/1:1/w_160/b6efba42.jpg,2011-08-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15701-body-ep/,Hippos in Tanks,"Before starting to read this review of Autre Ne Veut's Body EP, I assume you took a few seconds to investigate the above cover image. It is what you think it is. Not only is it attention-grabbing, it's a good metaphor for the music of this yet-unidentified New York-based artist. You probably wouldn't refer to the extreme close-up of a female sex organ as pornography-- the clinical, uncontextualized presentation is absent any eroticism. Pornography's aim is to provide pleasure, usually presenting the most attractive and desirable package possible. The same is also typically true of pop music, yet Auture Ne Veut is every bit as obstinate as *Body'*s cover about taking pleasure-producing elements and making them raw and discomfiting. In much the same way the photo delivers a view of sex so intimate and vivid it might leave you squeamish, Body's music forswears the niceties of pop and R&B, instead rubbing its squirmingly real feeling in the listener's face. Body picks up where Autre Ne Veut left off on his terrific 2010 self-titled debut, utilizing pop hooks and R&B declarations predominantly mined from the 1980s, but presenting them as garish and unhinged. The results fleetingly inspire nostalgia, only to warp those comforts into something unsettling and queasy. It's terrain also covered by the likes of How to Dress Well, the Knife, and Ariel Pink: Autre Ne Veut shares those artists' mix of a strongly expressive pop instinct and an arty deconstructionist bent. Starting with disorienting synths and unnerving background vocals, EP opener ""Sweetheart"" immediately announces its disruptive intentions. Autre Ne Veut's vocals bend and leer drunkenly, sometimes sounding sickeningly sweet or affected, sometimes painfully sincere, as he competes with layers of swirling keyboards and blasted-out beats. It's followed by the lone throwaway of the four cuts, ""Not the One"", a scant two minutes of guest vocalist She Wolf's single repeated lyric (""This is not the one that you've been promising me"") sliced and diced and plied with spooky synths. That eerie aesthetic carries over on ""Just Return"", but here Autre Ne Veut complements the horrorshow synths with a gripping tune, powerfully sliding between vocal tones, starting off softly fragile before emoting with real abandon on the refrain, fervently declaring wishes for empowerment and acceptance that only increase curiosity about the man behind this artistic mask. The EP closes with the similarly effusive ""Your Clothes"", though here the mood is far more playful, with Autre Ne Veut grunting and moaning like an exaggerated R&B loverman over the kind of noisily fun 80s-inspired gallop that Max Tundra is also so good at summoning. Body's over in fewer than 13 minutes, but you feel like you've been on a legitimate ride: Autre Ne Veut almost never lets up pushing messily human pop exclamations forcibly to the forefront.","On his Body EP, unidentified New York-based R&B imploder Autre Ne Veut pushes messily human pop exclamations to the forefront.

They Came From the Sky,Human Eye,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b062c0084474cd0c1c35/1:1/w_160/2a6080a6.jpg,2011-08-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15705-they-came-from-the-sky/,Sacred Bones,"As the tracklisting suggests, a number of the songs on They Came From the Sky address concerns near and dear to the hearts of ""Coast to Coast AM"" listeners: flying saucers, alien queens, ""peopleoids,"" etc. Whether Human Eye frontman Timmy Vulgar's a self-aware skeptic when it comes to unidentified flying objects or a Fox Mulder acolyte looking to find a few potential converts is up for debate. What's important is that he's able to bridge that gap when addressing his congregation. As far as modern-day garage rock acts go, Human Eye used to be one that had trouble standing out. They could work up a nice head of steam when they wanted, and their fondness for the stuff of Ed Wood features and other B-movie fare was always charming, but their previous two albums were inconsistent slogs through various levels of fidelity and songcraft. On They Came From the Sky, the band's focus on extraterrestrials has been matched by an equally exacting focus on their music. Granted, the ""alien"" thing happening on this album is nothing new for Vulgar. This sort of sci-fi schlock has been a trademark throughout most of his recorded work. In fact, one Sky track, ""Impregnate the Martian Queen, Pt. 2"", is a sequel/rewrite of a track from Vulgar's last album as Timmy's Organism, Rise of the Green Gorilla. Also, a few tracks deal with topics that are slightly more grounded, like the self-explanatory ""Brain Zip (Kickin' Back in the Electric Chair)"". What makes Sky stand out in Vulgar's discography is the melding of these semi-nostalgic concerns with a sound that hearkens back to those good old days in a refreshing manner. If the intent with Sky was to create an album that could be the sort of Nuggets-worthy vinyl treasure one would find at a garage sale behind a bunch of dog-eared copies of Famous Monsters of Filmland and a Space Ghost tin lunchbox, mission accomplished. As a vocalist, Vulgar combines Iggy Pop's laconic drawl with Roky Erickson's unrelenting fervor, giving the pulpy stories unfurled in tracks like ""Alien Creeps"" and ""The Movie Was Real"" a little extra juice. Sci-fi-friendly sounds pepper a good number of these tunes-- the album's opening salvo, ""Alien Creeps"", features what seems to be the sound of a malfunctioning radio transmitter, while ""Impregnate the Martian Queen"" offers a burbling noise that sounds an awful lot like the 13th Floor Elevators' ""electric jug."" As a guitarist, Vulgar's never too far from ripping off a mind-splitting fuzzed-out solo that, like the rest of his band, is heavy and stupid in all the right ways: His rave-up closing out the album's title track is especially ""out there."" Human Eye have always seemed like the type of band whose perfect day involves a secluded basement, a recreational substance, and a horror/sci-fi movie marathon featuring second-rate monster suits and pie tins dangling on very visible strings. With They Came From the Sky, Human Eye finally make that sort of get-together sound appealing.","Sci-fi-friendly Detroit garage rockers Human Eye's focus on extraterrestrials has finally been matched by an equally exacting focus on music.

Let It Beard,Boston Spaceships,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0569d034d5c69bf4867/1:1/w_160/79d5a2f9.jpg,2011-08-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15693-let-it-beard/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","From the beginning, Boston Spaceships have seemed the very sort of band that makes double LPs. Over four albums and a live set, longtime frontman Robert Pollard's most dependable post-GBV group has dealt in obnoxiously catchy, insistent, Meadowlands-ready power-pop caught somewhere between Cheap Trick's Heaven Tonight and the Who's Quadrophenia. Pollard, Decemberists drummer John Moen, and Spaceships sonic mastermind Chris Slusarenko may not play arenas-- in fact, the Spaceships haven't played much of anywhere in years-- but their best tunes have both the hooks and the heft to reach the back-bleachers. Seems like any good arena rock band, whether real or perceived, eventually gets around to the double-discer. 2008's Brown Submarine arrived in the wake of a mid-2000s turn toward overcooked, plodding, patchy numbers run through with too many opposing currents. Over their four fine LPs, the Spaceships have pushed the hooks right out front, done away with almost everything short of the mid-tempo, and culled many of the musical left-turns, leaving Pollard with four of the most immediately enjoyable, fat-free LPs of his career. Between Pollard's excitable vocals and streamlined hooks, Slusarenko's rich but unfussy arrangements, and Moen's rock-solid but far-from-flashy backbeat, the spotlight's always seemed fixed on the songs themselves. A double LP is different: With all that extra room, you can stretch out, goof off, or beef up, all of which Let It Beard does, sometimes quite well. These guys, 1970s rock junkies that they are, are scholars of the form, and it's to their credit that Let It Beard doesn't sound like two single-length Boston Spaceships LPs affixed at the gatefold. It operates instead like a double LP from that format's classic era, with roomier tunes, more expansive arrangements, ripping guitar solos, and (largely inconsequential) cameos from the likes of Wire's Colin Newman, the Dirtbombs' Mick Collins and Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis. The way they break down Let It Beard's four sides even seems to hold to the classic template: A is for the bombastic, ambitious ones, the rockers are on B, the weird ones on C, and D brings it all together. Alas, that most damning of double-album takedowns is also true of Let It Beard: At 26 songs and 75 minutes, it's entirely too long. A portent of things to come, bumpy opener ""Blind 20-20"" never finds its footing, shifting brusquely between unadorned piano-and-vocal and a thuddy riff. Titles aside, the empty snarl of ""Juggernaut vs. Monolith"" and the centerless ""Tourist U.F.O."" don't fare much better. These first few songs either fail to get to the point (or don't seem to have much point to get to...). ""Minefield Searcher"" sounds strikingly like a Robyn Hitchcock cover of a Cheap Trick song and it's the set's first truly spirited melody, but it's over before you'll notice. ""Make a Record for Lo-Life"" proves the set's first big winner, its bright, knotty melody bashed out with marksman's ease, but it's quickly followed by the dismal ""Let More Light in the House"", a dirgey, disinterested moaner just barely salvaged by its banjo-and-snare-augmented second half. It's hard to think of a more lackluster stretch on a Pollard record of any vintage. Could be they didn't want to stick all the good ones up front, but whatever the case, no one's going to accuse Let It Beard of being frontloaded. Things pick up with lively punker ""You Just Can't Tell"", leading Beard into its heftier second quarter. The album's highest high, the sorta-Stonesy soul-singer-assisted pub-rocker ""Chevy Marigold"", takes its time getting everything right, and the stretch that follows-- the peppy ""Earmarked for Collision"" and ""Toppings Take the Cake"" and the triumphal ""Tabby and Lucy""-- is Let It Beard's best, a lot of fun without a whole lot of fuss. Not coincidentally, it's this run that feels most like the Spaceships LPs that've come before it, their tempos swift, their hooks coming in quick and dirty. In a way, Let It Beard's overly sinewy opening stretch feels like the tension before the glorious release of this rocky run. But the other Spaceships records have never felt the need to tease the listener in quite this way: There's no waiting around for the good song when every song's pretty good. Then there's ""(I'll Make It) Strong for You"", a stirring, stripped-down curio that ushers in Beard's oddest section. This third side finds Pollard's eccentricties taking over in a way (Circus Devils aside) he hasn't allowed himself in some time. Take the schizoid ""A Hair in Every Square Inch of the House"", vacillating wildly between soft strums and fierce shouts; it's not brilliant, but it's peculiar in a far less leaden way than the row of misses that kicks off the collection. They're not all winners back there-- too bad Pollard wasted a title like ""The Ballad of Bad Whiskey"" on such a dreary tune-- but they're the first indication that a double LP was, in fact, a good idea for the Spaceships. With all this extra time, they can afford to be a little odder, stick their necks out a little more, and while it's a shame they seem to separate the pop from the weirdness-- rather than letting them bleed all over each other, as on Pollard's best records-- at least here the latter makes a good showing. ""Let it beard and get all weird,"" Pollard sings on the title track, and that's as close to a thesis statement as the album offers: This is what we do, he's saying, only scragglier. And so it is. To cap things off, a side of solidly unspectacular riff-rockers and spindly balladry culminates in rousing closer ""Inspiration Points"". While it does bring together the diffuse strong structures, the stop/start energy, and a bit of the off-kilter weirdness that characterizes the preceding sides, it's not quite the misstep-salvaging send-off a piece of this length merits. Through decades of setlists and LPs alike, Pollard's always shown a knack for pacing, so it's odd that Let It Beard seems so sluggishly arranged. But Let It Beard's undoing isn't its formatting, but its songs themselves; there are simply fewer winners to be had here than on any Spaceships LP that came before it, and they're spread over a far greater expanse. A terrific amount of thought seems to've gone into Let It Beard's structure, its scope, its knowing nods to an earlier era's excess. But one vital question seems to have eluded them: Do we actually have the tunes to pull this off? They didn't; not quite, anyway. In a surprising turn, an email went out to the Pollard faithful this week, announcing that the brash, boisterous Let It Beard would prove the Spaceships' swan song. That's the other thing about the great arena-rock bands; even in their excess, they leave us wanting more.","On album five, Guided By Voices frontman Robert Pollard's power-pop band Boston Spaceships take a stab at a classic double LP.

iTunes Session,The Decemberists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0545e6ef95969321f55/1:1/w_160/749764d1.jpg,2011-08-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15691-itunes-session/,Capitol,"Like him or loathe him, Colin Meloy has become one of the most distinctive songwriters of his era. Combining antiquated diction with lilting melodies drawn from UK folk rock and U.S. indie pop, his compositions are recognizable whether they're sung by Marianne Faithfull, Patti Smith, or anyone else. What stands out most from the Decemberists' near-decade together isn't the albums. Instead, it's the songs-- ""Billy Liar"", ""16 Military Wives"", ""O Valencia!"", ""On the Bus Mall""-- that are the best showcases for the Portland band's lyrical indulgences and clever arrangements. The pop song, especially the kind that hovers around the three- or four-minute mark, has been the ideal framework for Meloy's explorations of prog rock, sea shanties, wake music, fanfares, and showtunes. 2009's The Hazards of Love was an especially egregious misstep. A concept album with an overarching narrative involving otherworldly lovers and forest-bound shapeshifters, Hazards was grandiose and mock-epic, but it evoked a world much more circumscribed than can be found in almost any of Meloy's individual songs. Most recently, The King Is Dead's abrupt change in style played as a retreat: a means of making amends to the same fans Hazards risked alienating. Impressively, though, the album's renewed emphasis on standalone tunes made Americana jangle sound like not only a natural detour for the Decemberists, but an inevitable destination. A few months later, the eight-song iTunes Session puts curious punctuation on its predecessor, with nice flourishes of fiddle from former Nickel Creek member Sara Watkins, but a tracklist that pulls from throughout the band's discography while skipping the high points. The Decemberists fare better on iTunes Session when they play songs from the new album than when they travel back through their own and others' catalogs. ""Calamity Song"" may not be nearly as calamitous here as in its studio version, but the runaway ooh-ooh-oohs make for one of the EP's most unguardedly joyful moments. ""June Hymn"", meanwhile, is no ""January Hymn"", but the song's folksy ramble comes through more clearly in this slightly more stripped-down performance than it did on the LP. Still, King dud ""This Is Why We Fight"" is a dud again here-- further proof Meloy's examinations of military violence work only when he filters them through character and story (see also the genuinely affecting ""Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)"" vs. the pedantic ""16 Military Wives""). And the band tries to salvage ""The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)"" by reworking it as a languid country lament, but while fiddle and weepy pedal steel reinforce the tragedy of the lyrics, the melody feels soggy, the performance a bit aimless. ""Shiny"", from 2003 debut EP 5 Songs, likewise rambles, though it's worth revisiting that early effort's ""Oceanside"" and ""I Don't Mind"". The primary draw of iTunes Session is the pair of covers that act almost as its bookends. They're an uneven couple. The Decemberists effectively recast Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"" as a country tear-jerker, but Meloy just can't muster the gravity to sell the song. Though Cohen's lyrical style is as stilted and heady as Meloy's, the elder songwriter's near-comical solemnity is a bad fit, especially considering what Meloy could've done with a tune by wryer Cohen contemporaries like Loudon Wainwright III or Randy Newman. Luckily, a locomotive-paced, countrified rendition of Fruit Bats' ""When U Love Somebody"" better suits the Decemberists' strengths. But it only makes you wonder how something like ""The Engine Driver"" might sound translated to a genre famous for songs about trains. In that regard, the EP's lackluster tracklist leaves iTunes Session seeming clunky and unrepresentative-- like it's not a full set, but an excerpt from a larger show.","A few months after chart-topper The King Is Dead, the Oregon indie folk band's new eight-song EP includes covers of Leonard Cohen and Fruit Bats.

Volume One 1970-1979,Sorry Bamba,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02013d197565213a3ed/1:1/w_160/7c466df3.jpg,2011-08-03 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15646-volume-one-1970-1979/,Thrill Jockey,"In 1960, Mali won its independence from France. It was an exciting time in West Africa, as the colonial governments pulled out, and the first generation of post-independence African leaders translated a wave of African cultural pride into public policy. In Mali, as in its neighbors, then-President Modibo Keita pursued a rigorous program of nationalization and socialization, and he encouraged development of the arts. Musicians were told to modernize the country's traditional music. Much as in Guinea next door, a system of regional orchestras was established. But modernizing the traditional music of Mali wasn't exactly a simple task-- the country is a swirl of different cultures, ethnicities, languages, and traditions. In the city of Mopti, at the confluence of the Bani and Niger Rivers, a young bandleader, singer, and flutist named Sorry Bamba jumped on board the modernization train with gusto. His band eventually became the Regional Orchestra of Mopti (Mopti is an administrative region in central Mali as well as a city), and Bamba worked hard to encompass the diversity of his region in his music. Volume One, assembled by Thrill Jockey with involvement from Bamba himself, covers music from Bambara, Fula, and Dogon traditions, updated with electric guitars and organs during the 1970s. By the time this music was made, Keita was in a prison in Kidal, having been overthrown in 1968 by General Moussa Traoré, who ruled the country as a police state until 1991 but continued many cultural programs. One of Bamba's greatest cultural coups was to get the Dogon people to accept him and teach him their songs. A cliff-dwelling people who lived for centuries along the Bandiagara Escarpment, the Dogon had long kept their religious rituals and customs mysterious to outsiders. But they let Bamba in, giving him such songs as ""Sayouwé"", which honors ancestors, and in return he renamed the Regional Orchestra Kanaga Orchestra after the creator god of Dogon myth. ""Sayouwé"" is included here, and it has an unusual drum rhythm that the band turns into something like funk with guitar and a bit of spacey organ. That same tripped-out organ is the main texture on ""Porry"", a slow-burner that also features a great Afro-Cuban trumpet solo by Bamba himself. The momentum it has might be best described by comparing it to walking when you're tired; it becomes almost more like repeatedly catching yourself in mid-fall than locomotion. Overall, this compilation explores an intriguing discography that, more than many, really feels like a meeting of folk styles and modern instrumentations. Bamba makes little overt attempt to funk up or psychedelicize the music, and where those qualities are found, it's an organic outgrowth of the old music he was working with. There are lots of call-and-response vocals, snaking horn sections, guitars dripping with reverb, and hand percussion. I love African funk, rock, Afrobeat, and the like, but it's nice to hear a compilation that's so dedicated to music so wholly African (and in a couple of cases, Afro-Cuban) in its construction. If you've found your way into vintage African pop music and are looking to go a little deeper, this set is one good way to do it.","Assembled by Thrill Jockey and Bamba himself, this compilation spans some of Mali's diverse musical traditions, updated in the 1970s with guitars and organs.

The UK band's discography is a finely detailed and uncommonly honest document of lives lived through music, free of schmaltz and coated with lyrical nods to the records they admire most (""You can hide your love forever,"" goes Comet Gain's heartbreaking response to Orange Juice). ""Jack Nance Hair"", from 2009 compilation Broken Record Prayers, is a manifesto for people who love music to an almost religious degree: an outsider anthem reflecting scrappy, fallible humanity through a record's imperfections (""Young, free, and single/ Like the crack in the 45"") and the comforting indifference of time through the turntable's ceaseless spin. The group's sound, accordingly, is a shambolic collision between elements of dream pop, mod psychedelia, northern soul, and riot grrrl (guitarist Jon Slade cut his teeth in Huggy Bear). On The Howl of the Lonely Crowd, Comet Gain's first proper album since since 2005's City Fallen Leaves, singer/guitarist David Feck and his revolving-door lineup of musicians put a new twist on their incessant dialogue with their favorite artists: They recorded with one. Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins produced much of the album, which means Feck got to live out a fanboy fantasy. The new album also features collaborations with some of Comet Gain's contemporaries, such as Alasdair Maclean of the Clientele, as well as their heirs, including the Cribs' Ryan Jarman and Shrag's Helen King. Jarman and Brian O'Shaughnessy (whose credits go back to Primal Scream) lent additional production. For the most part, Lonely Crowd finds Comet Gain up to their old tricks: paeans to impressive record collections (""Thee Ecstatic Library""), odes to cult heroes (""Herbert Huncke Pt. 2""), and wistful balladering (""In a Lonely Place""). The record's first few tracks, in particular, can stand respectably beside the band's strongest material, with jangling standouts like ""The Weekend Dreams"" and ""Clang of the Concrete Swans"". Side B gets bogged down by a few too many inert slow songs, but singer Rachel Evans swoops in to save the side with the ""Ballad of Frankie Machine"", a quintessentially British tribute to the protagonist of This Sporting Life that effectively channels the 1963 film's haunting mood. Even if Lonely Crowd doesn't quite live up to the bar set by Broken Record Prayers-- which was, after all, a singles collection-- there's still something dependably refreshing about a new Comet Gain record. The band's diehard convictions and carefully wrought lyrics seem even more vital these days, when ""indie pop"" often signifies a marketable sound rather than a lifestyle commitment. Comet Gain cling to the vestiges of that lifestyle with a convert's zeal. ""Some of us don't want to be saved,"" Feck sings in one of the album's most memorable lines-- presumably because some of us already have been, as long as the turntable's spinning.","UK indie pop lifers team with Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins, the Cribs' Ryan Jarman, and others for their first new album since 2005.

Soft Metals,Soft Metals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0499d034d5c69bf4854/1:1/w_160/f8987cfb.jpg,2011-08-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15681-soft-metals/,Captured Tracks,"All pop music is love and theft, and Soft Metals are particularly upfront about both. The arty Portland electronic duo formed in early 2009, with singer Patricia Hall and keyboardist/programmer Ian Hicks becoming a romantic couple not much later. The two recently did a mean cover of Throbbing Gristle's 1979 ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", a techno-predicting cult classic that mixes robotic arpeggios and steamy vocals (recalling Donna Summer's rapturous ""I Feel Love"" from a couple of years earlier) with the industrial pioneers' own creepy foreboding. Soft Metals' self-titled album extends that combination of lovers' intimacy and retro-futuristic ominousness, which Hall and Hicks previously introduced on the 2010 EP The Cold World Melts. With Hall's detached, often-indecipherable vocals over Hicks' pulsating configurations of vintage synthesizers and drum machines, Soft Metals bears traces of virtually every bleakly gliding descendant of Kraftwerk's O.G. synth-pop grooves, from gothic early-1980s new wave to house, techno, and electroclash. But it's somewhat telling that this blurrily beguiling debut-- which reprises two tracks from the EP, plus eight new ones-- arrives on Brooklyn-based Captured Tracks, a label better known for the lo-fi noise-pop of Blank Dogs, Beach Fossils, or Wild Nothing. As with their labelmates, Soft Metals' aesthetic is born not of lavish studios but in the bedroom. The songs on Soft Metals have a foggy, surrealistic shimmer rather than the clear-cut precision of many of their electronic forebears. Where Ariel Pink cohort John Maus uses like-mindedly retro trappings as a jumping-off point for experiments with ideas about art and artifice, Soft Metals concentrate instead on the type of subtly evolving textures you might be more inclined to play when you're drifting off to sleep than when you're throwing a dance party. Even the most lucid songs here, whether echo-besotted EP cut ""Voices"" or swelling first-meeting reminiscence ""Do You Remember"", stake their appeal on their glistening, ever-changing surfaces, not traditional songcraft. Still, just because your brand of old-school electronics has more in common with mood-oriented Italians Do It Better producer Johnny Jewel (Glass Candy, Chromatics) than with song-driven nu-disco princess Sally Shapiro (""I'll Be By Your Side"") doesn't mean the wordless repetitions of ""Celestial Call"" or ""Hold My Breath"" fully reward our attention. Then again... Soft Metals might wince at this comparison, but it's not such a leap from their album's prelude-to-a-kiss cover art to the Cosmo-copped sex scene (speaking of love and theft!) that adorns Washed Out's latest. Soft Metals' ""Eyes Closed"" may have a faster tempo, a more dangerous charge, and one fewer title syllable than languid Within and Without opener ""Eyes Be Closed"", but they're both headed toward a similarly sensual place. If Soft Metals are nostalgic, however, it's less for lost innocence than for a lost idea of the future. Where are the flying cars? The album's use of analogue synths isn't a regression, but an attempt to find a new way forward. On instrumental finale ""In Throes"", they finally do, as eerie buzzes and disjointed rhythms chart a course somewhere near the Knife's still-unmatched 2006 dark-electronic landmark Silent Shout. In the end, the more important love on Soft Metals isn't necessarily between Hall and Hicks; it's between them and three-plus decades of synthesizer music.

Last Words: The Final Recordings,Screaming Trees,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0489d034d5c69bf4852/1:1/w_160/f78aea0f.jpg,2011-08-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15680-last-words-the-final-recordings/,Sunyata,"Many of their Seattle peers ended up disgraced, drunk, or dead, so it's a testament to the strength of the record industry in the early 1990s that selling a couple hundred thousand albums cast Screaming Trees as grunge's hard luck story. Featured on the definitive Singles soundtrack, evergreen psych-rock jam ""Nearly Lost You"" smeared its wah-wah guitar solos and the alluring dusk of Mark Lanegan's vocals all over MTV. But the band couldn't capitalize: Sweet Oblivion had already been out for months, and its ensuing tour resulted in more turmoil than triumph. Four years later, Dust was a very strong follow-up whose staunch classic rock sound made it a critical hit and a commercial non-starter on alt-rock radio. Screaming Trees more or less confirmed that for all of its anti-image posturing, grunge was still about fashion: Having never been embraced as reluctant, PC-friendly sex symbols or drunken lumberjacks (rumors persist that label execs tried to force out at least one of the hulking Conner brothers), the band called it quits in 2000 and went their separate ways in a manner that didn't leave much to the imagination until now*.* Last Words: The Final Recordings was put to tape during 1998 and 1999 at Stone Gossard's studio, features guitar work from Peter Buck and Josh Homme, and was recently mixed and mastered by Jack Endino, but it arrives without much fanfare: It's being released on drummer Barrett Martin's label with tentative plans for physical distribution and, unsurprisingly, Screaming Trees have no plans to reunite. Musically, it's streamlined and aerodynamic, the sort of thing you might expect as a ""back to basics"" move from a band getting together for the first time in over a decade, not one making the follow-up to Dust. But was that direction even really necessary back then? Though they waited until their sixth album to incorporate ambitious signifiers like sitar, tabla, and Mellotron, Dust was hardly the sound of a band gone off the deep end. More pointedly, the parameters for ""basics"" set forth here never existed for Screaming Trees-- this is neither the crusty SST punk of their earliest days nor the shaggy radio rock of Uncle Anaesthesia or Sweet Oblivion. Revisionist history has occasionally cast Screaming Trees as an unremarkable, workmanlike rock band blessed with a distinct vocalist, and if Last Words does anything for their legacy, it makes that notion somewhat true for the first time. Not much here bears the weight of creative struggle or even an idea dump, just up-the-middle guitar songs that could conceivably be the result of a five-minute writing session or a dogged determination to have something to show for a 12-hour day in the studio. Opener ""Ash Grey Sunday"" boasts the kind of casually anthemic guitar jangle in the lineage of the Yardbirds or ""About a Girl"", but it's garage rock in theory only, all simple transitions and lyrical archetype with no crackling urgency. A similar lack of development pervades ""Door Into Summer"" and ""Tomorrow Changes"", bright and agreeable strummers whose most interesting songwriting touch is a fourth chord on top of the requisite three. Any tie towards actual psychedelia in their rock has been severed as well: ""Crawlspace"" is the most audacious bit of studio experimentation, but it merely subjects Lanegan's vocals to the same tinny flange effect that's found its way onto too many Twilight Singers albums. Sure, I've got the benefit of hindsight here, but these really do sound like the work of a band struggling with inspiration, more unwilling than unable to push themselves: ""Revelator"" finds them kicking up some Dust with a bluesy front porch jam*,* but it's a total rewrite of ""Dying Days""; ""Low Life"" pops up later sounding like a minor variation of ""Revelator"", and the closing title track's basically a minor variation of ""Low Life"". I think we can all agree that ""Dying Days"" is a good song, but not that good. Ironically, Last Words is actually rendered more inessential by its best quality. In terms of sheer tone, Lanegan once again sounds fantastic. But you already knew that. Whether we're talking about his solo albums, collaborations with Isobel Campbell and Greg Dulli, or his more high-profile work with Queens of the Stone Age, there's no shortage of him functioning as rock's equivalent of Scarface (the rapper, not Al Pacino), relied on as a character actor specializing in a certain kind of brooding, wizened masculinity. An oft-overlooked problem with this lonesome stranger guise is that while Lanegan's lyrics read straightforward on paper, there's something weirdly unknowable about them. It's tempting to read into such a leading title for insight on Screaming Trees' mindstate during the sessions that caused their dissolution, but Last Words is sort of a record about nothing much at all. Even if the circumstances are different, I can't help but compare this to Rock ‘N' Roll Submarine, the comeback record released by a reincarnated Urge Overkill this year. Both were bands that similarly arose from a primordial, noisy 80s to the perpetual precipice of stardom thanks to a soundtrack hit, only to slowly burn out by the end of the century. And while each developed a distinct sound and subtly covered a lot of ground in their time, they're somewhat awkward to reevaluate in 2011, when few bands (if any) bear any sign of their influence. Screaming Trees lived a full artistic life and were often great beyond ""Nearly Lost You"", but Last Words is basically an epitaph for a band that died of natural causes.","This collection of previously unreleased late-90s Screaming Trees recordings offers an epitaph for a band that died of natural causes.

Science of the Sea,Jürgen Müller,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b059ea9e61561daa65e9/1:1/w_160/89321f0f.jpg,2011-08-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15696-science-of-the-sea/,Digitalis,"A skeptic might cast aspersions on the tale behind Jürgen Müller's Science of the Sea. The story begins at the University of Kiel in Germany, where the self-taught composer was studying oceanic science in the late 1970s. Müller purchased some electronic instruments and set them up on his houseboat in the town of Heikendorf, where he began crafting instrumental pieces that reflected his love of undersea life. His dream of selling those compositions to film and TV companies for use in documentaries never transpired. But Müller did press fewer than 100 vinyl copies of the recordings in the early 80s and titled them Science of the Sea, giving most of the albums away to friends and family. Fast forward three decades and a copy of the record ends up in the hands of Digitalis Recordings, just as a resurgence of interest in the type of new age recordings Müller was practicing is taking place. So it's reasonable to wonder if the backstory was constructed as part of a larger concept, the way people continue to wonder about Ursula Bogner or Endless House. One intrepid blog commenter even claims to have contacted the University of Kiel and found no trace of Müller's presence. Either way it doesn't really matter, because the music on Science of the Sea continues that superior strain of contemplative elegance records such as Emeralds' Does It Look Like I'm Here? and Oneohtrix Point Never's Rifts have touched on in recent times. Like those releases, the relation Science of the Sea has to actual new age music is tangential at best. There are no Gheorghe Zamfir-esque pan flute solos or anything that will drive you to join a local color therapy group. Instead it's an uncomplicated series of recordings, mostly based around gently unfolding synth arpeggios set to faintly pulsing rhythms. The tracks are short-- only five of the 12 here make it over the three-minute mark-- although Science of the Sea doesn't really make sense when broken down into its component parts. Instead each song works as a natural evolution of the theme set out in the opening ""Beyond the Tide"", where great washes of cleansing synth are interrupted by spiky twists of becalming noise that were presumably conceived to mimic dolphin chirps. It's not hard to see why this might have been thought of as a perfect soundtrack to a Jacques Cousteau-style undersea documentary. The following ""Sea Bed Meditation"" is full of rippling loops tied down by globs of tenderly resonating bass frequencies, not far removed from Klaus Schulze's contemplative solo ventures. Müller also shares Schulze's fondness for vaguely humorous song titles (""Dream Sequence For a Jellyfish"", ""The Elusive Seahorse""). What's remarkable about this album is how acutely it reflects and comments on the environment that served as its inspiration. ""Waterworld"" doesn't travel far beyond the coiling melody that ebbs and flows throughout the track, but it feels like the musical equivalent of a trail of oxygen bubbles arcing to the surface as a scuba diver peacefully plunges to the depths. Similarly, ""Marine Technology"" is all digital interference and signal jams, with zaps of synth noise pinging back and forth across the surface as though an urgent piece of undersea communication were being transmitted. Once you get deep into Science of the Sea, especially on headphones, it feels like Müller is simultaneously replicating that world and conveying his chimerical dreams about what it epitomizes. ""Coral Fantasy"" and ""Vast Worlds Beneath"" function as utopian fantasies about the great unknown, with Müller utilizing slowly disentangling sounds to give a sense of scale, wonder, and a natural curiosity about all the things that lay undiscovered down there. The way Science of the Sea subtly shifts in theme, from then-current meditations on the ocean to quixotic impressions about its unexplored expanses, is its masterstroke. It feels like you're on a journey alongside Müller, carefully mapping out the thoughts and fears the murky depths have come to represent, all laid out in a way that your brain would naturally process if you were immersed in that world. The closing ""Lonely Voyage"" even feels like a warning of sorts, with its foreboding timbre suggesting that you can plunge a little too deeply into yourself if you spend too much time down there. That's where this album disconnects from anything that could perfunctorily be tagged as ""new age."" This isn't simple relaxation music, although much of it could easily perform that function. Instead the beautifully uncomplicated surface structures are used to prize open a boundless amount of feelings that are every bit as complex and unfathomable as the ocean itself.","This record, initially issued in a small run in the early 80s, is richly evocative of the natural world and holds up as an immersive ambient experience.

Last Night on Earth,Elysian Fields,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b058b1335d7bf169a0d6/1:1/w_160/803080a4.jpg,2011-08-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15695-last-night-on-earth/,Ojet,"For 15 years, Brooklyn's Elysian Fields have been reliable purveyors of dream-pop and alt-rock noir. Singer Jennifer Charles exudes a forbidding cocktail-dress cool; her slick presentation conceals uneasy psychological themes. Think Mazzy Star on a serious Bad Seeds binge. The band has collaborated with many leading lights of the American pop avant-garde-- Marc Ribot, John Lurie, John Zorn, and Mike Patton-- while guitarist Oren Bloedow has backed up demanding traditionalists like Dr. John and Lizz Wright. But Elysian Fields remain a cult act in the States, a condition that Last Night on Earth seems unlikely to change. At heart, Elysian Fields are doing what they've always done: recruiting prestigious collaborators (the Antibalas horns, Jeff Buckley drummer Matt Johnson, and members of Bon Iver and Antony and the Johnsons) to back Charles' slinky chanteuse vocals. The group still gets the lead out sometimes: ""Red Riding Hood"" is a Grinderman-style seether complete with blues harmonica and a croaking Nick Cave impression, and ""Chance"" bounces on a glinting knife-edge of electric guitar. But more atmospheric styles have risen to prominence, like the foggy old-world folk of ""Johnny"" and the chamber-pop of ""Chandeliers"". Unfortunately, this mostly positive evolution comes with a problematic one in Charles' singing style, which is too blurry to work as a focal point. I know this is sacrilege: Charles defines this band, and she can certainly sing. But the exaggeratedly breathy and heavily ornamented style she cultivates here overshadows the diversity of the music with a uniform cloud of affectations. Compare these frilly flutters and meanderings with early songs like ""Star"" and ""Jack in the Box"", where Charles carved a svelte, forceful path through the band's chugging alt-era grooves, to hear how her cosmetic decorations sap the music's elemental vitality. She sounds fresh and inspired when she sings a bit straighter, as on ""Sleepover"", a breezy concoction of guitars, horns, and martial percussion; the title track also accrues a spacious, soulful momentum. Between these dynamic bookends, solid musical ideas are too often dissolved in expressive scribbles. Last Night on Earth should do well with those already invested in Elysian Fields-- and they are legion, especially in Europe-- but newcomers may need to start with 1996's Bleed Your Cedar to figure out what the big deal is supposed to be.","The Brooklyn dream-pop veterans recruit the Antibalas horns, Jeff Buckley drummer Matt Johnson, and members of Bon Iver and Antony and the Johnsons.

Field Songs,William Elliott Whitmore,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0539d034d5c69bf4863/1:1/w_160/2c8a432e.jpg,2011-08-02 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15690-field-songs/,Anti-,"William Elliott Whitmore is an old-fashioned sort: He's just 33, but his deep, gnarled vocals suggest a particularly well-trod life. A Lee County, Iowa native, Whitmore plays scrappy, acoustic folksongs on banjo (occasionally augmented by a bass drum), singing earnestly about things like hammers, steamboats, and dying. It's embarrassingly easy to picture him attacking logs with an old, rusted ax, or sitting by a campfire chewing on a stick of black licorice. There's a dignity to his work, which is unfussy and ambivalent to trends; sometimes that simplicity can feel admonishing. Whether he intends it to or not, something in his voice seems to say: ""Stop Tweeting. It's stupid."" Field Songs is Whitmore's seventh full length (not counting a collection of demos in 1999), and stylistically, it's right in step with his previous albums. Whitmore still works on his family's farm in southeastern Iowa, in a fertile little crescent between the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers; his official bio includes the line, ""I was out chopping wood and my uncle said I had a call from a record company."" (Authenticity alert!) He came up in the hardcore scene, sharing the stage with bands like Murder By Death and Converge, serenading crowds of agitated kids with tattoos and shaved heads, and proving that folk music could feel just as revolutionary, just as strong. On his last record, 2009's Animals in the Dark, he became a protest singer, skewering conservative policy and encouraging thoughtful mutiny. Work is a persistent theme on Field Songs. Samples of chirping critters pop up frequently (Whitmore and his family raise wild birds), and his lyrics tend to be focused on tactile, useful things: ""We're gonna do some work, spend a day digging in the dirt,"" he bellows on the record's title track, his voice suddenly big, bombastic. Plenty of these songs position labor as a kind of salvation, a way to insulate yourself from the modern world; for Whitmore, work itself is a threatened institution. ""Three square meals and a living wage, reminds me of the good old days/ Before the manifest destiny of the factory farms, before those cutthroats came and burned down the barns,"" he sings. It may sound like an awful lot of posturing, but Whitmore sells it; miraculously, nothing at all here reeks of bullshit. ""Here I am, working in the field/ If the heat don't getcha, then the sunburn will,"" he promises, with all the confidence of a man who knows such things. Although Whitmore is a talented banjoist, his voice is very much the focus. Weary and full of crags (from a lifetime of smoking, maybe, or hollering at hardcore shows), it's impressively wide and strong, imbuing his compositions with a kind of welcome toughness. Folk music has a reputation for limpness, but Whitmore's vocals are energizing-- they give these tracks backbone. And while a few pieces are undeniable standouts (""Everything Gets Gone"", ""Let's Do Something Impossible""), Field Songs really plays best as a single document: a soundtrack to a day in the field, a day anyone stuck behind a keyboard has probably yearned for once or twice.","William Elliott Whitmore, a banjo-toting folkie raised on hardcore, sings about hammers, steamboats, and dying in a deep, gnarled, energizing voice.

Afro Noise I,Cut Hands,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05cc0084474cd0c1c2b/1:1/w_160/c8bbe5e2.jpg,2011-08-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15699-afro-noise-i/,Very Friendly101 Distribution,"When artists with established styles shift into new sonic territory, they're often reluctant to talk about the change. After all, words can ruin the mystery of something as abstract as musical direction. William Bennett must not be worried. In interviews and on his various blogs, the founding member of UK noise group Whitehouse has openly discussed his fascination with Africa, how it influenced Whitehouse, and how it eventually led to his Cut Hands solo project. Bennett has even given his new style a name: ""afro noise."" Bennett's candor turns out to be wise, because the more you know about Cut Hands, the deeper and richer the music sounds. The artist's longtime interest in African culture and world sociopolitical issues (see his Extreme Music From Africa compilation, or the reading list on his website) adds layers of meaning to the songs*.* When you learn that Bennett has studied African voodoo, or that he uses native instruments like djembes and doun douns, all the rattling activity on Afro Noise I starts to sound like the rumblings of a global subconscious. Besides, there's still a lot of mystery here*,* particularly in how Bennett can make such spacious, often-catchy music retain the penetrating relentlessness of Whitehouse's all-out noise. Part of it is simple evolution: Three of the tracks here are from previously released Whitehouse albums, and they complement newer pieces that mix gunfire beats, heavy atmospheres, and piercing tones. But even the songs that skew furthest from Whitehouse-- like ""Impassion"", which could soundtrack a nature documentary-- have the dark, foreboding quality of Bennett's previous work. In keeping with Bennett's omnivorous tastes, Afro Noise I also shows impressive sonic variety. On ""Stabbers Conspiracy"", overlapping layers of pulse and clang reach Autechre-like levels, while the echo of ""Rain Washes Over Chaff"" and grind of ""Shut Up and Bleed"" dart between eerie calm and screeching panic. Ultimately, every sound that Bennett adds to his core of percussion reinforces the beats. But taken together, those sounds are a lot thicker and thornier than they appear on first listen. Still, this album is pretty accessible, and the question of whether Bennett fans would like this music were it done by someone without a noise pedigree will inevitably arise. But with Cut Hands, the point seems moot-- it's hard to imagine anyone else making Afro Noise I. Certain tracks can be compared favorably to other artists-- for me, the more filmic pieces call to mind the Residents' underrated soundtracks to the Discovery Channel series Hunters. But as a whole, Afro Noise I has a scope and vision that's pure Bennett, making this new direction less a wild leap than a supremely logical step.","The more you know about the new solo project from William Bennett, founding member of UK noise group Whitehouse, the deeper and richer the music sounds.

Legendary Weapons,Wu-Tang,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b051c0084474cd0c1c15/1:1/w_160/46b03f58.jpg,2011-08-02 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15687-legendary-weapons/,E1,"Note the lack of ""Clan"" on the cover of the latest Wu-Tang release. This 37-minute LP isn't a proper follow-up to 2007's 8 Diagrams. But neither is it one of those slapped-together collections of B-sides, remixes, and outtakes that mostly function as stress tests for the W's quality control. With the exception of Masta Killa and GZA, every top-ranking Clansman delivers entirely new verses here. Combined with low commercial prospects, that level of commitment means Legendary Weapons is probably the closest thing we've got so far to a legit, hard-as-fuck Wu-Tang Clan street album. Frighteningly, depressingly, or both, it turns out to be as boring as nearly everybody else's legit, hard-as-fuck street album. Judging from the tracklist, you might think Wu-Tang are trying to counteract the ""hip-hop hippie"" label Raekwon and Ghostface placed on 8 Diagrams. Guests such as AZ, Sean Price, Roc Marciano, and Action Bronson are peers and stylistic descendants alike. Marciano's Marcberg and Bronson's Dr. Lecter, in particular, prove that records restricting their worldview to grimy New York rap ca. 1994 can still sound exciting to this day. But those guys are about the only ones who treat an appearance on Legendary Weapons as a privilege, and for the most part, the Clan can't commit to underground hunger or regal triumph. Though RZA is listed as executive producer (make of that what you will), Legendary Weapons, produced by Noah Rubin, burdens itself with nth-gen knock-offs of early Wu producer Tru Master: distended bass, cheap horns, muffled EQ'ing, and drums that knock more like pillowfights than like ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"". But this is still Wu-Tang Clan we're talking about. They've overcome weak production before. I mean, Ghostface Killah shows up on, like, 40% of the tracks! How dull can this be? Legendary Weapons' greatest asset is nearly two decades of goodwill, but at what point are you just flat-out going to admit that Ghostface has been badly coasting downhill for at least five years? Here, Ghost is rapping like he's got someplace else he'd rather be. He leads off every track he's on with verses that weirdly seem to end a couple of bars early, to say nothing of the recycled rhymes about Clarks Wallabees, Mrs. Dash, and cheap rice we've been hearing for ages. Anyone who thinks Action Bronson is currently palming off a weak imitation of Ghostface needs to listen to ""Meteor Hammer"" right away-- it's the equivalent of Allen Iverson's killer crossover on Michael Jordan, Bronson going off in all directions in the record's lone display of joy in sheer wordplay. It quickly gets snuffed out by an atypical swag-rap verse that's as good as you can expect from a guy named Termanalogy. Almost by default, Legendary Weapons has its moments. Raekwon, who's clearly the most reliable of the crew at this point, pops off a typically adept quickie at the beginning of false party rocker ""Start the Show"", and everyone else at least competently plays to type: U-God the prodigal son, Cappadonna barely staying within the confines of spoken rant, and RZA doing his thing where his conspiracy theorizing flows like steel wool and has only the most tentative hold on erudition (""Islam is the way of life/ Islam is the way of Christ""?). With the higher-ups phoning it in, Wu affiliates Killa Sin and Trife Diesel must sense an opening, because the two go as hard as possible to assert themselves as first-tier. Trife, especially, sounds wholly committed to his aggressively average street soldiering, but whether he's spitting awkward rhymes about famous athletes or confessing the death of his parents, he continues to be proof that you can have all the self-confidence in the world and absolutely zero charisma. In addition to letting you know this is a Wu-Tang record, the beyond-tired kung fu and blaxploitation audio clips suggest there's supposed to be an astute anti-industry streak underlying Legendary Weapons. But these samples are almost entirely disconnected from the actual contents of the record. Aside from Method Man's streetwise reportage on ""Diesel Fluid"" and Inspectah Deck's skeptical ""Never Feel This Pain"" (actually recycled from 2010's Manifesto), little on the album acknowledges a world outside its own 16 bars. Truth is, Wu-Tang know time is money. While that much-lauded business acumen might explain the low-profile Legendary Weapons' utter lack of spark, it hardly justifies it.","With new verses from almost every top Clansman, Wu-Tang's latest isn't an odds-and-sods LP, but it isn't a proper follow-up to 2007's 8 Diagrams, either.

Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped,Moonface,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03cc0084474cd0c1bef/1:1/w_160/8b846b95.jpg,2011-08-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15674-organ-music-not-vibraphone-like-id-hoped/,Jagjaguwar,"Late last year, Wolf Parade announced that they were going on an ""indefinite hiatus."" What this actually means-- and whether or not it's a bit premature to talk of their ""lifespan""-- is unclear, but fortunately, Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug do not need each other to make good music. Last month Boeckner's electro-punk duo Handsome Furs released Sound Kapital, and it was undoubtedly the most impassioned record they've made yet. The prolific Krug, on the other hand, has been churning out interesting music for years with a variety of different projects, be it the eccentric supergroup Swan Lake or the increasingly ambitious one-time side project Sunset Rubdown. In a moment when many popular independent artists value accessibility, simplicity, and beach-ready blitheness above all else, Krug's continued appeal lies in the fact that he is an anachronism: a songwriter who's trying to squeeze Byzantine grandeur into the unlikely framework of indie rock. His catalogue is dense, charged with anxiety, and-- in a trick he may have picked up from Dan Bejar-- about as self-referential as a late-series episode of ""Arrested Development"". Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped, Krug's first post-Wolf Parade LP, feels like ritual music infused with 1980s nostalgia. Like his previous release as Moonface, a 20-minute marimba showcase appropriately subtitled Marimba and Shit-Drums, Organ Music springs from Krug's experiments with a particular instrument. Over *Organ Music'*s five tracks (the shortest of which clocks in at six-and-half minutes), he creates what you might call Nintendo spirituals: songs that evoke his double-manual organ's devotional vibes just as much as they do-- through the use of drum machine beats, loops, and some skittish programming-- that song that plays throughout all the underwater levels in the original Super Mario Bros. These tracks are meditative, hypnotic, and born of Krug's unmistakable infatuation with the organ's brooding drone. I saw him perform the record live, and whenever he stopped singing he looked completely lost in his own reverie. Which, ultimately, is precisely the problem with this record. Sunset Rubdown's last album, Dragonslayer, found Krug doing something that his critics didn't think he had in him: self-editing. It remains Krug's most impressive work to date because it's as accessible and immediate as it is thematically complex. Sure, there are dragons, muses, and forays into the Icarus Rhyming Dictionary, but there are also pummeling riffs and catchy hooks galore. Perhaps Dragonslayer's greatest and most unexpected triumph, though, was how emotionally relatable it was. It was a personal record about the toll that the worlds inside someone's head takes on his relationships. Organ Music, on the other hand, is more of an exercise in shadowboxing. Here, the music drones on without creating an inhabitable atmosphere, and most of its melodies are flat and uninviting. Even when Krug explores Organ Music's more interesting lyrical terrain, it often feels like an echo of something he's done better in the past. The opening verse of ""Whale Song (Instead of a Kiss)"", for example, feels like a retread of Wolf Parade's ""Grounds for Divorce"", but with less of a blunt impact. Which isn't to say it's all tedium. The opener ""Return to the Violence of the Ocean Floor"" is absorbing and showcases a wide array of the titular instrument's moods. And the standout track is ""Fast Peter"", a charming tale of recreational drug use and long-distance Internet love with a frenetic tempo and a weirdly compelling 8-bit Peer Gynt vibe. These two songs combined are about as long as Marimba and Shit-Drums; they might have made a good EP. Organ Music's press release has been floating around the Internet for some time now. It was written by Krug himself, and it is magnificently bizarre and fittingly meta. In it, he hints at knowing that this release is more than a little self-indulgent. He tells us the record was twice as long before he cut five tracks; ""You're welcome,"" he adds. He also seems to wink at the inevitability that we will compare it to the high-water marks of his career. ""Moonface will probably never sound like Wolf Parade or Sunset Rubdown,"" he says, and he's not wrong. Organ Music isn't reaching for any brass rings, so it's hard to fault it too hard for not being a highlight of his career when it never tries to be one. And Krug fans who can't get behind this particular side of him shouldn't get too bent out of shape; his back catalogue shows that something completely different could be around the next corner.","Spencer Krug's project away from Sunset Rubdown and the on-hiatus Wolf Parade continues to obsess over the properties of specific instruments.

Together/Apart,Grieves,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0359d034d5c69bf482f/1:1/w_160/cdb7e46b.jpg,2011-08-01 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15666-togetherapart/,Rhymesayers,"Grieves seems like a good dude, if a pretty intense and single-minded one. He reminds me of an aged-out, nomadic skate rat who posts up in a downtown coffeeshop to scribble poetry about the 10 lives it feels like he's lived so far. He's not a pseudo-intellectual, and while he's been through some shit, he's also not a whiner, preferring to be positive about his future, occasionally almost to a fault. He is far from content with his station in life, but he balances his complaints and worries with a reflective and forward-moving worldview, a methodology that Rhymesayers MCs (and the hardcore punks who preceded them) have mastered, ensuring that the smallish number of people who like them will really like them. As for bystanders like me? I wish him the best, but could I get some breathing room, please? Grieves asks us to serve as his casual confidants on Together/Apart. He dwells on the down-to-earth drudgery of being broke, kicking addictions, and getting over ex-girlfriends (On ""Heartbreak Hotel"" he describes one of them as ""the scalpel to open up my doubtful,"" which... wow); all of which makes for an interesting fit with the pop savvy and light colors of Budo's production work. Grieves is more than game to match his collaborator's slick, itchy Okayplayerisms, switching between rapping and singing as his partner stacks up the soul chords and funk flourishes. Over Budo's double-timed synth squirts for ""On the Rocks"", he switches to a laconic drawl reminiscent of Bay Area backpack OG duo Latyrx; on ""Boogie Man"", he more closely recalls the intense confessionalism of labelmate Slug on the spare verses, before the chorus expands into a more gelled-up rap-rock hybrid. The duo provides compelling surface-level reasons to hear them out, but in the end, it all adds up to well-produced, confidently delivered Rootsy boilerplate. After an hour of this, though, Budo's tracks start merging together into a session-level slurry, and you can listen to Grieves' laments only for so long until you start checking your watch, if not occasionally raising an eyebrow at an awkward turn of phrase. It's all encapsulated on the ""Juicy""-style coming-up narrative of featured track ""Lightspeed"", into which Grieves incorporates the positive admonitions of Blackalicious' ""Make You Feel That Way"" and Mos Def's ""Speed Law"". The pieces are there, as they are on much of Together/Apart, but the execution is lacking. Grieves' breathy self-serious vocal rubs the wrong way against Budo's lush, sepia-toned track, his shout-outs to Tamagotchi toys and Fleer trading cards (what, no ""Boy Meets World""?) are weirdly TMI and just sort of bland, and a clunky chorus (you don't need to follow ""once in a while"" with ""sometimes,"" because they mean the same thing) compel me to agree with Tony Soprano's opinion of ""remember when."" ""Landspeed"" is the sort of tale that works best when its narrator has much more distance between now and then; like the rest of Together/Apart, it's the work of a precocious artist who perhaps assumes we should care about the details of his life, instead of compelling us to listen.","The rapper's first album for Rhymesayers (and third overall) zeroes in on the drudgery of being broke, kicking addictions, and getting over ex-girlfriends.

Please Stop Loving Me,Nicholas Szczepanik,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b050c0084474cd0c1c13/1:1/w_160/05822061.jpg,2011-08-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15689-please-stop-loving-me/,Streamline,"When I first started listening to Nicholas Szczepanik's latest album, its title felt off by 180 degrees. Its single, 48-minute track is warm, reverent, and emotional. Compared to some recent trends in drone, which tend more toward the dark and cavernous, Please Stop Loving Me's bright organ tones are practically hymn-like. In other words, this is music that sounds like it wants you to love it. The further I got into the album, though, the more Szczepanik's wry choice of name made sense. Whenever you try to get too comfortable with his drones-- to glide across their surface or ride them like a soft cloud-- he pushes back. His sounds constantly twist, dive, and circle, avoiding complacency and requiring you to do the same. Innumerable shifts in volume, tone, and tempo occur with sneaky unpredictability. Often Szczepanik will lull you into calm waters before tossing you into choppy waves. There is a lot to love here, much of it mesmerizing, even soothing. Just don't turn your brain off, because Szczepanik is more interested in challenging than hypnotizing. The beauty of Please Stop Loving Me is that he manages to do both consistently. There's really no point along Szczepanik's journey-- which doesn't feel long or short, but more outside of time-- where the music's meditative qualities outstrip its thought-provoking ones or vice versa. In that sense, his material reminds me most of the careful work of Kyle Bobby Dunn. There's an intangible similarity between the ways both musicians turn sounds and patterns into wordless emotional language. But where Dunn is a master at massaging his tones toward quietude, Szczepanik excels at finding subtlety and nuance in immersive volumes. Even at his softest here, he could fill an airplane hangar with his music. Szczepanik's work conjures lots of images like that one. Whenever I listen, I find myself thinking in pictures and metaphors, giving shapes and colors to his sounds the way I imagine the faces and voices of characters in a book. So it's tempting to concoct a narrative that could accompany this sonic epic, and claim that its arcs and curves are scene changes and plot twists. Maybe they are, but what impresses most about Szczepanik's story is that it could be told only with sound, and only through his particular, engrossing way with it.","This album of bright, hymn-like drone is mesmerizing but also oddly challenging, with constantly shifting textures that invite steady attention.

Come Back to Us,Release the Sunbird,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00db1335d7bf169a056/1:1/w_160/42fd5848.jpg,2011-08-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15632-come-back-to-us/,Brushfire,"When a frontman decides to make a record outside of his main gig, the first order of business is to justify its existence. This is particularly true in the case of Zach Rogue's stepping out as Release the Sunbird: though Rogue Wave grew from a solo project to a full-time band in a matter of months, I imagine a guy who sorta named the band after himself maintains as much songwriting autonomy as he wants. But upon holing up in a Bloomington, Ind., studio with a batch of unfinished songs after a grueling tour stint, you could assume that Rogue wanted to pump the brakes on a band that was getting bigger and not necessarily better. Of all the records from the past decade accurately likened to the Shins, Out of the Shadow and Descended Like Vultures are pretty much the only two that still hold up. But attempts to muscle up for amphitheaters (Asleep at Heaven's Gate) and dancefloors (Permalight) proved Rogue Wave's charming indie pop wasn't really scalable. On the title track here, Rogue sings, ""I'm already able to cut myself down if I need to,"" and Come Back to Us goes out of its way to be accommodating to those unconvinced by the direction Rogue had been taking. Described as a ""solo project, yet not,"" it brings him back to the Out of the Shadow days where the bulk of the songs were just him and his guitar, occasional production touches applied after the fact. Opener ""It's All Around You"" is more of a purposeful mantra than song, the single titular lyric doubling seeping Farfisa (courtesy of the Wave's Pat Spurgeon) and surprisingly loud drums for an enveloping, you-are-there sound. Come Back to Us never rocks that hard again (""rocks"" being relative), but the homey warmth is maintained through an au naturel recording where every scrape of fingernails on guitar strings, bounce of room echo, and imperfect harmony is kept intact. Even the more surprising studio touches-- a distorted percussive effect on ""Come Back to Us"", guiro, the unsettling reverb of ""A New You""-- come off like natural found sound amidst rumpled folk-pop that doesn't sound composed so much as snuggled into wakefulness. Yet for all of its dewy production and dog-eared melodies, Rogue's words themselves sag with the burden of addiction, death, and fatherhood: It sounds like early morning music for people who've been up all night struggling with something heavy. Though it's not addressed to anyone specific, ""Always Like the Son"" carries devastating weight, the passing of a brother or one's closest friend being used as a reflection for one's own personal shortcomings. ""Why Can't You Look at Yourself"" instantly recalls an unplugged version of Descended Like Vulture's ""Bird on a Wire"", but forgoes its lighter-waving to seek relief from the powerlessness of watching an alcoholic waste away. If not so much a sharp turn for Rogue sonically (""California"" and ""Christians in Black"" come to my mind), it's unquestionably the most personal and direct he's ever been-- a lyric like ""all this emotion, can't help myself"" might read cloying, but it's the purest distillation of a record that thrives on straightforwardness and honesty. But while Come Back to Us isn't Rogue's longest release, it's got the longest tracklist and it's a little too good at establishing mood: The cumulative effect of 12 straight ballads of misty eyes and resigned acceptance after ""It's All Around You"" saps the individual effect of each. Or maybe the most powerful of the songs all come in the first half, and as Come Back to Us pushes toward its disappointingly vague closer, ""Outlook's Anonymous"", Rogue's words get more terse and emotionally illegible without offering any compensation in volume or melody. Still, it's a shame that the songs on Come Back to Us weren't available to Rogue previously, since ""A New You"" or ""Why Can't You Look at Yourself"" could've certainly counterbalanced some of his more awkwardly ambitious moments of late. So even if it's a pointedly despondent record, it actually makes me hopeful that Rogue hasn't wholly lost touch with the humble charm of his best work.","The Rogue Wave frontman makes a solo album and captures some of what made his main band's early records interesting.

Satin Panthers EP,Hudson Mohawke,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04d9d034d5c69bf485b/1:1/w_160/8a07e64a.jpg,2011-08-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15685-satin-panthers-ep/,Warp,"Hudson Mohawke's recent output-- a bonkers remix of Wiley's ""Electric Boogaloo"", a handful of decent edits on his Soundcloud-- has been enough to catch relatively high-profile ears. Not long ago, the Glasgow producer (real name: Ross Birchard) received a ridiculously glowing Twitter shout-out from hip-hop head-knocker Just Blaze, and Chris Brown jumped on an old HudMo track. Still, in a way it's surprising Mohawke has received any level of popularity beyond beat freaks and Warp roster-checkers. His 2009 debut LP, Butter, didn't exactly flow like the melted yellow stuff; it was an unfocused mix of future-R&B pastiche and jumbled funk experimentation. Good thing for second chances. Mohawke's new Satin Panthers EP shows the kind of improvement that a couple of years in the lab will do for you. His music is still jumbled-sounding, but rather than being sneakily complicated, this record is obviously so; the fact it all works so well is the sneaky part. Mohawke packs in oodles of genre- and artist-specific tics: the hard-hitting repetition of Chicago juke, the sharp melodic tang of Bristol's ""purple"" scene, the sticky swarm of Los Angeles-era Flying Lotus, the light-cycle chaos of hip-hop producer Lex Luger, and the galloping rhythms of UK funky. Which might sound like the recipe for a total mess, except HudMo combines every ingredient expertly. One complaint: The EP's 17-minute run time feels too brief. Luckily, Satin Panthers offers more than enough to tide listeners over until a potential follow-up album, whether the double-octave bass line on ""Thunder Bay"" or the building synth spirals on ""Octan"". The closing track, a burst of marching-band mania, is called ""Thank You"", but when all's said and done, there's a lot of gratitude to go around here.","Amid attention from mainstream hip-hop, the Glasgow producer's latest shows he has improved markedly since 2009 debut Butter.

Icky Mettle,Archers of Loaf,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b052c0084474cd0c1c19/1:1/w_160/4deb99c2.jpg,2011-08-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15688-icky-mettle/,MergeFire,"No single trend in 1990s indie rock can be traced back to Archers of Loaf. They weren't quite ""lo-fi,"" they weren't quite ""slackers,"" their guitars weren't quite ""noisy"" and their drums weren't quite ""mathy."" Eric Bachmann's vocals were gritty and visceral, but his lyrics were oblique and cerebral. Archers of Loaf thrived on subtle contradictions, on purposeful vagaries, on tentative gestures delivered with utmost conviction. It comes as neither a surprise nor a disappointment that this much-needed remaster of the band's 1993 debut, Icky Mettle, isn't particularly revelatory: Everything is still right there in the songs themselves. It seems fitting that Archers of Loaf's first reunion show this year was not a high-profile festival appearance, but rather an unannounced ""opening"" slot for now-labelmates the Love Language at a mid-sized rock club. Like fellow North Carolinians Superchunk, Archers passed on interest from a major label during the 90s ""alternative"" gold rush, signing instead with independent label Alias (then home to Yo La Tengo and the Loud Family). They released increasingly adventurous records for five years, and broke up with minimal drama or fanfare. This, the first in a series of planned deluxe reissues from Merge, perfectly captures the energy of the band's early days, from their slapdash first singles to the scrappy brilliance of Icky Mettle itself to the more honed recordings that followed. Released on the heels of some well-received singles and a buzzed-about performance at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, Icky Mettle was a hotly anticipated debut for the pre-Internet age. To say it starts on a strong note would be an understatement; opener ""Web in Front"" is quite simply among the finest indie rock songs ever written. That a song whose lyrics are all but impossible to parse literally comes off as so immediate and relatable speaks both to Bachmann's skill with words-as-sounds, and to his bandmates' ability to put force and nuance behind his voice. Much of the credit here belongs to guitarist Eric Johnson, whose melodic and fluttery guitar parts seem to hammer the very emotional notes that Bachmann's words intentionally skirt. ""Web in Front"" finds its near-equal in ""Wrong"", B-side to the band's first single and perhaps their most compelling study in self-effacing aggression. It is only in the second half of the song's ascendant chorus that Bachmann admits, ""I do not think that you could like me anyway/ Because you are superior in all aspects to me,"" echoing the first half of the chorus but inverting the previously uttered ""inferior."" This self-fulfilling fatalism is at the heart of innumerable rock songs by innumerable bitter young men, but it is rarely expressed with the introspective clarity that Bachmann displays throughout Icky Mettle. The second disc of Merge's reissue compiles the excellent Vs. the Greatest of All Time EP and the early singles that were previously included on the Speed of Cattle compilation. The five songs from Vs. the Greatest of All Time hint at the more spacious and muscular sound that the band would cultivate on their sophomore LP, Vee Vee, while early 7"" versions of ""Wrong"" and ""Web in Front"" are disjointed and flaccid previews of their album counterparts. The slightly claustrophobic sonics and consistent midtempo clip of Icky Mettle can be daunting at times, and the textural variety of this bonus material makes for a welcome change of pace. The ramshackle sound of Icky Mettle earned Archers of Loaf comparisons to Pavement (and the occasional dismissal as a Pavement ripoff act), but Bachmann's earnest self-consciousness is miles away from Stephen Malkmus's arch self-awareness. The strain in Bachmann's voice as he sings ""clearly, this is your loss"" in prescient hipster diss ""Plumb Line"" is devastating, a crack of self-doubt that masterfully undermines the pointed decisiveness of Bachmann's language. Uncertainty has never sounded so much like a rallying cry.","The Archers' searing 1993 debut still stands as a high-water mark in 90s indie rock, and is augmented on this deluxe reissue with a key EP and singles.

Famous First Words,Viva Brother,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b038ea9e61561daa65b5/1:1/w_160/8ea39a61.jpg,2011-07-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15669-famous-first-words/,Geffen,"Viva Brother are the latest UK hype band to emerge seemingly from nowhere, this time making self-proclaimed ""Grit Pop."" The term is an obvious nod to Britpop but also to their hometown of Slough (which, by the way, still isn't half as gritty as Pulp's early 1990s Sheffield). A large part of how they have made it this far has to do with their loudmouth posturing in the British indie press and in public starting their second ever gig with the line ""If anyone here doesn’t want to see the future of music, leave now."" That kind of sassy talk has polarized the UK press but at least puts them leagues ahead of countless other faceless major label bands in the personality game. However, all that bluster and boasting comes undone when listening to Famous First Words and you realise they actually don't have anything to say at all. The songs range from a parade of clichés to the plain ridiculous, none more so than ""I met the mermaid and I showed her just how to run,"" from ""False Alarm"", a song that also relays an imagined conversation with a tornado. Those kind of ideas come across as an unintentionally hilarious attempt to out-stupid Oasis at their most obtuse, but even the Gallaghers had enough sense to qualify their non-sequiturs with lines about getting high. Also, at least somebody in ""Champagne Supernova"" was having fun, because let's be clear-- nobody on this record is having fun, not you the listener nor any member of Viva Brother. Musically, things are just as drab and any hint of an interesting idea on Famous First Words can easily traced back to a much more appealing root. Take opening track ""New Year's Day"" for example and its wordless chorus, lifted almost directly from the coda of Blur's ""Girls and Boys"", but replacing that bands cheeky charm with try-hard conviction. And then there's ""Otherside"", which opens with a promising Chameleons-like guitar line before descending into yet more chugging guitar and infant grade lyrics. This time Newell recounts the places he has been leaving his head-- at the end of the phone, by a bedside light-- before sneering ""I got a job/ That I don't want"". It's pretty brainless stuff, the special kind that makes you feel somehow stupider for having listened. Look, It's easy to see why Viva Brother were given a shot at the big time-- the dual allure of a Britpop revival and four arrogant young men with guitars must have been impossible for record execs to resist. But in execution the whole thing comes off as nothing more than a thinly disguised, crass attempt to smoke latent Oasis fans out of hiding. Unfortunately for them, Beady Eye already beat them to the punch.","Hyped UK band tries to recapture the glory days of Britpop and fails rather miserably.

Bent,Ssion,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04ab1335d7bf169a0b7/1:1/w_160/cc492268.jpg,2011-07-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15682-bent/,self-released,"SSION is Kansas City, Missouri freak-scene collective led by charismatic mastermind Cody Critcheloe. He founded SSION while at art school there-- his extracurricular credits include album art for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and music videos for the likes of Liars-- and the band communicates over a wide range of media: campy, trashy music videos that would make John Waters smile; elaborate stage shows involving garish sets and costumes; and the kind of attitude-heavy electro pop that would go over equally well at the gay disco as the queercore dive bar. The question then is how does this stuff hold up outside the disco, without the dance routines or the videos, on its own, as an album? The answer on Bent is: unfortunately, only okay. The album's lead single, ""Psy-Chic"", is a delicious tease: just under three minutes of propulsive bass arpeggio, fluttering synths, and Critcheloe singing, in an airy and inviting voice, the kind of chorus that could loop on forever (""Sometimes I think about you everyday/ Some days I only think about…""). It even has a righteous Courtney Love appropriation (""I told you from the start…"") delivered in a deadpan speaking voice then breaking into laughter with a playful ""psych!"" If there's not already an extended 12"" dance mix of this track, it will be necessary to create one. If Bent's shortest song is also its best, then its runner-up is its longest, ""Nothing Happens at Nite"", which spaces Critcheloe's usually dense approach out over eight minutes, making for a kind of dubby, sun-rising house track that's more subtly moving than SSION's tightly wound pop numbers. More of this, please. Elsewhere, Critcheloe's songs and productions are pleasant and utilitarian-- if any of these came on at the right moment on the right dance floor, you'd wanna dance-- but ultimately insubstantial, fizzing out of one's memory almost as soon as they're finished playing. Still, there are some nice touches: the funhouse bells and whistles of ""Blonde With U"", the Freestyle-by-way-of-Hercules and Love Affair ""Luvvbazzar"", the muted beatboxing of ""Growin"", the drippy snaps occasionally overwhelmed by oppressive drum pulse on ""Feel Good (4-Evr)"", the brightly upbeat ""My Love Grows in the Dark"". But nothing on Bent pops off the screen quite as vibrantly as ""Psy-Chic"" or with as much cool confidence as ""Nothing Ever Happens at Nite"". Maybe it's unfair to judge Bent as a stand-alone object, as the point or the primary document of the SSION project rather than as merely one prong of many in a multimedia pincer attack. But taken on those terms, it leaves you longing for the discotheque. Maybe that's the point.","Latest album from the Kansas City, Missouri, multimedia art project playfully mixes disco and attitude-heavy electro pop.

Please, don't hold that against them. The band's genesis may be purely millennial, but its music is firmly situated in the 1990s. Grooms' 2009 debut, Rejoicer, slightly recalls the shambling rawness of early Modest Mouse; for the follow-up, Prom, Grooms dive headlong into the sweeping erotic confusion that permeated the dreamier sphere of 90s alt-rock. They aren't the only band making such a maneuver this year (see: Being Pure at Heart, the Pains of), but Grooms' aims give off a whiff of vague danger, a static unease occasionally broken by detuned guitars and skins-smashing breakdowns. Travis Johnson's swinging, strung-out pipes dominate here, though bassist Emily Ambruso somewhat ill-advisedly takes the mic on the short breakup blast ""Sharing"", which sounds quite a bit like fellow New York shoegaze fetishists Asobi Seksu. Like that band, Grooms have little relation to the Brooklyn scene's recent shift away from hazy, distanced rock toward synths and new age tropes. Although Prom does occasionally dip into the well of perpetually vogue, vague nostalgia (""17 is the whole world/ In my room/ The Smiths, and girls""), the album is especially close-focus when compared to a few of the band's regional peers. When Grooms hit the sticky, slack-jawed realities of album highlights ""Expression of"" and ""Skating With Girl"", they rank among the few guitar-indie bands so unafraid to match intimacy with clarity. Unlike another of those bands, Deerhunter, Grooms are still a ways away from managing to carve out an identity through tons of obsessive record-collection re-creation. That's especially true on ""Into the Arms"", where Johnson barks in a way that's almost distractingly like Les Savy Fav's Tim Harrington. The rest of the band doesn't have the muscle to match up with that sort of brawn (really, who does besides LSF?); despite Grooms' excellent ability to resemble many other bands without necessarily ripping them off, the track is a reminder that, well, not everything is a perfect fit.","For its follow-up to 2009 debut Rejoicer, the Brooklyn trio dives headlong into the sweeping erotic confusion of 1990s alt-rock's dreamier set.

MCDE's output is often described as deep house, and there's a long tradition of deep house producers simply borrowing polite brass and woodwind arrangements from old jazz records and slapping them on top of featureless beats. The results are usually bland, sometimes plain banal. An hour's worth of the stuff, all that polite chugging and all those waxy saxophones, tends to be good for napping but not much else. That's not what you get here. The mix opens with an eerily swaying Sun Ra tune, which is a pretty good indication that Danilo Plessow's taste in jazz runs more toward the odd and cosmic than the smooth and placid. But aside from the tart Afro-funk horns on the Tony Allen cut, there's really not much here that sounds like jazz of any sort. Even the Sun Ra record more closely resembles a kind of slightly sinister soul music from outer space. Across the mix, Plessow focuses on what makes the best deep house its own animal: fluid bass, swinging beats, and the spaciousness of good dub. And even then, as long as his choices fit those requirements, Plessow goes further out than you might expect. He often leaves the boundaries of deep house, or any kind of house, far behind. MCDE throws in old-school IDM and sweaty vintage Afrobeat, polyrhythmic weirdo disco and wombing ambient house, classic Detroit-style techno and the outer limits of the genre's Germanic counterpart. Like all the best DJs not bound to a scene, Plessow has managed to locate connecting points between records released years apart and for entirely different audiences, cuts that feature the muscle of live human drummers and rhythm tracks that sound more like computer hiccups. And yet all of them feel weirdly natural linked together, as if they were always meant to build to this whole, which begins with simmering dub and Afro-Cuban rhythms, moves through a mini-set of warm and ultra-traditional house, and then launches into various kinds of fractured funk experimentation from the 1980s into the 2000s. While staying doggedly mid-tempo, whether it's techno's pulse or disco's boogie, Plessow proves himself a master of pace. And while there are no floor-filling anthems here from any era, it's all too busy and bustling to be called minimal. Like all deep house fans, Plessow chooses tracks in part because they sound so luscious, with every piano and snare drum sounding extra crisp, perfect headphone music. But the bass here is so uniformly rich and powerful and forward-charging that even at its most gentle you never forget this is still music designed to move bodies. Plenty of DJs have wide-ranging record collections. Rare are the ones who can seamlessly mix between genres without sacrificing flow for eclecticism or excitement for a display of pure technical skill. MCDE's DJ-Kicks is one of those rare home-listening mixes that is stylistically all over the map but feels unified, that can mix records released three decades apart more because they feel right, because they produce sparks. If you're only a casual house and techno fan, this DJ-Kicks won't catch you up on dance music's cutting edge. But if you're looking for one of the best-mixed and most immersive sessions of the year, dance music that's both a head-trip in the dub tradition and unflaggingly funky, this is the mix for you.","Moving from Sun Ra to old-school IDM to Afrobeat to ambient house, MCDE's entry in the DJ-Kicks series is eclectic as hell but manages to feel unified.

BlackenedWhite [Reissue],MellowHype,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04fb1335d7bf169a0c4/1:1/w_160/f5d1eb56.jpg,2011-07-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15686-blackenedwhite-reissue/,Fat Possum,"When MellowHype first released BlackenedWhite on Halloween of last year, the world was a very different place for Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All. Events that would eventually cement the collective's budding stardom-- Tyler, the Creator's ""Yonkers"" becoming a viral sensation, their seminal performance on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"", Tyler inking a deal with XL-- were either weeks or months away. The group at large was still strictly a sensation in a small pocket of the Internet, somewhat mysterious, amorphous, confusing and-- as anyone who tried to grab an album from Odd Future's official blog only to be met with a broken download link could attest-- amateur. Released after that initial rush of online hype, BlackenedWhite (along with Domo Genesis' Rolling Papers) was, if not an introduction point, at least the first new music released since many had initially heard of Odd Future. Described on the crew's Tumblr as ""The Perfect Soundtrack For Mobbing On A Dark Halloween Night,"" and littered with references to dead cops, the album easily fit into the general perception of what Odd Future's music was about. So here we are, some eight-and-a-half months later, and BlackenedWhite has now been remastered, rearranged, and re-released by Fat Possum into a market where Tyler easily coexists next to pop stars. And yet, oddly enough, MellowHype's role is almost precisely the same, again representing the first new release by Odd Future since being embraced again by a wider audience. But where in October 2010 it might've been hard to pinpoint exactly where MellowHype stood in relation to guys like Tyler or Domo or Earl Sweatshirt, time has allowed the different personas within Odd Future to distinguish themselves. Hodgy Beats' wild-eyed glare can be seen next to Tyler on stage during Odd Future's shows, and it's easy to see how he could be thought of as Tyler's sidekick. And in fact, when people talk about Odd Future on a macro level, especially when that discussion is boiled down to the more controversial elements of the music, who they're really talking about is Tyler (and, to a lesser extent, Earl), oftentimes glossing over the individual members of the group. Part of that is by design, of course: Tyler has always been front and center, and not only is his star power blatantly obvious, but he feeds on being on a lightning rod. But lost in the shuffle is that the other arms of Odd Future are putting out music that is far from Tyler's trolling self-autopsies, which is both a good and bad thing. As a rapper, Hodgy seems mostly concerned with stringing together words on the basis of their sound in rapid-fire fashion. This is seen most obviously in ""Igotagun"" and ""64"", the two new tracks added to Blackenedwhite for the reissue. He doesn't have Tyler's focus or imagination, but his garden-variety shit talking, combined with gleefully inhabited fables of drug pushing and cop killing, bring the sort of levity that you would expect from a group of skate-punk ""Jackass"" descendents, and in a way that's much less obnoxious than, say, Tyler's ""Bitch Suck Dick"". What can't be found here are all the things that upset people about Odd Future, namely Tyler's reliance on slurs and his elaborate rape fantasies. And though Hodgy doesn't possess Earl's effortless rapping skill (who does?), his penchant for tongue-twisting alliteration further separates him from the stoned flows of fellow Odd Future stoners Domo and Mike G. The flipside of that is when Tyler storms through on ""Fuck the Police"" (now rebranded for Best Buys as ""F666 the Police""), the effect is slightly jarring. While Hodgy's Flocka homage and producer Left Brain's turn as Timbaland circa ""We Need a Resolution"" work just fine, Tyler tells a strikingly vivid story of getting pulled over and murdering a cop in what is easily the most accomplished verse on the album. BlackenedWhite is the most fun Odd Future release (excepting, arguably, the collaborative mixtapes) and it's one of the easier to digest, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny in the way that Tyler's or Earl's work does. This cleaned up version of the album also puts a stronger concentration on the Left Brain productions that lean heavy on Southern rap. Replacing the distinctly Tyler-esque ""Chordaroy"" and ""Loco"", as well as the trifles ""Stripclub"" and ""Gram"", are the aforementioned new tracks, both of which call back to the beats that the Neptunes used to give to Clipse. The result is both a more succinct and cohesive full-length. The catch-22 for MellowHype is that while their centrism certainly has its merits, their music is unlikely to convert anyone that has, at this point, already written off Odd Future. Which leaves them with a solid, fun rap album to satiate a feverish cult and a growing number of casual fans.

Meine Zarten Pfoten,Ada,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03eea9e61561daa65bf/1:1/w_160/40c67842.jpg,2011-07-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15675-meine-zarten-pfoten/,Pampa,"While Michaela Dippel, aka Ada, isn't quite a household name in the electronic music world, she has two very solid albums under her belt: 2004's beat workout Blondie and 2009's LP-length Kompkat mix Adaptations. The latter was especially appealing for its balance of ambient techno and pop, and it brought together disparate artists like Tracey Thorn and DJ Koze in a way that felt natural and fun. You could recommend it to somebody without much interest in minimal techno and be pretty confident they'd dig it. So it's reasonable to anticipate good things from Ada's latest, Meine Zarten Pfoten, but the album defies expectations to the point that it's actually kind of puzzling. Rather than embrace her techno past or more fully flesh out Adaptation's mixed-genre approach, what Ada does here is go almost completely soft pop. Like, ""Girl From Ipanema"" soft pop. Now, I think there's a kernel of a good idea here, maybe something building out from Saint Etienne's elegant travelogue music, but what we get feels tamer than that. Songs like opener ""Faith"" are so airy and peaceful that they seem flat, and there's generally a weird avoidance of beats. It's hard to imagine ""Likely""-- composed mainly of acoustic guitar strumming and chintzy organ-- being worse off with some force behind it. If that sounds harsh, it's because I think Ada is capable of stronger material, and she shows that during the record's second half. Here, the pillowy folk vibe that occurs throughout much of Meine Zarten Pfoten (which tellingly translates to ""my tender paws"") breaks up some to reveal tracks that are more dynamic and tightly constructed. You've got stuff like ""At the Gate"", patient deep house that builds to a hypnotic climax, and ""Intro"" (strangely not the first song), which is rich ambient techno that showcases Ada's gifts for texture and slow burn. The thing about these highlights, though, is that they're quite separate from the rest of the LP-- different enough in tone and style that they almost don't fit. Together with the ultra-mellow atmosphere, this lack of cohesion makes the album feel messy, and maybe worse, a little boring.","Rather than embrace her techno past or more fully flesh out the mixed-genre approach of 2009's Adaptations, Ada goes soft pop on her new LP.

Joint Ventures,Baobinga and Co.,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b044c0084474cd0c1bfa/1:1/w_160/cc1d72af.jpg,2011-07-28 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15677-joint-ventures/,Build,"Creatively, UK bass music can be a loner's game, but Baobinga has been doing things a little differently. Joint Ventures, the Bristol-via-Manchester producer's new LP-- and the first one released on his Build label-- is crammed with so many collaborations, both unreleased and previously heard, that the artist credit lists ""Baobinga and Co."" Baobinga's early material primarily featured snapping, neck-whipped breaks, but his run of credit-sharing singles on Build has revealed a chameleonic streak. Joint Ventures shows just how well Binga plays with others. The slithering synth ride ""Heartburst Riddim"", with fellow Bristol low-end addict Ginz, deserves high marks right off the bat. Indeed, Joint Ventures reaches its highest highs when Binga teams with other artists from the city known for its sharply melodic ""purple"" style: Hyetal adds chaos to Binga's sweeping sound on ""Anything For Now"", while both sides of Build's latest single, Guido collab ""Ballin'"" b/w ""Bumba"", manage to evoke moonlit urban areas consisting of negative space, electricity, and precious little else. ""Wang It"", which features frequent collaborator I.D., is fun and punchy; less so is ""Barbakan"", a team-up with Manchester up-and-comer xxxy that plays to neither artist's talents while steadily whirring along with a house-inflected groove. A few other cuts could have been shaved off of Joint Ventures' already daunting 76-minute run time. While Untold's remix of Binga's ""Ride It"" is hard and techno-tunneled-- typical for the London producer-- it doesn't make much sense alongside the collection's vibrant, colorful tunefulness; Baobinga and Randomer's ""Crom2"" suffers a similar fate. Likewise, Rider Shafique collab ""Gun Talk"" is for fans only, and I'm not sure we needed Binga and I.D.'s remix of Roska's remix of ""Tongue Riddim"" (although it sounds pretty good nonetheless). Paradoxically, the most impressive turn on this guest-packed LP comes from Baobinga's only solo cut, ""Make Me Feel"", which sounds as if its clapping beat and unfurling layers of sensuous synths could go on for hours past its current four minutes and change. Yeah, friends are nice, but sometimes things work out even better when you do them by yourself.","Bristol-via-Manchester bass producer Baobinga's first LP on his Build label is crammed with so many collaborations he shares the artist credit.

Capricorn Rising EP,Mike Simonetti,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04513d197565213a42f/1:1/w_160/a6762ff5.jpg,2011-07-28 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15678-capricorn-rising-ep/,Italians Do It Better,"Earlier this year, Mike Simonetti released a limited-edition picture disc of disco re-edits called I'm Getting Too Old for This Shit. Age has nothing to to with it, but the New Jersey-based founder of the labels Troubleman Unlimited, Italians Do It Better, and, most recently, Perseo, has without a doubt enjoyed a lengthy and meandering role in the world of relatively underground music. For all the many releases Simonetti has overseen at his labels, ranging from hardcore to Italo disco, Capricorn Rising is the first record of original material to appear solely under his own name. On the evidence here, Simonetti is definitively not too old for this, though like many artists with full creative control he can sometimes be a bit indulgent. At nearly 39 minutes, the EP is longer than plenty of albums, but 21 of those minutes are given over to a single song, advance mp3 ""Third of the Storms"", which appears in three separate instances. Mesmerizing chill-out disco that sets an innocently chiming melody atop handclaps, driving krautrock bass, droning washes of synth, and occasional idyllic sound effects, the song makes a fine bookend to the record: On the opening, vocal version, Australian electro-R&B smoothie Sam Sparro adds multi-layered, chant-like repetitions conveying a sense of joyful fatalism, while the closing, instrumental take leaves more room for the track to breathe; each is excellent depending on your mood, though as with disco singles like this since time immemorial, you probably won't want to listen to both cuts in the same sitting (that's not a criticism). As a centerpiece, though, ""Third of the Storms (Acapulco)"" disappoints; more or less five minutes of Sparro's already-familiar incantations over sparse, monotonous backing, it almost could have been called ""Third of the Storms (A Cappella)"". Elsewhere, Capricorn offers another four cuts in a similarly hypnotic, synth-based mold. The best is the title track, with pulse-raising electronics and wisps of breath that suggest a mechanically precise jogger; Blade Runner would be too obvious a reference point for a crate digger like Simonetti, but given this track's sci-fi synthesis of chilly electronics and thriller suspense, a comparison to that classic film (and its equally classic score by Vangelis) can't be too far off the mark. Just as seamless is pounding synth workout ""Song for Luca"", the longest non-""Third of the Storms"" piece here, building to a climax that belies its Balearic calm. Simonetti also detours into humming ambient textures, on ""Dust Devil"", and a mournful keyboard reflection, ""Renko's Theme"", which has a rich, yacht-friendly pomp. The end result is a worthwhile stepping-out EP from a longtime behind-the-scenes player, and if its worst crime is excess, well, we're talking about a record with an ice cream sundae on the cover.","The New Jersey-based founder of the labels Troubleman Unlimited, Italians Do It Better, and Perseo steps out with an atmospheric post-disco EP.

Running Blind EP,Philip Selway,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03b9d034d5c69bf483c/1:1/w_160/696f63b7.jpg,2011-07-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15673-running-blind-ep/,NonesuchBella Union,"I keep trying to forget who I'm listening to when I listen to Running Blind, as though distancing myself from the associations I have with Philip Selway will help me to hear it as if it were made by a fresh name. I want to be able to judge it outside the shadow of Radiohead, the band Selway drums for, but I'm not sure that's really even possible. As Mark Pytlik did last year in his review of Selway's debut solo LP, Familial, I give Selway all the credit in the world for stepping out on his own and responding to a singing and songwriting muse that's never going to become a part of Radiohead's music. To make such straightforward singer-songwriter music only increases the challenge. It leaves him exposed as a performer in a way he's normally not when he's at the drum kit. Familial was OK: a couple of memorable tracks and a lot of pretty filler. Running Blind comprises four songs that were left over when Familial was completed. One of them, ""What Goes Around"", was included as a bonus track in demo form on that album and gets fleshed out here. And Running Blind is... OK. It does move the sound on a bit-- Familial was almost self-consciously sparse, as though Selway wanted to distance it as much as possible from Radiohead and that band's mastery of texture and electronics in the context of songs. Running Blind opens up a little to the soundscape, though we're nowhere near The King of Limbs territory in that respect. The additions here are more like textural dressing for Selway's delicate, almost-whispered singing, which hasn't changed from the LP. The new take on ""What Goes Around"" is the most compelling thing Selway has released under his own name. This has little to do with the arrangement, though, and everything to do with the fact that he strongly delivers a well-crafted melody, and the textural elements of the music pick up the thread from there to emphasize certain feelings implied in the lyrics. The other songs move with a bit less purpose-- Selway is getting good at setting a mood with his songs, as he does with a little Theremin and a brief wordless harmony passage on the title track, but there's very little energy in the music, and the tone doesn't vary much. The vaguely tribal drumming on ""Every Spit and Cough"" adds a little variety, but it can't quite get out from under its blanket of ambient keyboard and low-volume vocals. The EP reinforces the impression created by the debut that Selway only really runs in one gear on his own. Running Blind is a slight improvement on its predecessor, but its true saving grace may be a run time so short (15 minutes) that it doesn't have a chance to tranquilize the listener fully. Selway is creeping toward making something that stands well on its own, but he's not quite there yet.","Radiohead drummer follows his solo debut, last year's Familial, with four more tracks of singer-songwriter fare, now slightly more open to textures.

What's Going On [40th Anniversary Edition],Marvin Gaye,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b046ea9e61561daa65cf/1:1/w_160/37ee9e4b.jpg,2011-07-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15679-whats-going-on-40th-anniversary-edition/,InterscopeMotownInterscopeMotown,"Marvin Gaye submitted a version of the most important single of his career, ""What's Going On"", to Motown Records in the summer of 1970. Over the previous seven years, the relationship between the singer and his label was contentious yet fruitful; gritty uptempo songs like ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" and ""Hitch Hike"" were hits, but they undermined Gaye's dream to be a balladeer in the mold of Nat King Cole. Those lusty trifles also roused the internal conflict between the artist's gospel upbringing and his endless desire for carnal pleasure. And while Gaye aspired to be more than just a singer within Motown's assembly-line chug, his boss, brother-in-law, and fellow hard-headed egoist Berry Gordy Jr. wasn't so crazy about the idea. So when Gordy heard that original ""What's Going On"" mix-- which is included in this box set for the first time-- he rejected the song, reportedly calling it ""the worst thing I've ever heard in my life."" Instead of releasing ""What's Going On"" that fall, Motown put out the Gaye compilation Super Hits, which depicts its clean-shaven star as a cartoon superhero flying through the air and fixing a radio tower as a buxom damsel perilously hangs from his shoulder. But Gaye wanted nothing more than to blow up that gleaming image of himself-- now in his early 30s, he would accept nothing but complete control over his art. And if Motown wasn't going to release his first self-produced song, he wasn't going to make music for Motown. Gaye sat idle for months until his label, desperate to put out something-- anything-- from its biggest solo star, finally eked the single out under Gordy's nose on January 21, 1971. It was an instant success, hitting No. 2 on the pop charts and, perhaps more importantly for Gaye, giving him a win in his constant battle with Gordy, who couldn't deny a smash. Five months later, Marvin Gaye released his full-grown symphony to God, What's Going On, with little resistance. Forty years of ubiquity have made the title track commonplace, so it's easy to forget that the song was the ""most avant-garde hit Motown ever had,"" according to Ben Edmonds' thorough album history What's Going On: Marvin Gaye and the Last Days of the Motown Sound. With this album, Gaye wished to sidestep the sound that made him and others famous during Motown's untouchable 60s run, trading in that trademark big, bright beat for laid-back grooves inspired by Duke Ellington, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, and Santana. And not only was the album a coming-out party for Gaye as a producer and songwriter, he found his signature voice-- soft, floating, airy-- on What's Going On, too. ""I felt like I'd finally learned to sing,"" he told biographer David Ritz. ""I'd been studying the microphone for a dozen years, and I suddenly saw what I'd been doing wrong. I'd been singing too loud."" The record and its creative revelations led to his stunning 70s auteur period, which birthed three more classics: 1973's Let's Get It On, 1976's I Want You, and 1978's Here, My Dear. Yet What's Going On still stands tallest, making this 40th anniversary, 2CD/LP edition more of a welcome reminder than just another eulogy to baby-boomer culture. Much has been made of What's Going On's political bent, and it's true that the music was partially inspired by Marvin's brother Frankie, who had come back from a three-year tour of Vietnam, along with troublingly violent episodes like the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kent State shootings that saw four students killed by national guardsmen. Songs like peace-espousing title track and ""What's Happening Brother"", which finds Gaye expressing a war veteran's helplessness upon returning home, show Marvin's dismay toward his country and government. But this album isn't just a protest time capsule. Far from it. Gaye's disappointment isn't just societal, it's personal as well. During this period, the singer had lost his duet partner and dear friend, Tammi Terrell, and his marriage to Gordy's sister Anna was violently breaking down, and he was being tailed by the IRS for unpaid back taxes. His resulting depression is evident throughout; What's Going On isn't a fiery album filled with timely sloganeering. Part of its long-lasting appeal involves an element of true-to-life resignation. ""Who's willing to try to save a world/ That's destined to die,"" he sings on ""Save the Children"", pinpointing an American melancholia-- a mix of world-saving power and funereal inevitability-- that endures today. But the album doesn't wallow, either. It hums and glides on the effortless, multi-tracked Marvins that swoop through the stereo spectrum like ghosts. Gaye's signature vocal ad libs started here and have endured through R&B and hip-hop ever since. His marijuana-soaked delivery, along with the album's mutating, percussion-fueled rhythms, majestic strings, and jazzy horns, give the affair levity. Perhaps this smooth front also has to do with the fact that Gaye was ""hardly an activist in the traditional sense,"" according to Edmonds. While his Vietnam-battered brother was an emotional catalyst, Gaye had neglected to send him one letter during his army stint. And though he was certainly aware of the Detroit race riot that left 43 people dead in 1967, he viewed the sad display on TV from his cushy home on the outskirts of town. Not to say Gaye didn't wholeheartedly believe in the progressive observations found on What's Going On, but his relative distance from his subjects allows him to fly over top of them, providing a healing pulse to the disarray below. For an album as timeless as this one, reissue bonus material can provide worthy footnotes to the main article. Probably thanks to the last decade's vinyl resurgence, this 40th anniversary edition immediately sets itself apart from 2001's 30th anniversary release by presenting its iconic cover in a glorious 12""x12"" square. The package's lone LP features the more straightforward, early Detroit mix of the album, while the final, L.A. mix is relegated to a CD. For die-hards, the most alluring part of the package may be the second compact disc, which features 18 mostly instrumental demos recorded in Gaye's post-What's Going On honeymoon period, when his vast artistic ambitions and abilities were being embraced by the greater public. These somewhat experimental demos-- deep, in-the-pocket funk in the vein of Sly Stone, George Clinton, and Jimi Hendrix-- clearly laid the groundwork for much of his subsequent 70s material. Though he doesn't sing on most of these tracks, it's exciting to hear him get loose as keyboardist and band leader. Just as What's Going On marked the emergence of Marvin Gaye as an all-in-one talent, it also signaled the decline of Motown's reign. It's tempting to simply side with Gaye in his battles with the label that raised him and play into the auteur myth. But it's more complicated than that. Without his tutelage at Motown, first as a session player then as a singer, Gaye wouldn't have been able to conceive a work like this. The help of Motown backing band the Funk Brothers-- credited in the What's Going On liner notes after years of anonymity-- was also essential. Before he was shot and killed by his own father at age 44 in 1984, Gaye was afforded the schooling of America's finest pop academy and then the freedom to flourish and act on his own whims afterward. His 70s brilliance is unfathomable without his 60s pop triumphs. And What's Going On is the turning point, the moment when he was able to bypass his selfishness and self-destructiveness in the name of God, peace, love. It's a nice dream. One that he knew was too good to last. ""Mercy, mercy me,"" he pleaded calmly, desperately.","The classic 1971 LP, a landmark for Gaye and pop music at large, is reissued in a deluxe package including an early mix and demos.

Canopy EP,Painted Palms,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afec9d034d5c69bf47b8/1:1/w_160/cfb3c9f7.jpg,2011-07-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15601-canopy-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Painted Palms' debut EP Canopy feels instantly nostalgic, and I realize that's about as helpfully descriptive in 2011 as saying ""it has keyboards."" If only it were merely the typically fond recollection of Toejam & Earl or Kid and Play's filmography or some other token of childhood ephemera. Nah, Painted Palms get me thinking more existentially-- is it possible to be nostalgic for something that's not even really over? Or, to put it another way, is the churn for subgenres so incessant that Painted Palms' ""psych-pop collage"" is already second-gen while the likes of Keepaway and Sun Airway have achieved the role of elder statesmen? Hell, the Bay Area duo probably just wanted to make a breezy and listenable EP, which they've done to a certain extent. But dig their turquoise and gold-lashed cover art, whimsical name, and an admirable if not particularly achievable promise of ""Brill Building pop, buoyant electronics, and encompassing textural experimentation."" I doubt Painted Palms had their ""burning bush"" moment immediately after hearing ""Lion in a Coma"" for the first time, but it's in the dead center of the post-Merriweather Post Pavilion status quo: jangly guitars replaced by swirling sampler emission, verses and choruses traded for alternating chants, bummed indifference scrapped in favor of wonderment at our own functionality. Meanwhile, all space filled with so much aquatic burbling that hydrogen and oxygen deserve songwriting credits. It's the same old vanilla indie rock, albeit dipped in rainbow sprinkles. But just because Painted Palms don't really do anything new doesn't mean they can't do it well. They're definitely not trying to come off like some lo-fi bedroom act with a Korg and a dream, and the production is slick, loud, and full-bodied. The same goes for Reese Donohue's vocals, undeniably derivative but nonetheless committed to its swooping derring-do without using reverb or dulling overdubs as a safety net. On the summer-lovin' title track, Donohue sings, ""We climbed up to the rooftops so we could feel the air... your hand was touching mine but I barely felt it at all,"" making sure you can still feel the butterflies. Painted Palms are catchy enough to grab your attention within the first minute during your daily mp3 blog recon, but they lack the personality to really stick. This is particularly true of ""Falling Asleep"", which introduces an instantly likeable melody before quickly getting distracted by strings of spangly electro baubles, while ""Water Hymn"" and the title track simply tread in whirlpools of squishy atmopsherics. I mean, I know it's also reductive to say that the vocal triggers and thumping house beat of ""All of Us"" really hope you haven't heard Delorean's ""Seasun"" while Donohue's vocals sound exactly like Panda Bear to the point where ignoring it is lying by omission. But all you're really left with here are the RIYLs instead of an identity Painted Palms can call their own.","This Bay Area duo is another entry in the post-Animal Collective dream-pop stakes, with swirling electronics and songs about water and sleep.

Gold Rings and Fur Pelts,Molly Sweeney,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b039ea9e61561daa65b9/1:1/w_160/07c74666.jpg,2011-07-27 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15671-gold-rings-and-fur-pelts/,Syren,"Gold Rings and Fur Pelts is the debut solo album from Montreal singer-songwriter Molly Sweeney, but it is not the first time she has made her presence known in grand fashion. She first made a memorable appearance on Land of Kush's 2009 album Against the Day, writing lyrics and showcasing her powerhouse vocal chops on the epic ""Bilocations"". Since then, she has gone on to perform both live and on record with Sam Shalabi and the various incarnations of his ambitious Land of Kush project, and a healthy trace of that outsized ambition has evidently rubbed off on Sweeney. Gold Rings and Fur Pelts splits its attention between intimate psych-folk and stylized chamber-pop, often with an emphasis on mood and atmosphere rather than songcraft. As a vocalist, Sweeney is a remarkable talent. Her elliptical songwriting and acoustic instrumentation have already led to some inevitable comparisons to Joanna Newsom, but that seems to me a bit misleading. Sweeney has a multi-octave range that lends her vocals considerably more versatility than Newsom's, and in its lower registers her voice can recall classic Joni Mitchell or Judee Sill before then soaring upwards in wild swoops reminiscent of Josephine Foster. Sweeney herself alludes to Marianne Faithfull with one title here, ""Not Faithfull"", a nice homage that seems another red herring-- she's got innumerable cartons of cigarettes ahead of her before she can approximate Faithfull's rasp. With Sweeney's voice as the music's constantly shifting center, she and co-producer Radwan Moumneh surround her performances with discrete orchestration, using an extended group comprised largely of various Land of Kush and Constellation label veterans. Together, they produce moments of aching loveliness, such as the shivery cello and viola that opens ""Spirit, Will I See You"" or the spot-on woodwinds that encircle the opening ""Swollen"". Ultimately, however, Sweeney and the group are not able to disguise the impression that most of these songs are just not quite there. Despite, or perhaps because of, her ambitious style as a songwriter, Sweeney does not sound much interested in repeating choruses or crafty pop hooks. This tendency doesn't matter as much on the detail-oriented ""Spirit, Will I See You"" or the ornate, jazzy closer ""Radiant Sun"", which maintain interest through their ever-changing color palettes. But without memorable hooks, Sweeney's simpler, folky pieces such as ""Florida"" or ""Full Moon"" are rendered meandering and aimless, and border dangerously close to generic, Jewel-like coffeehouse pop. At the other end of the spectrum, the album's title track is a daring pastiche of Argentinean tango, enlivened by Sweeney's full-throated vocals and French lyrics, yet it is unconvincing as anything but a diverting bit of theater. The album's lyrics are also a stumbling block. In several instances Sweeney's lyrics seem to have been written in a strange rush, leading to clunky rhymes (""You were fit once, just like a god/ A sweet young child in a grown-up's bod"") that can stop an otherwise sophisticated song dead in its tracks. Here again, her ambition seems to have gotten the best of her, as on ""Eros and Psyche"" whose mythic title might suggest a lavish narrative but instead details a romantic encounter (""His hands were softer than a breeze/ I'd put my fingers in his curls/ That gathered like the tops of trees"") better suited to a Harlequin paperback. These distractions accumulate enough to leave Gold Rings and Fur Pelts a tantalizing misfire, one that can hopefully be improved upon once Sweeney manages to bring her extraordinary voice and grand songwriting ambitions into tighter focus.","Montreal singer-songwriter works with scene vet Sam Shalabi and others in the Constellation stable on an album of colorful psych-folk.

The Last Place,Army Navy,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0379d034d5c69bf4834/1:1/w_160/1d3ccf82.jpg,2011-07-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15668-the-last-place/,Fever Zone,"When it started going around that lovelorn L.A. indie popsters Army Navy's sophomore set, The Last Place, would be a song cycle about a relationship gone awry, a writer friend made an excellent point: The funniest thing about a power-pop concept album about being torn apart by love is that every power-pop album is a concept album about being torn apart by love. But while Army Navy's dissection of those post-relationship stages of grief over chiming guitars might seem old hat to fans of the genre, here familiarity mostly works in their favor. As on their self-titled debut, Army Navy's jangly chords, insistent rhythms, and lyrical treatises on love cop copiously from the heroes of the form: Teenage Fanclub, the Posies, and Big Star, with even a little Superchunkian heft on the burlier numbers. But, as our Jayson Greene pointed out in his review of the band's self-titled debut, ""being a well-studied song encyclopedia is half the point"" of pure power pop like Army Navy's. While many close readings of the heartbroken past ring out on The Last Place, they're never so studious as to be dull. The playing's always spirited, producer Adam Lasus lends the disc a warm, ingratiating sound, and the songs are both taut and well-considered in their arrangements. The Last Place is punchy and stately alike; the hooks aren't necessarily the skull-sticking kind on first pass, but they're easy enough on the ears to keep you listening, and crafty enough to burrow their way in after prolonged exposure. Army Navy's note-perfect mining of the classics isn't merely musical. Frontman Justin Kennedy's woebegone lyrics about the one who got away-- who, it comes out in fits and spurts throughout The Last Place, may've been a celebrity, and may not've exactly been unattached-- hew almost as closely to classic power-pop tropes. Melodically, the homage-heavy style works wonders. Kennedy's tunes don't just hark back to Bandwagonesque or Frosting on the Beater; they could proudly stand beside them. Kennedy's words, a balance of imagistic detail, self-reflection, and a sort of standard-issue pop yearning, aren't always quite as successful. Juicy as Kennedy's ruminations on his soured romance can be (""Maybe it's your celebrity/ That makes you want it slum it with me""; ""There she goes/ Goddamnit, he knows""), when he drops the narrative conceit, at times his pining feels a bit shopworn. ""I know that I'm right/ But I don't want to fight for you,"" Kennedy moans at one point in ""Wonderland to Waterloo"". For every big reveal on The Last Place, there's a line or two of textbook hurt-speak like that one. There's a good reason for this occasional aversion to detail; Kennedy is, after all, still attempting to conceal the identity of his ex-love even while reliving their downfall, and since he's recalling feelings and events concurrently, the whole thing's bound to get a bit tangled. A close study of The Last Place does prove reasonably revealing as to Kennedy's post-breakup headspace, gradually moving from just before the split to the estrangement to something like acceptance; more than that, though, the pain of it all is plain as day in his voice. But those looking for some sort of indie-TMZ from The Last Place are bound for a letdown; no names are named, Kennedy looks inward more often than outward, and any dirt being dished can't sully Army Navy's meticulous music. True, a bit more of the sordid stuff would've lent these tunes a bit more of an edge. But The Last Place is long enough on melodic details, it can afford to play the lyrical kind a little closer to the chest.","Familiarity mostly works in the L.A. indie popsters' favor on their taut, tuneful second album, a song cycle about a relationship gone awry.

Because listening to their debut album, Through the Green, it is blindingly, stupidly obvious that they love loops. Though they belong to a tradition of disco and funk edits that dates back to the early 1980s (a tradition that saw a major revival in the last half-decade), they've essentially applied power pop's maxims-- all the good stuff, over and over again-- to their source material. Instead of economical verses and choruses, they offer two- and three-second cuts of classic boogie. The resulting tracks shun subtlety and build, instead aiming to fill every available space with curlicues of melody and rhythm. The tracks on Through the Green are long-- really long, often eclipsing eight minutes-- but they don't offer narcotic repetition. Tiger & Woods differentiate themselves from a lot of ace editors because they don't ever want you to ""lose yourself"" in the track; they want to share these wonderful little slivers they've excised. Slivers so wonderful, in fact, that they want to share them over and over again. If a peer like the excellent Mark E is searching for disco's negative space, Tiger & Woods are amping up its most neon bits. (I find them more tractable and focused than the nonetheless wonderful Justin Vandervolgen and Dr. Dunks.) The music is inherently social and gregarious; it's music that makes me want to be around people because it feels so generous. It's not a good-times party album so much as it's an album about the good times. Tiger & Woods seem uniquely concerned with those communal moments when the DJ finds the perfect pitch and groove, and Through the Green is their extended exploration of those highs. The album flatly ignores those periods during which the DJ is grasping or when disco spirals off into floral wanderlust. Its lack of emotional dynamics and its 80-minute runtime occasionally dull the festivities, but they never cheapen the blissful sonic moments the duo arrives at. It helps that the lyrical themes that exist-- dance-y platitudes about love and heat, mostly-- never feel sexual or overbearing. The duo's best song-- a song I have can confidently call my favorite disco edit ever-- ""Gin Nation"", contorts Imagination's ""Music & Lights"" into a blissful, energetic whirl. The money line-- ""Sequins and pearls/ And lots of pretty girls""-- is stretched to sound like ""We got/ Plenty of girls,"" a goofy declaration of the party's success. The duo has called their sound ""future boogie,"" but they only occasionally-- usually when working with the equally anonymous female vocalist 'Em-- wander into modern R&B, modern here meaning mid-80s Jam & Lewis. On the excellent ""Curb My Heart"", she navigates the duo's sardine-tight chord changes until she too is sampled and threaded into the pattern. They're impatient like this, never wanting to wait for the best parts to cycle through again. It's a childish impulse, in some ways, but one I understand fully. Through the Green can scan as simple or nostalgic, but either misses the point (and neither is the album a ""modern take"" on disco). It's an album of execution, of Tiger & Woods sharing sounds that aren't elusive and chasing feelings that are. The core question is, ""Can we have too much of a good thing?"" and while I can convince myself the answer is probably ""yes,"" I'm glad Tiger & Woods can't.","This reclusive duo takes a crowd-pleasing approach to disco edits, packing its tracks with nothing but generous highlights.

Sorry 4 the Wait,Lil Wayne,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b033ea9e61561daa65ab/1:1/w_160/afa389fd.jpg,2011-07-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15663-sorry-4-the-wait/,,"Lil Wayne spends so much of Sorry 4 the Wait, his new mixtape, rapping about guns and drugs and sex that it's easy to miss one telling little lyrical detail. Rapping over Rick Ross associate Gunplay's riotous bass-bomb ""Rollin'"", Wayne says, ""I cut down on the syrup/ Now I'm in better shape."" That qualifies as a big admission for Wayne. Back when he was on his historic mid-2000s mixtape rampage, Wayne's constant consumption of codeine cough syrup, a drug that has contributed to the death of more than a couple of Southern rap legends, was a genuine cause for concern. But Wayne's on parole now after serving eight months in Rikers Island. He has a whole lot of consequences in store if he gets caught with drugs anytime soon. Wayne's bottomless appetites once informed both his public persona and his firing-in-every-direction, mad-genius rap style. But on Sorry 4 the Wait, he sounds at least somewhat reserved and controlled; that sense that he could fly off into pure gibberish at any moment is gone. Unlike Dedication 2 or Da Drought 3, Sorry 4 the Wait sounds like the work of a mortal human being. Happily, that mortal human being still happens to be very good at rapping. Wayne's actually having an excellent 2011. On Sorry 4 the Wait, he revives his old mixtape trick of rapping over a bunch of the songs currently tearing up rap radio. It feels a bit incomplete, though, since so many of those songs-- the ones conspicuously absent from the tape-- already feature Lil Wayne rapping on them: Chris Brown's ""Look at Me Now"", DJ Khaled's ""I'm on One"", Ace Hood's ""Hustle Hard Remix"", Wayne's own ""6 Foot 7 Foot"" and ""John"". On those tracks, Wayne sounds like a man possessed, completely missing the rust and out-of-time lostness that affects so many rappers just out of prison. (Wayne's time in prison was short, and it ended several months ago, which almost certainly has something to do with his relative freshness. Still, it's notable and impressive.) Relative to those tracks, he sounds subdued and uncommitted through most of Sorry 4 the Wait. The title itself speaks to a certain just-fucking-around modesty; it's just a quick-and-dirty collection thrown out into the world to atone for all the delays in Tha Carter IV's release date. Compare that to his last mixtape, No Ceilings, its title itself an act of sky's-the-limit bravado. Even when Wayne dropped No Ceilings nearly two years ago, it seemed weirdly lazy and passe for an A-list rapper to drop a mix of freestyles and nothing else; after all, guys like Gucci Mane crank out entire tapes of fully realized songs at frightening speeds. But if Sorry 4 the Wait is a throwaway, it's an awfully fun one. Occasionally, Wayne will come up with an extended piece of casual, free-associative lyrical inventiveness, like this one, from his version of Miguel's ""Sure Thing"": ""Lord knows I'm a sinner/ Pain pills for dinner/ Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer/ Got a chopper and a trimmer/ Shooting like Jimmer/ You're coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer."" More often, though, he's letting off silly Drake-style hashtag-rap punchlines and sticking with blunt-but-effective Rick Ross rhyme patterns. And yet it mostly works, because it's just a blast to hear him having fun for 41 minutes straight instead. He can get overwhelmingly self-aggrandizing: ""My girl pussy feel like heaven to a god."" He can get goofily puerile, using Drake's gorgeously conflicted sensitive synth-rap confession ""Marvin's Room"" to bust off some irreverently nasty sex talk: ""She take it every way except personal."" He indulges in plenty of singsong cadence, but all of it sounds like rapping, and none of it comes with the Auto-Tune he kept using for too long. When Lil B, a stylistic descendant in many ways, shows up on a freestyle of Waka Flocka Flame's ""Grove St. Party"", Wayne sounds comparatively focused-- and ""focused"" isn't a word I would've used to describe Wayne at any point over the last couple of years. Even on autopilot, as he often is here, Wayne sounds like a man reawakened and re-energized. The most-fun part of the mixtape doesn't really have anything to do with rapping at all. The final track is a six-minute non-rapping rant over the clipped, fired-up dancehall of Beyoncé's ""Run the World (Girls)"" (itself a flip of Major Lazer's ""Pon De Floor""). Wayne's track is a sort of extended multi-tracked ad-lib, with a whole mob of Waynes yelling incoherently throughout. One of those Waynes yells about all the things going right with his life right now: ""I am happy! I'm in love! I'm in love! I picked up a new hobby! I make way too much money! My kids are growing up healthy and beautiful and intelligent! My mom's getting married! Congratulations!"" Another Wayne shouts out an endless parade of random people. Still another indulges in some pure non-sequitur ridiculousness: ""Rest in peace John F. Kennedy! Rest in peace Marilyn Monroe!"" The tape is an encouraging indication that even a cleaned-up Wayne has plenty of insanity left in him. And I, for one, hope that insanity is all over Tha Carter IV.","Unlike Dedication 2 or Da Drought 3, Wayne's new mixtape sounds like the work of a mortal-- who raps very well.

Total,SebastiAn,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03013d197565213a40d/1:1/w_160/493203f6.jpg,2011-07-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15664-total/,Big BeatBecauseEd Banger,"The title track from French producer and Ed Banger affiliate SebastiAn's debut album, Total, runs a little under a minute and a half. But the song's video makes economical use of its time, cramming hundreds of quickly edited pieces of footage both disturbingly violent and explicitly pornographic-- a decapitated body, a woman with a vaginal slit for a face-- into one ADD-affected piece of manufactured shock. Beyond thrill seekers, the meme brigade, and the endless offensiveness of 4chan, it's hard to conceive who the audience for this thing could be. In a way, though, it's representative of the Ed Banger aesthetic: aggressive and in your face, but not exactly where you look for deeper meaning. Aggressiveness is still the name of the game on Total. The album's 52 minutes are packed with nasty-sounding, repetition-heavy grindhouse electro. SebastiAn's score for last year's Romain Gavras film Notre Jour Viendra showcased a more subtle, classical-indebted side, with warmly foreboding strings; you do get a glimpse of that here, albeit very briefly, on 45-second interlude ""Night"" and harpsichord-smothered ""Tetra"". Otherwise, if your familiarity with Ed Banger reaches as far as ""those guys with the light-up cross,"" you know not to expect much in terms of nuance. In the current dance music climate, Total's sound comes across as crassly commercial and ultimately dated-- sometimes literally, as in the inclusion of grating years-old singles ""Ross Ross Ross"" and ""Motor"". Total's most compelling moments dial back the frizzy, hard-hitting stuff in favor of smoother fare reminiscent of fellow Parisian crate digger Onra's R&B odysseys. Single ""Embody"" has a particularly slinking appeal, while the effervescence of ""Arabest"" and ""Yes"" is infectious. Most surprising of all is Mayer Hawthorne-featuring ""Love in Motion"", where the white-bread soul dude drops an enjoyably muted vocal over mutant bass and crisp handclaps. (Elsewhere, the album's other high-profile guest, M.I.A., barely coughs on ""C.T.F.O."", a rote slice of churlish bass music.) Highlights aside, Total's belligerence is as predictable as it is teeth-grinding. With rumors abounding that Ed Banger princes Justice are ditching their previous sound almost entirely in favor of hard-rock textures, SebastiAn may have given us the closest thing we'll get this year to what people would expect from a new Justice album. And that's a depressing notion.","The Ed Banger-affiliated French producer's debut album is packed with nasty-sounding, repetition-heavy grindhouse electro.

Night Gallery,Eternal TapestrySun Araw,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02c13d197565213a406/1:1/w_160/3a750486.jpg,2011-07-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15657-night-gallery/,Thrill Jockey,"For the past couple of years, Eternal Tapestry and Sun Araw have been gliding along parallel paths. The Portland-bred space-rock group and the Long Beach-based vibe merchant both skew toward the softer side of psychedelia, using primitivist improvisation and a palette of mellow sounds to generate potent new age zone-outs. Night Gallery, a 40-minute jam session recorded last year for Austin's KVRX FM, brings them together with unsurprisingly trippy results. Tapestry's Dewey Mahood and Nick Bindeman take the lead, playing expansive guitar solos while Araw's Cameron Stallones supplies heady textures on flute and keyboard. The rhythm section, comprising drummer Jed Bindeman and bassist Yoni Kifle, mostly lays low. Night Gallery is still, slowly evolving music, where the perspective shifts gradually if at all. The performance has been edited into four suites, but it flows like a single, continuous piece. Imagine King Tubby crashing an all-night Crazy Horse rehearsal, or a mixtape compiled from a decade's worth of ""Dark Star"" bootlegs (which exists, actually). While Eternal Tapestry and Sun Araw are of a similarly mystical bent, their methods differ. The former is a fairly traditional rock ensemble, complete with guitars, drums, and even the odd saxophone solo. Stallones' approach-- using cassette loops as a rhythmic foundation for lush and lightly funky guitar twiddling-- is less familiar. The music on his 2010 2xLP, On Patrol, sounded like it drifted in from a third-world sci-fi metropolis. Night Gallery shifts back and forth between these two feels. With dense drones and wah-wah gurgles, ""Night Gallery I"" tilts heavily toward Sun Araw's dub-inflected territory. Nine minutes later, the burden shifts. On ""Night Gallery II"", he's a supporting player, slipping organ gurgles into Tapestry's tumbling rave-up. During the fourth and final suite, the group follows a steady organ pulse through 14-minutes of abstract doodles, refusing to congeal around a single melody for more than a few moments. It's either an admirable display of restraint or adequate evidence of inebriation, but the track excellently subverts space-rock clichés. The predictable part where everybody locks and hits the gas never arrives. Eternal Tapestry and Sun Araw share an affinity for foggy-headed 1970s experimental outfits Cluster and Popol Vuh, but the performance on Night Gallery has a less sinister and more laid-back, ambling feel that's more in line with the Grateful Dead. There are bum notes, and rhythms that wander. But Eternal Tapestry and Sun Araw mesh well. When they hit a groove, they're a match made in a UV lamp-lit and sage-scented stoner-rock heaven.","The Portland-bred space-rockers and Long Beach-based vibe merchant come together for a 40-minute Austin jam session, with trippy results.

Random Axe,Random Axe,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9513d197565213a2e5/1:1/w_160/732d5beb.jpg,2011-07-26 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15526-random-axe/,Duckdown,"Random Axe, a hip-hop supergroup teaming Brooklyn's Sean Price with Detroit's Guilty Simpson and Black Milk, was announced in 2008. When Pitchfork spoke to Milk two years ago, he said Random Axe's debut album was 80% complete, which means either a) the group left a number of old tunes on the cutting floor and started nearly from scratch or b) it really took them 24 months to hash out one-fifth of an album. Random Axe is officially here, but it doesn't sound like the kind of product sprung from years of work. The group addresses its mission statement early on, as Price rhymes, ""No love-letter rhymes and raps about chicks/ Just whole lot of druggin' and thuggin', that's it."" Single-mindedness aside, all three rappers are very good at what they do here. Simpson, with his no-frills wordplay, makes for an exceptional supporting player, and even sounds inspired on ""Never Back Down"". Milk brings his skill as a producer over to his rapping, applying a percussive flow. As for Price, he's already well-noted for a wickedly dark sense of humor, using tricky internal rhyme patterns to levy his hilarious threats. Milk makes all the album's beats, which range from fair to excellent. He chops and flips samples with a studious flair, while drums, no matter how dirty and muffled, all thump like kicks to the chest. The visceral ""The Hex"" is interrupted by live drum fills, while an eerie twinkle floats over the staccato drums of ""The Karate Kid"". But a producer's job is more than making beats and recording vocals. It's also about drawing the best performances from all of the album's participants, and Random Axe feels carelessly phoned in at times. Most of the songs on Random Axe follow an uncomplicated template: Spit 16 bars and get the fuck out of the way. The only track that deviates from this formula is ""Everybody Nobody Somebody"", where each rapper takes a word from the song's title and uses it as the root of their verse on the song, with limp results. In fact, the most surprising lyrical moments on the album come when Price, notorious for his thug persona, says both that he's happily married and no longer smokes weed. The members of another rap supergroup, Slaughterhouse, sound like four solo rappers on the same song-- clearly failing to grasp the concept of the word ""group""-- but at least they make a concentrated effort to out-rap each other. On Random Axe, the verses are reliably good, but the tedium of clock punching replaces the spirit of competition. The quality improves in every category when the album's two biggest guest stars join the proceedings. Over the high-pitched West Coast gangsta-rap synths of ""Jahphy Joe"", Random Axe is joined by recent Fool's Gold signee Danny Brown, whose pill-popping lunacy is infectious. The album's shining moment, ""Chewbacca"", is heightened by the appearance of New York rap phenomenon Roc Marciano, whose economical rhyming shakes both Simpson and Price into focus with their own verses, while Milk's beat manages to render a glittery synth sample into a threatening clarion call. It makes you wonder what would have happened if all of Random Axe carried this same sense of urgency. For one, the album probably wouldn't have taken Milk, Price, and Simpson nearly three years to complete. But more importantly, it might have ended up being the classic fans were waiting so long for.","Hip-hop supergroup comprising Brooklyn's Sean Price, Detroit's Guilty Simpson, and Black Milk finally releases its long-gestating debut.

Ritual Union,Little Dragon,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03ab1335d7bf169a09a/1:1/w_160/4f9183ed.jpg,2011-07-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15672-ritual-union/,Peacefrog,"Sweden's Little Dragon are a band blessed with a distinct and immediately alluring style. Their rhythms are dry and metronomic; their synthesizers either provide a distant ambiance or seem to glow like neon lights that flicker in time with the beat. Frontwoman Yukimi Nagano's phrasing touches on conventions of modern-- particularly British-- iterations of R&B, but errs on the side of aloof understatement. They are essentially an R&B band, but the major elements of their style are skewed enough that while the music seems vaguely familiar, it doesn't sound quite like anyone else. A lot of listeners had their first exposure to Nagano and Little Dragon last year when the group guest starred on two tracks from the Gorillaz's excellent album Plastic Beach. Gorillaz mastermind Damon Albarn was very clever in his deployment of the band on those cuts, making the shift into a sequence in ""Empire Ants"" highlighting Nagano's smoky, serene voice and Håkan Wirenstrand's stunning keyboard textures seem like a sudden cut from muddy, dimly lit footage to vibrant, super-saturated color. If one of Albarn's goals in collaborating with the band was to showcase their best qualities, he did an amazing job of it. Ritual Union, the band's third album, does not stray from the sexy, futuristic sound of their previous record, Machine Dreams, or their team-up with Albarn. If anything, they've doubled down on their aesthetic by leaning harder than ever on moody synths, nearly subliminal bass lines and impossibly crisp snare hits. A few of the songs, like the sleek title track and the brisk, funky ""Nightlight"", rank among the group's finest work. All through the record, Little Dragon are extremely effective in delivering the most attractive elements of their style, resulting in a set of songs that come across like the ideal soundtrack to a night on the town in some exotic sci-fi city. The problem with Ritual Union is that even though every song on the album is built on the foundation of some very good musical ideas and at least one engaging hook, the material nevertheless seems rather under-written. ""When I Go Out"", ""Please Turn"", and ""Crystalfilm"" all get stuck in groovy ruts, while cuts like ""Little Man"", ""Summertearz"", and ""Brush the Heat"" seem like they are one extra hook, middle eight, rhythmic shift, or chord change away from becoming truly outstanding pieces of music. This doesn't diminish the charm of the music, per se, but it can be very frustrating to hear songs right on the precipice of greatness. Little Dragon have clearly mastered their style on this album; hopefully next time around they will deliver more songs worthy of their sound.","Sweden's Little Dragon have a distinct and immediately alluring style, and on their third album, they double down on their futuristic pop sound.

Just Once EP,How to Dress Well,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0439d034d5c69bf484b/1:1/w_160/83c45db0.jpg,2011-07-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15676-just-once-ep/,Love Letters Ink,"Tom Krell's debut LP as How to Dress Well, last year's Love Remains, consisted mostly of songs gathered from numerous digital EPs he'd been posting on his blog. Love Remains picked the best of these tracks and arranged them into a set that felt like a coherent outline of the project: ethereal home recordings, more about mood and texture than lyrics or melody, that draw from mainstream pop and R&B but transform some of the formal qualities of those genres via a lo-fi, ""feel""-oriented setting. Since then, critics have discussed Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, and other artists alongside How to Dress Well to define a loose trend of the young, urban hip embracing a version of R&B, but to me Krell's music has always sounded more like an art project and less like something that truly touches on what is, after all, a supremely populist (and popular) genre. Without the crackling digital distortion, words buried under a mountain of cheap reverb, and blurred visual imagery, How to Dress Well's songs are skeletal, to say the least. As good as Love Remains was, there was a distinct feeling of ""Where can this project go next?"" It's a common question these days, when adopting a ready-made style is as easy as installing a new Tumblr theme and bands are sometimes more about abstract ideas than individual expression (which shouldn't be taken as a criticism). ""How to Dress Well"" is the ""thing,"" in other words, not any individual song or record; the project itself is where the expressive possibility lies. So how has that project changed? And does it need to? To his credit, Krell took the right tack here by putting out a low-key, limited release built around a different concept, something that in no way feels like a follow-up. Just Once is a four-song EP that collects two previously released tracks bearing the name ""Suicide Dream"", adds a third with that title, and throws in a new version of ""Decisions"", what I would argue is Krell's best track to date. All four songs have been recorded with a string quartet, and the set was inspired by and is dedicated to a friend of Krell's who passed away. There's something a little funny about the idea of going from blown-out lo-fi to a freaking string quartet in the space of a single release. But the truly weird thing about Just Once is how the songs once rendered by Krell's presumably cheap home production don't sound all that different given the conservatory approach here. His vocals are still coated in reverb, the intertwining harmonies still given the same arrangements, and it turns out that those elements are what make How to Dress Well's sound distinct. Just Once still feels slightly crude and handmade, despite the instrumentation involved, and there's no mistaking it for anyone else. The old and new ""Suicide Dream"" tracks work well together to evoke a sense of yearning and loss. And ""Decisions"", with its waltz-time shuffle and signature pause every fourth measure, is still glorious, the sound of a song drawing fuzzy, abstracted versions of about five different emotions and swirling them together into one grand whole. Just Once also serves as a potential argument that How to Dress Well is best in short four- or five-song bursts, the way the first few EPs arrived-- you get the feeling Krell's songs evoke for 18 or 20 minutes, and then you move on. Sure, there's no avoiding the fact that some of these songs are appearing for the third time. The nagging ""what now?"" question isn't going away. But it can be filed away for later.","Tom Krell follows 2010's terrific Love Remains with a low-key, four-song release that affirms there is something special about this project.

3 EP,Inc.,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0345e6ef95969321f2d/1:1/w_160/5d6ba3e2.jpg,2011-07-25 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15661-3-ep/,4AD,"We don't really know each other, but I'm gonna guess that you love Prince. Or, at a minimum, you respect the man even if he really hasn't done much worth a shit in the past 15 years or so. This shouldn't be a problem except there's probably no pop music figure of the past century whose universal acclaim is matched by an almost total inability of his acolytes to create proper homage. We come across respectable integrations of Bowie, Dylan, Lennon, and Brian Wilson, but-- especially amongst rock musicians who use the Purple One's legacy as their mainline to R&B-- the whole of his work is often distilled into a falsetto and a bunch of terrible sexual puns. Well, if Inc. prove anything on their 4AD debut EP 3, it's that you can plunder the lesser-known regions of his discography, boast impressive instrumental chops, and still be no better off than some hapless power trio trying to rip off ""Little Red Corvette"". At its core, Inc. (formerly known as Teen Inc. during their particularly galling 2010 CMJ set) is comprised of Los Angeles-based brothers Daniel and Andrew Aged, both of whom are experienced session musicians. Which shows, not so much in the sense that 3 displays their virtuosity as much as their keytar-swinging live show, though there are plenty of geeky timestamps and frilly synth doodles. It's more in how its overcooked arrangements bear the mark of backup players overcompensating after finally getting ahold of the mixing console, and 3 turns out to be a maximalist grotesquerie of minimal sounds. ""Heart Crimes"" wanders around in search of a tune or even a beat for nearly five minutes while occasionally busying itself with Three 6 Mafia's 32nd-note hi-hats, vocal snippets that drift like paper bags in the wind, and synth slap-bass presets so offbeat they sound more like Spike Jones sound effects. This may not be particularly shocking, but mixing all of those elements turns out to be a total fucking disaster. Slightly more successful are the two tracks that play with straightforward melody. At first glance, the arrhythmic hook of ""Swear"" ingratiates due to its own nagging repetition, but if you're steeped enough in the realm of 1980s radio pop to appreciate Inc.'s simulacra, odds are you'll eventually recognize it as a pretty brazen rip of ""Sussudio"". Not that there's anything inherently wrong with ""Sussudio"", but once that connection is made, it can never go back to being ""Swear"". ""Millionairess"" sounds like a way out of their own rut, or at least a chance to bat one-for-three, but they abandon its quick-hitting chorus for a mess of vocal mutations that barely acknowledge a slowly simmering New Jack Swing beat. Credit where it's due for trying to enter Zapp & Roger and Andre Cymone into the PBR&B conversation without being total ironists, but ""Chromeo, except no fun at all"" isn't what the game's been missing.","Debut 4AD EP from the L.A. brothers and Prince acolytes turns out to be a maximalist grotesquerie of minimal sounds.

Room(s),Machinedrum,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b002b1335d7bf169a044/1:1/w_160/e034e9ce.jpg,2011-07-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/,Planet Mu,"Rarely does a moment pass on Machinedrum's Room(s) during which a human voice isn't present. This wouldn't be noteworthy save for the fact that Room(s) is an electronic album, one (presumably) devoid of its creators voice. Instead, it is stuffed to the gills with harping, distended vocal samples deployed in hypnotic, overlapping curlicues. This style of sample, popularized by UK bass music, at this point has become prevalent enough that it represents modernity-- the sound of contemporary electronic music-- more than any one genre. Still, Machinedrum's Travis Stewart approaches this trend like a glutton. Where peers like Four Tet and Jacques Greene apply these samples in precise, painterly strokes, Stewart gloms them onto the canvas with abandon. In doing so, he seems to suggest that their accumulation, more than their placement or timbre, provides the necessary weight and mysticism. Stewart enjoys these kind of tactful reactions. He's spent 10 years releasing music under the Machinedrum moniker, much of it worthwhile, much of it in widely varying styles of electronic composition, from IDM to deep house and back. Bass music is Stewart's current muse: Earlier this year he released the excellent Fleur 12"" as half of Sepalcure (whose other half, Praveen Sharma, released one of the better bass singles of the year, ""The Year 3000"", as Braille). On Room(s) he takes bass music's vocal samples and strips them of their candor, the sense that they are disassociated from the tech-y fray. They become globs of sound, the primary element around which these tracks are constructed. A collection of active, grazing drum patterns and warm keyboards holds these gobs together. Stewart manages a fair range of styles-- from the pounding, piano-house of ""Come1"" to the opiate shadows of ""Youniverse""-- though nothing escapes those contorted yelps. Those samples-- ululating, detuned, hypnotic-- normalize everything on Room(s), to the point where vastly different tracks are tonally similar. Sometimes, such as on ""GBYE"", he succeeds using short, eager samples, colliding two or three voices together dozens of times in quick succession. The tracks that stray furthest from dance music fare the best: ""Sacred Frequency"" (itself a single, with excellent B-sides, for the record) veers into the gleaming psychedelia of Caribou, while ""Now U Know the Deal 4 Real"" touches on cold, assertive R&B. I want to stress how many listens it takes to suss out even these differences. It's not that they're not real, it's that the shivering vocal timbres dominate the mix to the point where large shifts in tempo and style are obscured. It's during these moments when I think that Room(s) and its elevation of the vocal sample was perhaps a better idea than an album. Still, if you're the type of person who feel hard for Greene's ""Another Girl"" or Burial's shaky ghosts, there's enough hyper-melodic, mush-mouthed whir on Room(s) to reward your time.","Versatile producer infuses his tricky beats with in-vogue vocal samples, which turns out to be both good and bad.

Actually,La Big Vic,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afee13d197565213a388/1:1/w_160/966b35dd.jpg,2011-07-25 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15602-actually/,Underwater Peoples,"La Big Vic bring a few different worlds together on their debut album, and a lot of that can be attributed to each member's background. Keyboardist Peter Pearson has served as an apprentice under Pink Floyd's live sound producer. Before guitarist Toshio Masuda moved from Japan to America, he produced hip-hop, commercials, and soundtracks, and even performed with a boy band. Violinist and lead singer Emilie Friedlander founded the blog Visitation Rites and is currently the editor of Pitchfork's sister site Altered Zones. Together, they make a kind of swirling electronic dream-pop that defies easy categorization. Each member's background is represented equally on Actually, where rap beats nestle comfortably with ambient effects and violins squall around laser-like synthesizers. ""LYNY"", the album's most straightforward song, combines electronic blips and beeps with crashing live drums and swirling guitars to create a colorful, engrossing opener. The disparate elements on ""Heyo (Silver Morning)""-- the metallic clang punctuating every downbeat, the submerged guitars sounding like they're being played in aquarium-sized fish tanks, the blaring violin line-- come together in a natural way. Given the way the band members worked in music individually, it's no surprise that Actually sounds great on a pair of quality headphones. Delivered at languid tempos, the longer-form songs often feel like they're floating, a vibe that ""FAO"" particularly captures, all of its parts coasting in multiple directions. On such an exploratory album, highlight ""Mr. Broken Bird"" is where the band comes closest to delivering an anthemic pop tune. ""Too many rock stars, not enough gangsters,"" Friedlander sings, as a variety of synth sounds flutter, twitch, and burst with life beneath her propulsive live drums. The song feels a lot shorter than its nearly six-minute running time. Album closer ""Musica"" slows to a snail's pace as the band gradually shifts from textural subtlety to climactic guitar work, its loose structure making way for a stretch of improvisation that has grounding in both noise and psychedelic music. This 11-minute track, like most of the songs on Actually, finds a way to toe the line between the synthetic and the organic. Using the breadth of their musical language, La Big Vic manage to create a strand of experimental music that is as wide-spanning in feeling as it is in sound.","A cosmopolitan approach to making music yields kaleidoscopic results on this atmospheric dream-pop debut.

Timesup EP,Nguzunguzu,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02e5e6ef95969321f1e/1:1/w_160/4443cc44.jpg,2011-07-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15660-timesup-ep/,Fade to Mind,"Nguzunguzu's nervy approach to DJing and production is best exemplified by an edit of Monica and Brandy's ""The Boy Is Mine"" that appears on their Perfect Lullaby mix from the spring. They looped producer Darkchild's synth-harp intro from that 1998 hit and let it ride for about two minutes, turning it into a mediative electronic groove. The Los Angeles duo thrives on this type of sonic ""aha!"" moment, finding musical cues that expose the ways that mainstream rap and R&B aren't all that different from what's going on in the more explicitly experimental underground. Producers making footwork, Baltimore club, moombahton, post-dubstep, and more are toying with minimalism, repetition, and noise; but the urban music on the radio can similarly blow minds, and is often just as out-there. This isn't a new concept exactly (Timbaland at his peak was clearly an avant-pop genius), but Nguzunguzu are particularly skilled at bringing together disparate sounds-- as if their brains were missing the part that constructs binaries or identifies genre differences. They brought this to bear earlier this year when they stitched together M.I.A.'s demos and one-offs for Vicki Leekx, making something just as jagged as *///\Y/*, but way more more fun to hear. The only tangible divide in their work seems to be the conscious splitting up of how they approaching mixing and producing. While their mixes and live sets confidently bounce between genres with ease, their EPs (a self-titled one and Mirage from last year, and now, Timesup) have a different focus. Timesup's three songs and two remixes (by Kingdom and Total Freedom) don't deliver on the vibrant promise of Perfect Lullaby, but they aren't really supposed to do that. The fascinating and sometimes frustrating thing about this group is the unresolved tension between their wide-eyed, creative DJ mixes and their often insular original tracks. A good example here is ""Timesup"", which runs on an eerie, arpeggiated synth line, a cracking whip, and a baby cooing (homage to Timbaland's ""Are You That Somebody?"" beat, no doubt). In the middle, in lieu of dance breakdown, there is, for a few moments, a vocal sample from ""Let Me Get That"" by the awesome but unknown Baltimore club producer DJ Pierre, and right there is the Nguzunguzu recipe: mixing cutting-edge pop fighting with hyper-regional dance. ""Water Bass Power"" features a dark, menacing synth line that gets louder and louder before circling its melody, while vocal snippets, the ping! of a knife being unsheathed, and dub reggae noises clatter and stomp around. ""Wake Sleep"" slinks along like an Aaliyah single that never was, piling on increasingly avant-garde percussive noises (an opera sample, drips of water) and teasing the gorgeous hum of Art of Noise's ""Moments In Love"". It's difficult but rewarding stuff. A recent mix by the group for XLR8R however, features all of the music on Timesup and places it in conversation with the world of post-global dance at large. ""Wake Sleep"" talks to a sad-sack chipmunk soul remix of ""Moments in Love"" (Jodie's ""Moments in Heartbreak (LOL Boys Edit)""); the title track provides an extended intro for ""Everyday"", a Chicago juke jam from DJ Deeon; and a raucous Baltimore club-like track called ""Deep Inside Me Groove"" announces the arrival of ""Water Bass Power"". Because their mixes are so effective, it's tempting to think of Nguzunguzu's standalone releases as track-oriented DJ tools. But Timesup is living, breathing music that appears to be forming as it goes along. Here, strange sound effects and samples are stacked on top of each other, teasing total chaos but ultimately staying on track because of the foresight of two producers who know exactly what they're doing.","A new EP featuring three original tracks and two remixes from the production duo behind a number of eclectic and forward-thinking mixes.

Skying,The Horrors,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01db1335d7bf169a06f/1:1/w_160/e4e8d1e5.jpg,2011-07-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15645-skying/,XL,"It must be hard for a young British band growing up as NME darlings, but the Horrors seem to have handled it all rather well. They made the cover of the magazine in 2006 before having even released an EP, presumably on the strength of their black cotton-candy haircuts and their media connections. And they debuted first single ""Sheena Is a Parasite"" with an equally uncommon assist from director Chris Cunningham, who had previously done his unsettling, special effects heavy work for more musical outliers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. But if the Horrors' high profile debut was baffling, their follow-up moves were encouraging. They spoofed themselves with an appearance on an episode of the British comedy ""The Mighty Boosh"", as a band called the Black Tubes, in an episode revolving around protagonist Vince Noir trying to squeeze into a pair of impossibly skinny jeans so he can join the band. They quickly shed the campy, dark garage shocks of debut Strange House, announced a sophomore album produced by Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Cunningham (the latter resulting in a lot of ""cinematic"" talk despite his decidedly claustrophobic small-screen style), and started stretching out their sound to accommodate eight-minute krautrock jams. This is perhaps the best you can hope for from your rising rock stars: a willingness to laugh at oneself and a will to evolve. Skying continues the evolution set in motion 2009's Primary Colours, but with an emphasis on melody and pop form. This time, the band recorded and produced in their own studio, crafting a sound that recalls both the gothic pomp of 80s new wave and the big-screen dreaming of early-90s shoegaze, just as it was beginning to transform into chart-conquering Britpop. That the record can be heard as a catalogue of influences is nothing new for this outfit. They've routinely been tagged as ""record collector rock"" for their unabashed aping of influences from the Cramps to Can-- and indeed their well-selected covers indicate a group that has spent some time in record shops. Skying isn't likely to change that perception. The insistent chorus and Badwan's breathy delivery on ""I Can See Through You"" comes off like the Psychedelic Furs run through the effects rack of My Bloody Valentine. ""Monica Gems"" nods to Suede with its decadent guitar swirl and Badwan's moaning sighs. On ""Endless Blue"", a horn section pops in for the floating intro as if borrowed from a James Bond theme by way of Blur or ""This Is Hardcore"" before the song abruptly surges into an impressive rock nosedive. The debts owed here are obvious, but the taste is impeccable, and the application is more often than not convincing. There are moments when the band stretches out past seven minutes and opts for something more impressionistic, like the hypnotic ""Moving Further Away"" and the reclining-then-softly-erupting album closer ""Oceans Burning"", but the Horrors seem otherwise content to craft solid, emotionally inflected rock songs here. Lead single ""Still Life"" sets the tone in that regard, with an appealing bucolic stupor, rhythm section keeping half time, synths seeping backwards, and frontman Faris Badwan singing in a low, foggy voice that holds its spot high in the mix as easily as it drifts away on the chorus. That it brings to mind Simple Minds and, by extension, teen angst of the John Hughes variety, is by no means a negative. Both Badwan's voice and the band's production have made some strides here: He sounds surer behind the microphone than ever, and the band's guitars and synths are frequently smoothed of shrieks into one great blur, the black eyeliner watered down and smudged into a gray cloud. So while they may have started out as all glittering surfaces, the Horrors have evolved into a dependable band making wide-reaching rock music. Whether a calculated retreat or just a natural maturation, the Horrors have found a sound more content with background and atmosphere, and it suits them nicely.","The Horrors tone down the experiments of Primary Colours for a record with obvious stylistic debts and impeccable taste.

Family and Friends,Serengeti,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01513d197565213a3d2/1:1/w_160/4dfca7c5.jpg,2011-07-21 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/,Anticon,"As L.A.-based Anticon has expanded its horizons, it has slowly moved away from the navel-gazing, leftfield hip-hop that made its name. Chicago rapper David Cohn, who performs as Serengeti, represents something of a return for the label. Following a 2009 collaborative record with producer and fellow Illinois native Polyphonic, Serengeti's first solo album for Anticon is an unflinching homage to an indie-rap template that has otherwise largely gone the way of the dodo. Producing Family and Friends are enigmatic WHY? frontman Yoni Wolf and ex-Casiotone for the Painfully Alone mastermind Owen Ashworth (now working as Advance Base), who provide a sparse but sometimes gripping backdrop for Cohn's stable of strange characters-- all down, a few out-- and their struggles. As an MC, Cohn is part broken rambler, part highly attuned people-watcher. He sounds like he could use a drink, but his easy, near-spoken-word delivery is nothing if not welcoming. If you're up for hearing about absentee junkie fathers or suburban malaise, Cohn has a barstool ready for you. For such a conversational rapper, though, Cohn often makes it difficult to know exactly where you've landed in the conversation. Tracks like the free-associative ""A.R.P."", which finds the narrator taking DMT and later stubbing his toe, or the cryptic ""Ha-Ha"", about falling in love with the girl at the hardware store, would benefit from a bit more coherence. And even when lucid, Cohn frequently has trouble living up to the cleverness of his own concepts. For every moment as arresting as UFC-fighter lament ""The Whip"", which pairs Cohn's workmanlike flow with spirit-crushing toy keyboard plinks, there are too many where the pieces fit awkwardly. The desperate ""PMDD"" pines hazily for a girl in a pharmaceutical ad, while the depressive title track echoes the famous ""Choose Life"" speech from Trainspotting, but both make their points a little clumsily. Fortunately, Wolf and Ashworth each prove to be positive enablers, adding nuanced touches when things get a bit too ham-fisted. Base's chunky ""Ha-Ha"" could pass for a minimalist tUnE-yArDs track; Ashworth's soulful, lonely ""Dwight"" features carousel music piped in from the ends of the earth. Not quite stylistic opposites but still distinctly different, the two producers almost always make sure to stay on the same page, taking skeletal percussive tracks and shocking them with little flecks of light. But as with much of Family and Friends, that light seems to be just out of reach.","Produced by WHY's Yoni Wolf and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone's Owen Ashworth, the Chicago MC's solo Anticon debut marks a return of sorts for the label.

First Edition,Fruit Tree Foundation,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff9b1335d7bf169a034/1:1/w_160/6743713e.jpg,2011-07-21 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15613-first-edition/,Chemikal Underground,"So what we have here is the Scottish indie version of ""We're All in the Same Gang"", a gathering of artists playing against type for a good cause. Originally an entrant in last year's Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival, First Edition put its roster up to the task of exploring appropriate lyrical themes. Where N.W.A and Ice-T once took on violence, here James Graham (the Twilight Sad), Emma Pollock (the Delgados), Rod Jones (Idlewild), and Scott Hutchison (Frightened Rabbit) come together to promote mental health. Good cause and intentions aside, there's an irony to this bunch working on such a project. The Delgados crafted their masterpiece in large part by living up to its title of Hate, two of Idlewild's biggest hits are ""Little Discourage"" and ""Live in a Hiding Place"", while Frightened Rabbit had to go ahead and put a song on their last record called ""Not Miserable"" because there's no way you'd assume the opposite was the case unless clearly notified. Fruit Tree Foundation is rounded out by relatively obscure (at least in the U.S.) singer-songwriter types like Alasdair Roberts, Jill O'Sullivan, and Jenny Reeve. And for the most part, the songs here gravitate more toward their low-key and affable folkiness than the highwire bloodletting of the aforementioned. Recorded in a mere five days, these are largely acoustic and almost entirely off-the-cuff, showing their moving parts in an almost aggressive way: A good number of songs here begin with in-studio chatter (somewhat stilted back-and-forth about Glasgow and such), push through verses and choruses over static riffs and chord changes like they're in the progress of being written, and wander off into noodly guitar solos. Undoubtedly, First Edition was a fun project to record and I'm sure a welcome relief for most of those involved to sidestep the heft and expectations associated with their day jobs of supervising emotional powder kegs. But while there's chemistry, there's little in the way of spark, and First Edition's good intentions add up to a record that doesn't do anything upsetting. And as such, it just feels like a misuse of resources. If nothing else, it's proof enough that these guys are masters of technique and timbre as vocalists, rather than just ones with a weapons-grade emotional arsenal. Graham's richly burnished low register in particular sounds fantastic simmering over acoustic dirges completely free of feedback, yet it's worrisome that without the guitar squall and tortured, punishing lyrics, the Twilight Sad could conceivably veer toward the maudlin tearjerkers of the Swell Season. Likewise, Pollock's contributions to co-ed bashers like ""Singing For Strangers"" recast her as a chipper cheerleader, a weirdly deferential step down from her wearied but wise counterpoint to Alun Woodward. The Graham feature ""Favourite Son"" puts lumbering drums right up in the mix like the Twilight Sad, and ""I Forgot the Fall"" retains Hutchison's unmistakably plaintive melodicism, but both lack a crucial element of catharsis. Within First Edition's context, Jones' ""All Gone But One"" is the hookiest and most forceful of the power-pop entries. Were it an Idlewild song, and it certainly could be, it would simply be a standard issue cut from one of their later LPs which found them getting less bookish and yet somehow also less edgy. Maybe my expectations are skewed, but in a situation such as this-- basically, a planned vacation from having to front such lyrically self-flagellating outfits-- you might figure it'd be embraced as on opportunity to take more chances both sonically and thematically. It's a nice enough listen and surely you'll come out of the purchase feeling much better about yourself (which is pretty much never the outcome upon listening to anything these guys have put their name on in the past). But ultimately, even the most rip-roaring of the bunch simply sounding like low-stakes versions of what we've grown accustomed to.","Members of the Twilight Sad, Frightened Rabbit, the Delgados, and Idlewild come together for a one-off album united by a common theme.

"To What Strange Place: The Music of the Ottoman-American Diaspora, 1916-1929",Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b005ea9e61561daa655b/1:1/w_160/2a0a49d1.jpg,2011-07-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15624-to-what-strange-place-the-music-of-the-ottoman-american-diaspora-1916-1929/,Tompkins Square,"In the summer of 1952, the filmmaker, collector, and noted weirdo Harry Smith-- then just 29-- squirreled himself away in a two-room office at 111 West 47th Street, chewing peyote buttons and digging through his massive collection of hard-sought 78rpm records, selecting the songs that would later comprise Folkways' Anthology of American Folk Music. Over the past half-century, the Anthology has become a neatly packaged stand-in for the whole of American folk music, despite its dubious legality (rights were finally cleared for the 1997 reissue) and hugely personal conception. The blues, country, and folk songs (most recorded in the 1920s and 30s) Smith chose to include range from the obscure (Uncle Eck Dunford) to the popular (the Carter Family), and are presented with an eye toward the metaphysical-- the so-called Celestial Monochord etched onto its cover is being tuned, after all, by the Hand of God. The Anthology is a stunning thing, disorienting and funny and sad and transcendent, but it's also limited by design; the collection's supposed snapshot of the American folk canon is as much a self-portrait as anything else. Now, over a half-century later, To What Strange Place-- a 3xCD box set compiled by another 78 collector, Ian Nagoski-- feels like a long-lost companion piece. Rather than defining folk music as a rural, indigent practice, Nagoski goes broader, offering up the Ottoman immigrant songs that animated American cities in the first half of the 20th century for inclusion in the same canon. To What Strange Place collects the work of musicians from Anatolia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Levant who lived in the U.S. and recorded in New York City between World War I and the Depression (1916-1929), as culled from Nagoski's own collection (according to a recent Washington Post profile, he purchased most of the source records en masse, for $5, from some dudes paid to haul junk out of vacated row houses). None are sung exclusively in English, and nearly all nod to musical traditions likely unfamiliar to casual listeners. It's not particularly easy to absorb, at least at first-- the textures and instrumentation are foreign, the tempos are shifty, the voices often spastic. Ultimately, though, none of that matters: The immigrant experience, so rich with glee and terror and homesickness and hope, is expressed here in all its wild, universal glory, and if you listen hard enough, these songs start to sound as familiar-- and as American-- as ""This Land Is Your Land"". The jewel of the set is Marika Papagika, a Greek immigrant and famed practitioner of Rebetiko (a Greek analogue of Ottoman café music) who apparently recorded over 225 records in the 1920s and eventually helmed her own club, Marika's, in New York. Nagoski included some of her work on his 2007 set Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Musics 1918-1955, but she gets more space here, and she deserves it: Papagika's voice is bold and otherworldly, a high, skewering whine that defies rote comparison. It feels desperate and pre-verbal, like a baby crying in the middle of the night, and with it Papagika communicates (un-self-consciously, and with unchecked fervor) a staggering range of emotion. ""Smyrneiko Minore"" is her best, strangest track; there's not much melody, just Papagika howling over piano and a bit of bowed strings (probably a violin), but the anguish in her voice is unforgettable. Elsewhere, it's the rawness of the performances that lingers. Tetos Demetriades' rendition of ""Miserlou""-- which Dick Dale transformed into an instrumental surf-rock staple in 1962-- is dark and ominous; Kanuni Garbis's ""Ouchak Canto Guzel Tourna"" is frantic and foreboding. There are expressions of joy here, too-- D. Perperian's ""Tamzara"" (a folk dance) is giddy and bright, an invitation to move. With its many moods, To What Strange Place offers a small, telling glimpse of the immigrant existence, using only the songs they recorded here. It feels as essential to an understanding of American music as anything else.","This 3xCD box set compiled by 78 collector Ian Nagoski chronicles the experience of Ottoman immigrants in the early 20th century.

Bermuda Drain,Prurient,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0249d034d5c69bf4815/1:1/w_160/016f0bbc.jpg,2011-07-21 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/,Hydra Head,"This is not the plug-your-ears Prurient you've come to know and possibly love. In the world of 21st-century harsh noise, Dominick Fernow's one-man recordings have been among the harshest, the most physical, the least compromising. Earlier albums, like 2006's hellishly screeching Pleasure Ground, were overwhelming floods of feedback and heavy psychic ugliness. Like the earliest industrial music, Prurient's records were more than sonically off-putting. They felt pained, beyond urgent, the product of some need to loose inner turmoil into the world, coming as much from Fernow's body as his machines. Bermuda Ground isn't just pleasant by contrast with Prurient's old unholy racket. It's often actively enjoyable, albeit in a decidedly creepy way, rooted as much in familiar retro-rock moves as formless face-eating noise. Perhaps it's down to Fernow's time playing in the decidedly more accessible and anthemic synth-pop/post-punk act Cold Cave, but Bermuda Drain is full of distortion-free keyboard, perverse disco beats, moments of beauty, even hooks. Especially for those who feel they get enough aural abuse just walking down city streets, it's the first Prurient record they might throw on for reasons other than testing their pain threshold. Which isn't to say it's accessible, necessarily. It may owe more to the creeping dread of old synthesized horror flick scores than the splatterpunk intensity of exploitation gorefests, but Bermuda Drain still opens with the kind of scream and fried-circuit blast designed to clear the room of everyone but the hardcore. When he's not roaring like a metal frontman let loose on a rave tune (""A Meal Can Be Made""), Fernow's whispering in a way that feels intimate in a decidedly uncomfortable and icky way. And song titles like ""Let's Make a Slave"" should let you know that Fernow-the-songwriter isn't exactly penning happy-go-lucky new wave here. Fernow's shrieking and quiet-loner monologues also give Bermuda Drain a real sicko intensity that's been lacking from the recent glut of ""dark"" early-1980s synth stuff. He has the sound down, somewhere between Factory Records sturm-und-drag and grotty old VHS-tape slasher soundtracks, but you could never accuse Bermuda Drain of being a slick or faceless attempt at mere nostalgia. Like the earlier Prurient records, it comes from a dark and personal place, less an exercise than an explusion. Fernow wants to shake you up, unnerve you, make you understand just how fragile ""beautiful"" music is, rather than simply make sure he gets the synth tones period-perfect.","Dominick Fernow's latest one-man recording is... pleasant, and not only by contrast with his old unholy racket.

Section.80,Kendrick Lamar,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b026b1335d7bf169a080/1:1/w_160/2d538998.jpg,2011-07-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/,Top Dawg,"Kendrick Lamar is a weird kid, and rap music could always use more weird kids. The 24-year-old is a Compton native with a budding and mysterious Dr. Dre connection, but there's little-to-no link to his hometown's gangsta-funk legacy in his music. Instead, Lamar is very much a product of the late blog-rap era-- an introverted loner type who's willing to talk tough but is more interested in taking a Mag-Lite to his own personal failings and what he sees as the flaws of his generation. His rap style is fluid and melodic but approachable, and his frantic tumble of syllables evokes the feeling when you're high enough that your thoughts arrive fast and interrupt each other. If one of the Bone Thugs guys had a dorky, overly sincere younger cousin who was really into Afrobeat and Terrence Malick movies, it'd be Kendrick. Lamar does exist within a strong West Coast continuum, but it has nothing to do with Dre. Instead, he's very much within the tradition of 90s groups like Souls of Mischief or the Pharcyde-- self-deprecating and insanely talented kids who routinely ripped dizzy, slip-sliding flows over mellow jazz breaks. Section.80, Lamar's new album, arrives on a wave of blog-based buzz, but beyond a couple of ill-advised choruses, it doesn't make much attempt to present Lamar to major-label A&Rs or to a wider audience. Instead, it gives him a chance to chase his muse wherever it runs. The production, mostly from relative unknowns like THC and Sounwave, is almost uniformly excellent-- a spaced-out blur of astral horns and blissed-out Fender Rhodes, with drums that only knock when they need to. A couple of guys from Lamar's Black Hippy crew-- those guys really sound like Souls of Mischief when they get together-- show up, but the album isn't a guest-heavy affair. It's a young thinker attempting to describe the world as he sees it. ""You know why we crack babies cuz we born in the 80s,"" Lamar raps on the excellently emo relationship-song ""A.D.H.D."", and that's a theme that comes up over and over. Everywhere he looks, Lamar sees generational symptoms of the kids who came from the era of crack and Ronald Reagan. When he looks around, Lamar sees self-hate, nihilism, institutionalized oppression. When he talks to girls, he sometimes recalls the supportively sincere Goodie Mob of ""Beautiful Skin"", actually counseling against cosmetics on ""No Make-Up (Her Vice)"": ""Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?/ From heaven is where you got it from."" (Somehow, the redundant double-""from"" makes the sentiment all the more adorable.) And he also recognizes self-destructive tendencies in himself: ""I used to wanna see the penitentiary way after elementary/ Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me."" But it's not like he's some preacher/prophet figure; he says ""suck my dick"" often enough that it gets boring. Given that Lamar is a talented and earnest young man with a lot to say and no big label nudging his music toward accessibility, it's only natural that he'd lose his way every once in a while. Section.80 is an hour long, and it could drop probably a quarter of its running time without anyone missing anything. And certain moments just make me wince so hard, like this one, from ""Hol' Up"": ""I wrote this record while 30,000 feet in the air/ Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair/ If I could fuck her in front of all these passengers/ They'd probably think I'm a terrorist."" Those few lines add up to a repellent cauldron of horniness, persecution-complex fantasies, exhibitionism, and plain old youthful Bad Idea Jeans indulgence. Dre hasn't yet taught Lamar how to hone all his best ideas into a few absolutely killer pieces of music; maybe he still will. But self-serious flaws and all, Section.80 still stands as a powerful document of a tremendously promising young guy figuring out his voice. Its best moments (""Rigamortis"", ""HiiiPower"", ""Kush & Corinthians"", ""A.D.H.D."") are simply dope as fuck, no qualifiers necessary.","The Compton-based, Dr. Dre-affiliated rapper steps out with a pop-rap debut that puts a futuristic spin on 90s alt-rap.

It's a neatly evocative trick, but one that gloomy post-punk icons like X, the Mekons, and the Birthday Party already pulled off in the late 1970s and early 80s. Another quarter-century removed from greasers, torch singers, and murder balladeers, Sons and Daughters' resurrections had a tendency to feel like kitsch, but really fun kitsch. Their antiquated influences eliminated the need for reverence, so the band could concentrate on cranking out absurdly enjoyable slices of breakneck nastiness. Sons and Daughters' third full-length, Mirror Mirror, mostly trades one brand of pillaging for a duller one. The moroseness and death obsession remain (one song's about the Black Dahlia), but instead of using dark concerns as a springboard for sick thrills, Sons and Daughters have gotten hung up on the precise craft of emulating gothic post-punks like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. Mirror Mirror is impressively spot-on in its reenactments, from doomy synths and cavernous drums to guitars that are practically always whirring, grinding, or shooting out lonely shards and tendrils; in fact, much of the album's merit is textural. But that's a dispiriting realization considering how great Sons and Daughters have previously been at crafting arresting, immediate hooks. And what happened to the tempos? Even the band's most ardent supporters would concede their previous albums were a tad relentless in their barreling pace, but too much of Mirror Mirror is either plodding or static. Only a few times, most notably on ""Breaking Fun"" and ""Rose Red"", do Sons and Daughters really get pulses pounding. All this atmosphere and portent would be fine if the band displayed the presence to sell it. Instead, engrossing lead singer Adele Bethel cedes too much of the mic to counterpart Scott Paterson, who has been effective in call-and-response settings but isn't distinctive enough to carry songs himself. No matter who's taking the lead, neither singer seems to be having much fun, which used to be a constant for Sons and Daughters regardless of how bleak or blood-soaked their lyrical fixations might have been. Mirror Mirror smacks of a band struggling to be taken more seriously, but simply settling on a more stone-faced form of pastiche isn't the way to do it. All they've really done is trade a Halloween party for a history lesson.","The Glasgow band's macabre spirit remains on its third LP, which recalls gothic post-punks like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus.

Sam Baker's Album,Samiyam,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0285e6ef95969321f15/1:1/w_160/7c4f0d82.jpg,2011-07-20 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15655-sam-bakers-album/,Brainfeeder,"This year, producers like Clams Casino, Araabmuzik, DJ Burn One, and Main Attraktionz' Squadda B have been turning out amorphous beats that sound just as good (and especially in Clams' case, better) without someone spitting over them. The music they're making is beguilingly strange, and although much of it carries bits and pieces of J Dilla's legacy, most sounds far removed from his dusty knock. Dilla set a precedent for the producer-as-auteur movement, but his influence is less apparent in the twisted synths and borrowed trance figures of this year's most interesting beatmakers. Of course, there are still plenty of people carrying Jay Dee's torch in 2011: a good deal of the soul stable in Stones Throw, for example (J-Rocc, Oh No, Dilla's spiritual cousin and fellow innovator Madlib), as well as California's Sam Baker, aka Samiyam. His second long-player, Sam Baker's Album, is being released by Brainfeeder, Flying Lotus' label-- another artist whose early work was heavily indebted to Dilla (though creatively, he's in a much different place now). Compared to the futurist glitch work that's been released on Brainfeeder as of late, Sam Baker's Album sounds quite formalist in execution, right down to the last delayed beat-drop. Still, this isn't exactly a ""real instrumental hip-hop, naw'mean"" traditionalism. Tart, whinnying keyboards abound, as well as a fair share of oozing bloops. But there's an enticing familiarity to what Samiyam is doing here, even if its own tiny eccentricities and abstractions take a few listens to wholly unpack. The stoner-giggle vocal samples scattered throughout only accentuate the record's sticky, loping feel; needless to say, there's a certain smoky atmosphere this music was almost tailor-made for. When he leaves the arena of sampled hip-hop signifiers and heads toward more abstract pastures, however, the material loses itself in its own towel-under-the-door haze. Baker's early EPs (especially his 2008 Return EP for Hyperdub) were smothered with melodic wooze, which made the relatively straightforward boom-bap snippets on that same year's Rap Beats, Vol. 1 LP seem a little rote and old-head by comparison. Sam Baker's Album continues on the latter path, but with a little more attention paid to the use of empty space. In other words, it's ""Sam Baker's album"" by name and ownership, but it's also another beat tape in a very crowded field, one where it's easy to get lost amidst the increasingly innovative producers working now.","The young producer with some promising EPs under his belt steps out with a full-length on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint.

FRKWYS Vol. 7,"Borden, Ferraro, Godin, Halo & Lopatin",by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b027b1335d7bf169a083/1:1/w_160/acd3fe27.jpg,2011-07-20 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15654-frkwys-vol-7/,Rvng Intl.,"The concept for RVNG's FRKWYS series-- meetings between young experimental musicians and veterans-- is nothing revolutionary, but so far the results have been quite rich for one-off collaborations. That trend continues with Vol. 7, for which the label first approached Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never. Together they brainstormed a project involving minimalist composer David Borden. The latter's résumé is wide-- even including a mostly-unused score for The Exorcist-- but he's best known for founding the synth ensemble Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company. That group began in 1969 playing Moog versions of pieces by Terry Riley, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich. Soon they began composing their own music and experimenting with newer electronics, something they continue to do today. Such openness to sounds and ideas comes through on the five pieces here, which are impressively varied despite being pretty uncomplicated. Part of that variety is due to the participants Lopatin brought into this session last August-- James Ferraro, Laurel Halo, and Samuel Godin, all open creative minds on their own. But what's most impressive about Vol. 7 is how it never sounds like a mess of piled up activity, or five voices elbowing for room. If someone told you this was made by one person, you'd probably believe them. So it's not too far-fetched to guess that, for two days in the studio, these five became of one mind, joined by a simple sonic vision. Perhaps Borden is just that forceful a musical personality, steering his comrades toward a very distinct set of goals. However these tracks came together, the unity of purpose is evident throughout. It starts from the very first seconds of opener ""People of the Wind Pt. 1"", a 12-minute drone that constantly builds and expands, marrying airy etherealness to dense guts in a way that recalls Stars of the Lid's best epics. From there, the ensemble winds through a range of moods and timbres. ""Internet Gospel Pt. 1"" warps like an underwater wedding processional; ""People of the Wind Pt. 2"" adds a sense of galactic transmission to Pt. 1; and ""Twilight Pacific"" fuses Lopatin's flowing repetitions to Borden's Terry Riley-ish all-night-flight inclinations. All of this can get pretty spacey and drifting; you'll need some predilection for things like OPN, Emeralds, or the early Kranky roster to fully dig into such synthed-out pieces. Stick with it, though, and you'll get rewarded by closer ""Just a Little Pollution"", whose rippling synths and haunting Julee Cruise-like vocals-- presumably provided by Halo-- make it a kind of otherworldly pop song. It's as if these sonic sculptors spent the previous five tracks chiseling away at a big block of sound until it produced this shiny little gem. It's remarkable enough that this one-time alliance produced so much good improvised music, an approach so dependent on listening and communication that it can take years of trial and error to create the right working situation. But the fact that they also made that music build to an album-ending peak gives Vol. 7 a shot at being a record that holds up over time, regardless of how impermanent this group itself may be.","The latest in the RVNG's series of improv collabs between experimental music veterans and their contemporary counterparts includes minimalist David Borden.

Writings on the Wall II,Gucci Mane,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b022ea9e61561daa658e/1:1/w_160/b0062cf2.jpg,2011-07-20 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15649-writings-on-the-wall-ii/,Datpiff.com1017 Brick Squad,"Gucci Mane has lowered expectations considerably in the past year. In addition to the rapper's recidivism issues and garish facial tattoos, his Brick Squad guest spots have been as inspiring as a game-six LeBron James performance. But by almost any standard, Writings on the Wall II is a major comeback. There are no weak tracks or unfortunate production choices, and Gucci's delivery, if not his lyrical content, retains its distinctive character. Musically, he's adapted his unique songwriting approach to a more aggro era, welcoming Brick Squad mixtape mercenaries Lex Luger and Southside to the fold. The new sonic strategy works as quick sleight of hand to distract from what could otherwise be some repetitive moments on a 70-minute rap record. It helps that the ever-versatile Drumma Boy produces the bulk of the record's back end. Drumma's highlight here, ""Translation"", ratchets up tension with simple, ascending piano lines, a trick the producer has used before. Few beatmakers can create a larger variance of ideas and moods with such minor modifications of a simple formula. (It may be no coincidence that Gucci's lyrical approach functions in a similar manner). His beat for 50 Cent feature ""Recently"" throws out the rulebook completely. A walking bass line transforms into a mind-warping rumble during the chorus, while an organ riff hits at unpredictable rhythmic angles, giving the entire song a frenetic tension. Southside takes some unexpected liberties, too, most impressively on ""Major"", where lightly tapped snare and exhaled background vocals create an odd sense of ominous delicacy. Fat Boy's ""Camera Ready"", the tape's standout, bears more similarity to recent Brick Squad tracks like producer Prince's epic ""Like a Dream"" than the typical Fat Boy sound (""Wasted""). Lyrically, Gucci is considerably more generic now than during his memorable 2008-2009 run. Even when his flow hits its double-time stride, he's still falling back on trap-rap clichés. Missing are the moments of narrative power, like his verses on ""Frowney Face""; gone is the must-rewind imagery that used to dominate his tapes. Gucci acknowledges on ""Gucci Talk"" that he has returned to the ""no pad, no pencil"" style of his earlier work. But when 2008's No Pad No Pencil came out, everything Gucci was releasing seemed to push hip-hop's possibilities in new directions. Writings on the Wall II instead consolidates several song structures he has done before, wedding them to some (stunning) contemporary production. Gucci's lyrics weren't celebrated for their complexity, although he deployed that strategy on occasion. His lyrics' power stemmed from the imagery and humor he used to render in full color a world that for most rappers exists only in black and white. To the tape's considerable credit, Gucci disappoints here only when compared with himself.","The Atlanta rapper's latest mixtape adapts his unique approach to a more aggro era by tapping Brick Squad mixtape mercenaries Lex Luger and Southside.

Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? [25th Anniversary Edition],Megadeth,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b029b1335d7bf169a086/1:1/w_160/62974cb0.jpg,2011-07-20 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15656-peace-sells-but-whos-buying-25th-anniversary-edition/,Capitol,"Like many bands in the 1980s metal underground, Megadeth were hugely successful while still essentially operating under pop's radar. Their abrasiveness, speed, gross-out extremity, and nasty humor essentially barred them from the airwaves in the days when people called Slippery When Wet a metal album with a straight face. Like their indie-label peers who'd come up out of hardcore, Megadeth built an audience by touring relentlessly, and when they were finally signed to a major, they became even more popular. And yet if you're reading this, you're under 30, and you don't consider yourself a metal fan, you might not know their music at all. This is a sad thing. For the class of '86, a year that gave us Megadeth's Peace Sells and Metallica's Master of Puppets and Slayer's Reign in Blood, the refusal to go the Poison/Cinderella route was both a point of pride and what forever kept them cult acts. (Discounting Metallica, who conquered the world only to become a joke.) They were absolutely huge cult acts-- festival draws and elder statesmen still listened to by millions-- but cult acts nevertheless. So this reissue of Peace Sells, celebrating a quarter century of Megadeth's second but first truly great album, is probably more a sop to those diehards than anything else, but if it turns one curious party into a convert then it's worth it, even in this time of bald cash-grab reissue ugliness. And there are many reasons why this album might still appeal to fence-sitters and folks turned off by extreme metal's very extremity. Peace Sells is a dead serious record that never takes itself too seriously, a slab of political shock commentary that's loaded with black comedy, and which treats Satan and ICBMs with the same awe because they're both great villains. Like most literate metalheads of his era, Megadeth leader Dave Mustaine was deeply spooked by the supposedly imminent threat of mutually assured destruction, a day-to-day possibility that those born after the cessation of Cold War hostilities might not understand. He was also plenty pissed over the non-nuclear atrocities of the Reagan years, along with the kind of bleak, man-against-the-universe shit that transcends presidential terms. But Mustaine also understood he was working in an idiom that invariably turned the most serious material, from eschatology to existential despair, into thrilling, fist-pumping, head-banging Grand Guignol. He believed in peace but knew thrash metal wasn't particularly suited to depicting some hugs-and-kisses utopia. Nuclear war was as shit-your-pants real as fears got in 1986, but it also made for some great exploitation-flick imagery. And while the lyrics to ""Devil's Island"" make their point about death row being a sad end for any human being, the music makes state-sponsored execution sound suspiciously awesome. Megadeth had plenty of the grimy intensity of the cassette-trading bands that would give birth to death metal and all that followed, but they'd absorbed enough radio hard rock to not abjure things like memorable thuggish riffs, big shout-along triumphant choruses, and a rhythm section that could actually throw down on a groove without succumbing to the metal vice of momentum-killing displays of virtuosity. The bass hook that opens ""Peace Sells"" is so instantly memorable that everyone who watched MTV in the late 80s and early 90s knows it even if they think they don't. This is a thrash record of course, and so there are solos galore, with Mustaine deep in the throes of technical ecstasy. But while drummer Gar Samuelson is no slouch in the chops department and songs shift tempos in seconds and plenty open with those noodly sturm-und-drang intros that made 80s metal so portentously great, the pummeling pace rarely lets up. ""Good Mourning/Black Friday"" takes a few minutes to rev up, but then it's like everything great about hardcore, plus a dose of the kind of show-off skill that makes lesser musicians' fingers bleed. There's a drunken laugh-so-you-don't-cry attitude on Peace Sells that seemingly owes as much to Flipper as to Ozzy, especially on the title track, but that doesn't mean Mustaine was mocking his audience. Megadeth were always a metal band first and foremost, which meant never condescending to anyone for feeling helpless and hopeless, or for thinking death and destruction were simultaneously kinda cool and really not-cool. Like most metal heroes, Mustaine on Peace Sells identified deeply with the dead-end kids who bought his records, even if he could play better than 95% of them. The raw live set appended as a bonus disc to this reissue-- there's also a multi-disc version that features many different mixes of the original album that will probably be of interest strictly to those who've been living with it for years-- features a snarling and ferociously funny performance of ""Peace Sells"" that outdoes the album version in everything but fidelity. It's an all-time ode to feeling disenfranchised but at least knowing you can still write an epic screw-you song about that fact. Mustaine knew there was no point to making this stuff sound like a drag. Because if you did manage to survive another day, there was always another beer and another awesome metal record waiting for you, and sometimes that was enough.","Circa 1986 was a very good time for metal, and Megadeth's awesome entry from that year has been given an expanded reissue.

Staring Into the Sun,Olivia Wyatt,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01413d197565213a3cd/1:1/w_160/4a0b9dd1.jpg,2011-07-19 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15636-staring-into-the-sun/,Sublime Frequencies,"In 2009, filmmaker/photographer Olivia Wyatt traveled to Ethiopia to document a music and dance event called the Festival of 1000 Stars. Things didn't quite go according to plan. On her arrival in the country, Wyatt discovered the Ethiopian government had canceled the event. So Wyatt instead headed out to visit 13 tribes, whose performances Staring Into the Sun documents in a DVD, a CD, notes, and photographs. It's an extraordinarily careful, comprehensive package, featuring stories about close calls with authorities, comments on the distinctive qualities of each tribe, and details about the various instruments used in the recordings. The hour-long DVD is the best way most of us will have to witness the music of the people Wyatt visited. With visuals as hypnotic as the performances, she deftly illustrates how music seeps into many different parts of life. The opening scene is one of the most spectacular, showing members of the Borana tribe in southern Ethiopia chanting a cyclical polyphonic song as they pass up buckets of water from a multi-level well; Wyatt's shots skillfully match the repetitive nature of this backbreaking work. Scenes of spiritual possession and ceremonial whipping further demonstrate music's role in ritual practices. The sheer breadth of styles in the film also extends to more commercial fare-- often featuring keyboards and synthesized drums-- shot directly from TV sets. One clip even features a band decked out in military garb and posing with guns. That stands in stark contrast to the the scenes of the Tsemay tribe, where kids and adults bounce around in a circle to an uplifting song. The big highlight here is the discordant synchronized panpipe playing of the Dirashe tribe in the Great Rift Valley; the music feels like it could career out of control at any moment, but it never does. The accompanying CD is less essential than the film, though it just about works as a standalone item. Listing no artists or tracks, the disc is simply a collection of recordings Wyatt made. Some of them feature the trilling female vocals that are a staple of the region; others are built around an open-ended structure of loosely handclapped rhythms. The masterfully off-kilter panpipe players of the Dirashe tribe resurface in a nearly eight-minute excerpt of a piece that presumably stretched on far longer. The disc's common thread comes through its ceaselessly looping vocal chants, which are mesmerizingly easy to get lost in-- just as the performers themselves may have done to reach such a trance-inducing state. Staring Into the Sun shows how that kind of loosening is simply one of many purposes music can have for a group of people.","In a DVD, a CD, notes, and photographs, the filmmaker/photographer documents the music of 13 Ethiopian tribes with extraordinary thoroughness.

The London trio has been stepping out, remixing others and working on collaborations. During an appearance at the Independent Label Market in London a couple of months ago, Lewis Rainsbury cut a slight, red-haired figure, complete with a ""Vondelpark"" badge for identification. Capitalization quirks aside, nyc stuff and nyc bags is mostly a clearer vision, too. Sauna's smeared sonics have given way to something more refined. On ""TV"", Vondelpark even pushes the vocal more to the center, though it's still bathed in warmly romantic production. With synth strings and a vocal that has a bit of R&B drama, ""Camels"" is similarly sensual, as guitar chords stab at the fringes of languid bass and a clipped garage sample. Vondelpark's production still feels happily self-contained, but the smaller details-- thin bongo rhythms, a jagged sample hit in the right channel-- help make for a more focused track. Where Sauna put elements of UK garage and bass music in a bedroom setting, nyc stuff and nyc bags is a more confident, summer-drenched listen. Take ""Feat B"", for instance: a Balearic-leaning cut complete with dubby horns, bongos, and a blissed-out female vocal. Anyone missing Air France could do worse than find comfort food here. While this second effort shows no great leap forward in terms of quality, it only underscores that Vondelpark are one of the more interesting UK production groups to emerge lately, mysterious or not.","The second EP from this once-mysterious London trio is more refined than last year's Sauna, with elements of Balearic, R&B, and UK garage.

Pearls & Embarrassments: 2000-2010,Siriusmo,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b021ea9e61561daa658c/1:1/w_160/e7fe2609.jpg,2011-07-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15648-pearls-embarrassments-2000-2010/,Monkeytown,"However you divvy up the spectrum of electronic dance music, Siriusmo is an outlier. A Berlin producer with a penchant for French-sounding electro-house, he infrequently performs live, even though his slick touch on the keyboard is a big part of his appeal. Ambivalent about scenes, he released singles on many different imprints before finally showing, on 2011's Mosaik, that he could work beautifully on a larger canvas. Issued by similarly genre-averse dance duo Modeselektor on their Monkeytown label, this career-spanning 2xCD compilation finds Siriusmo cleaning out his closet. It turns out that the ratio of pearls to embarrassments is impressively favorable. Many of these 42 tracks are available in digital form for the first time, and eight of them, such as the Vitalic-style grinder ""Hello DJ"", are previously unreleased. Covering the first decade of the 2000s, the set bears ample French-touch traces, often evoking a more musical Mr. Oizo, an earthier Daft Punk, or a much airier Justice. Siriusmo's remixes and compilation appearances for Ed Banger and Kitsuné Maison make this Parisian connection as close as he comes to a scene affiliation. Still, the hot-blooded, jammy aesthetic here is more like a bundle of personal predilections than a membership application. Siriusmo loves to set scampering funk, meaty saw-wave synths, and hammy vocal samples against percussion so crisply pounding it edges into rock territory. Clean-cut verses and choruses, connected by extended, unlooped instrumental solos, enhance the live feel-- the electric guitar on ""Last Dear"", for instance. Some of the sample choices loaded into Siriusmo's Korg Trident lean toward pop, such as a brief Stevie Wonder/Jackson 5 horn flourish on ""All the Girls"". Others are more obscure: Early electronic pop pioneers Perrey-Kingsley supply the protoplasm for ""Blaue Sonne"". At nearly two-and-a-half hours, Pearls & Embarrassments is a lot to take in, and the reliability of Siriusmo's craft causes the songs to run together after a while. But that's just the nature of this sort of housecleaning. You really can dip into the compilation at any point and find something appealing. Siriusmo works in essentials: Key in on the effective groove and the stirring harmonic idea, and jettison the rest. In a way, he's a throwback to a time before limitless soft synths gave producers limitless choices. ""Sometimes,"" he told one interviewer, ""it's good just to have your one synthesizer or one piano and your drum and you can play like you're in a little band.""","This career-spanning compilation finds the genre-averse Berlin electronic producer revealing an impressively favorable ratio of pearls to embarrassments.

Seven Stars,Fennesz,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0235e6ef95969321f0c/1:1/w_160/50f675a0.jpg,2011-07-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15650-seven-stars/,Touch,"It's weird to think of a Christian Fennesz record as ""comfort food,"" but that's what living with an experimental artist's work will do. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Austrian avant-guitarist and corrupted software whiz trafficked in the harsh and unpredictable ""glitch"" sound of his benefactors at the Mego label. But as he began to play openly with the surf's-up sound of 60s pop on 2001's Endless Summer, listeners not usually into grating improvised noise began to find a way into Fennesz's world. He became one of the 21st century's more improbable crossover figures, and one of its most inventive advocates for bringing the guitar into a brave new laptop world. Fennesz's music hasn't shied away from darker places since, but his love of twisted beauty allows people a chance to become familiar with, even soothed by, a sound that seems decidedly not-for-everyone on the surface. A four-track EP, Seven Stars is Fennesz in an almost purely placid mode, not too dissimilar to what he was exploring a decade ago. The least comfortable moments here, like ""July"", aren't all that different from the dark ambient the Aphex Twin was exploring circa SAW II. Even the metallic buzz that rises like the sound of insects on a summer night stays on just the right side of being shrill. Tracks like ""July"" and the cinematic ""Shift"" are about as uncomfortable as music can get while remaining immersive rather than alienating. The last few years have seen a glut of day-at-the-beach acts using digital tools to capture a sense of summertime fun. Aside from the fact that he arguably got there first with Endless Summer, Fennesz's music is never quite so glib or obvious, attempting to capture the vibe of bands like the Beach Boys without the aid of quotes, hooks, harmonies, or even the stable ground of pop song structure. On ""Liminal"" and the title track, he evokes the heartsick string arrangements of the Pet Sounds era with unnatural swells of computerized sound that nonetheless have a real low-key emotional punch. And while his guitar is both bright and sad, a pure 60s balladeer tone, his playing still follows an improviser's inscrutable logic. Seven Stars is a welcome if not surprising dose of what Fennesz has been doing well for a decade now, playing on the thin edge between familiar pleasures and the truly out-there.","This brief four-track EP finds Christian Fennesz in lyrical mode, using his processed guitar to evoke a memory-washed vision of pop.

When Fish Ride Bicycles,The Cool Kids,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00aea9e61561daa6569/1:1/w_160/23c089f9.jpg,2011-07-19 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15628-when-fish-ride-bicycles/,Green Label Sound,"Back when the Cool Kids first made the rounds a few years ago, it was still pretty weird-- revolutionary, even-- for a new group to build a buzz and an audience without relying on a physical product. The Chicago retro-rap duo seemed like they sprang fully formed from the Internet. They lived their lives one blog-bait mp3 at a time, releasing another dose of icy-cool 808 thud whenever the time felt right. For this group, the idea of an actual full-length album was almost beside the point. If they could tour-- and play lucrative corporate-sponsored shows-- without the benefit of an album, then why bother? It wasn't like the Cool Kids were bursting with artistic ambition; they rapped about their sneakers and cars and haircuts, not exactly the sort of thing that extends well over an hour or so. And though they've been promising the imminent arrival of honest-to-god debut album When Fish Ride Bicycles for a few years now, the release remained stuck between record labels, and it felt perfectly reasonable to assume that it would never show up. The album has now shown up, but it's not some sweeping cohesive statement. Fish has a few big names attached, but it's not an onslaught of guests. If you've been paying attention to these guys over the past few years, almost everything here will sound familiar. The production, mostly from Cool Kid Chuck Inglish, is straightforwardly spacey, a crisp and bright take on minimal mid-1980s drum-machine boom. Inglish and Mikey Rocks have voices so flat that they usually sound bored, and they're less interested in punchlines than they are in matter-of-fact situational boasts, many of which have a weird patina of nostalgia to them. When Fish Ride Bicycles is out on Mountain Dew's Green Label Sound imprint, but it's not like the Cool Kids are rapping about sipping on Code Red or anything. Instead, the album illustrates the absurd things a rap group has to do to release an actual wide-circulation retail album in 2011. They've made the leap to corporate patronage with their personalities totally unchanged; the move hasn't audibly affected their personality as a group. (It does have to be said, however, that the gigantic Mountain Dew logo on their cover art is a pretty bad look.) The real move that the group makes on When Fish Ride Bicycles is a slight step away from minimal 80s rap toward squelchy 1980s funk. Most of the tracks here come with gooey Zapp-sounding keyboards, a slick melodic sound that gives their tracks an extra dimension. It's a sound that works for them in small doses, but when they go back to it a bit too often, the trick robs their simple, affectless sound of some of its power. Melody and warmth aren't Chuck Inglish's strong suits; he sounds best when he's stripped his tracks back to their barest elements, as he did on The Bake Sale EP. But these flourishes are nowhere near enough to drown the album. The Cool Kids' greatest asset is that their music is fun; it sounds good at parties, or on summer-afternoon drives, or at corporate-sponsored live shows. That doesn't change with When Fish Ride Bicycles. These guys still know who they are, and their lines still show some serious linguistic style without going out of their way to impress: ""She wanted me to beg, but I beg your pardon/ I'm Park Place, you're Marvin Gardens"". For a couple of tracks, they link up with the Neptunes, the producers whose dizzy Triton experiments probably showed them what a resourceful mind can do with a drum machine. Ghostface Killah and Bun B roll through, sounding grizzled and authoritative, their mere presence implying a sort of legitimacy. Asher Roth pops up on the unnecessary posse cut ""Roll Call"", but he gets out of the way without doing any serious damage. The whole thing makes for a solid, low-impact listen. It's not going to change your life or even, most likely, your day. But it might make 39 minutes pass by more quickly, and that's all it seems to want to do. The Cool Kids have now proven that they can make an album, but they haven't proven that they ever needed to make an album.","The Chicago retro-rap duo has been promising the imminent arrival of a proper debut album for so long it felt reasonable to assume it would never show up.

Mindreading,Singer,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00c13d197565213a3bf/1:1/w_160/20a86518.jpg,2011-07-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15631-mindreading/,Drag City,"It's best not to go looking for an explanation as to why Singer have taken so long to follow their 2008 debut, Unhistories. Or what the impenetrable front and back covers mean, or why the song titles appear only on a loose sheet of paper tucked inside the album sleeve. The liner notes indicate the Chicago art-rockers recorded Mindreading in April 2009, with mixing later that year by Randall Dunn-- a producer for heavy-music heavyweights Sunn O))) and Earth. Meanwhile, with former U.S. Maple guitarist Todd Rittman leaving to focus on his Dead Rider project, Singer have slimmed down to a three-piece: ex-U.S. Maple drummer Adam Vida; his brother, Ben; and former 90 Day Men bassist Robert A.A. Lowe (who also records solo as Lichens). Beyond that, their new album's as mysterious as Lowe's brief collaboration with TV on the Radio. The air of inscrutability surrounding this band helps align Mindreading with some pre-internet Drag City releases. It's reminiscent of something you'd stumble across in the racks of a record store and take a chance on, perhaps because of the label or a familiar name credited on the back sleeve. Even the enigmatic covert art might be enough. The musical offerings inside continue that theme; it's never really clear who's singing, what the words are, or which instruments were used. The sighing falsettos that rise and fall against stuttery percussion and chunky analog keyboard runs on opener ""Sister's Mane"" will be familiar to anyone who remembers Unhistories, but there the similarities mostly end. Guitars are on the backburner for much of this recording, with condensed synth tones pushed firmly to the fore. ""Voices from the Tapes"" flicks back and forth between a serene central groove and great piles of ugly electronics. On the following ""Wi(s)tches"", the group's vocals battle with analog sounds that reach a piercing screech as the song dawdles to a close. There are germs of good ideas here: For instance, the woozy, multi-layered singing in ""Dial ""M"" for Mother"" edges close to the kind of work Doseone occasionally hits on in Subtle. Too often, though, Singer are on a journey with no particular destination in mind, especially when they lurch from the ugly liquid funk of ""Gabbing"" into the unfocused crooning of closer ""Bitter'd Moon"". It's a shame, because the track records of everyone involved suggest Mindreading could have been a different proposition. Instead it's all untethered strands of work loosely floating around, with occasional moments of clarity that might make this a record worth returning to when another three years have passed.","Featuring former members of 90 Day Men and U.S. Maple, the Chicago band retains an air of inscrutability on its second Drag City album.

Hello Cruel World,Sole and the Skyrider Band,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01e13d197565213a3eb/1:1/w_160/928fda6d.jpg,2011-07-18 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15647-hello-cruel-world/,Fake Four,"Back in the early half of the last decade, when Anticon was more of an abstract-rap collective and less of an experimental indie pop label, Sole was arguably the crew's most intriguing figure-- a self-lacerating prophet figure who jumbled the personal and the political into a blur of half-formed conceptual syllable-spray. He rapped so fast that you actually needed the lyric sheet he'd helpfully include in his albums, and those lyrics would be so dense and jangled that you'd also need the little mini-essays he'd pen about each song and its inspirations. Self-seriousness was his thing, and it could sometimes be a weakness; it's a big part of the reason he came out on the losing end of a terrifically entertaining beef with El-P (El: ""I feel like Selena, the president of my fan club trying to kill me""). But that intensity also turned him into a compelling figure. ""The white man's the fucking devil,"" he almost-famously roared in 2003. And yes, he's white. Obviously. But the twisty, blown-out form of indie rap that helped birth Sole (and El-P, and everyone else in that scene at that time) has largely disappeared from the map, sending an entire generation of underground rappers scrambling to figure out ways to remain relevant. On his new Hello Cruel World, Sole tries harder than most. As he has on most of his recent releases, Sole teams up with Arizona's multi-instrumentalist trio the Skyrider Band. But together, they chase a different sound this time out: the sort of diffuse synthetic soul that's slowly taking over the rap mainstream. The beats on Hello Cruel World are full of simple, understated new-wave melodies and empty space. Sole has largely curbed his frantic, out-of-control, sometimes-arrhythmic rap style, going for a measured and controlled thing instead. There are song where Sole sings. There are songs were Sole sings through Auto-Tune. At times, he sounds like a dreadlocked, anarchist-bookstore version of Drake. It's a truly odd album-- and in its own way, it's a brave one. ""Bad Captain Swag"" is the best song here, and the one that best encapsulates the sound Sole chases all throughout the album. I'm not even really sure what ""Bad Captain Swag"" is about-- credit card debt or something. But with its truly unexpected Lil B guest verse, the song works as a summit meeting between two very different generations of indie rap, and it shows that the two rappers may have as much uniting them as they do separating them. These are two messy artists, and both verses have their goofy moments. The Based God is in his spaced-out, the-world-is-crazy mode. Sole, meanwhile, offers up this as a boast: ""You don't wanna battle me; you're better off enlisting in the upcoming war against China."" (He also becomes maybe the first rapper to ever use the word ""stagflation"" in a rhyme.) And yet there's a sort of outsider-art chemistry at work here, with the weirdly catchy zoned-out synth track and the airily crooned hook from Denver electro-noise producer Pictureplane. It's nuts-- and not in a bad way-- that Sole and Soulja Boy are now just one degree removed from each other. Nothing else on the album touches that track, but it's intriguing to hear Sole push his old style in different directions. Hello Cruel World is an album that flirts with accessibility, but you're not exactly going to crash radio playlists with lines like this bit of anti-Red Cross invective, from ""We Will Not Be Moved"": ""Want me to donate? We gave helicopters to Israel, free health care to the Middle East. Now who's gonna fix my teeth?"" And things get downright silly when he leaves behind politics entirely and indulges in dorm-room philosophizing: ""Someday I'll leave this place, be it by bullet or by rocket/ And they can use my corpse to fertilize another planet"" (from the title track). But nobody's ever going to this guy for clear, concrete ideas; abstract obfuscation is what he does. On Hello Cruel World, he finds some new ways to do it. They don't work out as often as we might hope, but at least he's trying.","On his latest LP, Sole collaborates with Lil B and Pictureplane and rhymes over diffuse synthetic soul from the Skyrider Band.

Nightdolls with Hairspray / On Air,James Ferraro,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01a9d034d5c69bf4800/1:1/w_160/13f4b44c.jpeg,2011-07-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15643-nightdolls-with-hairspray-on-air/,Olde English Spelling Bee,"Two years ago, David Keenan of The Wire coined the name ""hypnagogic pop"" for a strain of lo-fi, 1980s-centric psychedelia, or ""pop music refracted through the memory of a memory."" Though Ariel Pink's AM-radio concoctions made him a godfather, Keenan placed James Ferraro-- previously known as part of the noise duo Skaters-- at the center of this ""movement."" In Keenan's article, Ferraro's first quote went like this: ""I've always viewed my music as just sort of plugging into a matrix of human-alien culture, through plugging into a world broadcast of media entities that jump out of the screen and merge with life via people internalizing them as soundtracks for life temples."" Ferraro's music can be as confusing as that rambling proclamation. Yet there's a weird, hermetic kind of logic to both. Whatever a ""life temple"" might be, you can imagine it when you hear his mysterious, hyper-referential sound. He relies on samples, loops, and the textures and aura of 80s pop-- the kind heard on worn-out VHS tapes and glitchy video games. And he turns cheesy clichés-- preset keyboard melodies, phasey riffs, falsetto choruses-- into something hypnotic and almost cyber-spiritual, like a photocopy blurred by generations of reproduction until it becomes a Magic Eye painting. Often, this approach can produce remarkably catchy music. Night Dolls with Hairspray in particular is filled with hooky gems. Its plunging bass lines, warped guitar riffs, and crooning vocals bounce around the stereo space like lasers in a hall of mirrors. Listening feels like peeking into the mind of a pop-culture-addled 80s teen-- an effect enhanced by lyrics about adolescent concerns sung in a pre-pubescent whine. Hissy, muffled, and oddly funny, Night Dolls can get pretty dizzying. Some might even find its sheen nauseating, much the way audiences left The Blair Witch Project more sick from the shaky camerawork than scared by the plot. But for anyone enchanted by Ariel Pink, there's lots to love in Ferraro's murky pop. Just don't wait around for him to tone it down. More often, in the massive discography he's built, he turns the queasiness up to 11. In the resulting swamps of noise, ghosts of pop songs, movie soundtracks, TV ads, and other fleeting ephemera stew and rumble, but never quite break through the stubborn surface of his dense mix. That's the mode that Ferraro is in on On Air, first issued as a limited CD-R on Olde English Spelling Bee and recently pressed onto vinyl by Underwater Peoples. Here, he seems to man a black-hole radio station, mixing in surreal announcements and static-laden transitions. Snippets of melody and blasts of noise slam into each other, with single tracks often containing four or five chunks of what could be songs on their own. Maybe Ferraro's own trippy titles explain it best: ""Electrocuted Hair"", ""New Waver From Hawaii Saturn"", ""Virtual Sumo Bubble Gum"", ""Cyber Shock Headtroplolis"". Those could all be the names of Boredoms outtakes, and On Air's arty mess recalls that group as well as Yamantaka Eye's even nuttier Hanatarash. Much the way that listening to a lot of Boredoms can alter your perception of what music is and how it works, making it through On Air is a bit of a brain-altering experience. By the end of it, you might understand Ferraro's Wire quote a little better, whether or not you can explain why. Plugging in, jumping out, merging with life-- on paper they sound like discarded New Age platitudes, but in the hands of James Ferraro, those ideas regain the electric charge of epiphany.","Hypnogogic pop maven explores his mysterious, hyper-referential 1980s sound on a new album and a recent vinyl reissue.

Thee Physical,Pictureplane,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0115e6ef95969321ef2/1:1/w_160/cbc9180a.jpg,2011-07-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15635-thee-physical/,Lovepump United,"The hands-across-the-void cover art that accompanies the proper sophomore effort from blasted-electro producer and Denver scene magnate Travis Egedy's Pictureplane project, Thee Physical, brings to mind a few things: fictional Spinal Tap album Smell the Glove, the ""kid who found the severed hand"" statue in ""Arrested Development"", and Magic Eye artwork with all the eye-straining already in place. In reality, the image ties into the album's loose themes of human touch and technological eroticism. This dorm-room theorizing also shows up in selected song titles: ""Trancegender"", ""Post Physical"", ""Body Mod"". Listeners who approach Thee Physical probably aren't showing up for Egedy's flimsy personal-political philosophizing, though. They're here for his frayed, ear-bleeding take on 1990s diva-house and electro-- disembodied leather hands be damned. Pictureplane's 2009 label debut, Dark Rift, was a statement of purpose, packed with both thrilling moments (""Goth Star"") and drifting provocation (nine-minute closer ""True Ruin""). On Thee Physical, the approach is considerably more refined, with HEALTH's Jupiter Keyes helping lend a new, immediate sonic appeal. Keyes knows a thing or two about tempering industrial-tinged aggression with sugared sensuality (see last year's HEALTH single ""USA Girls""), and on Thee Physical that balance is more present than it's ever been in his main gig. Further contributing to the album's accessibility is Egedy's move from staticky speaker-pounders toward honest-to-god pop songs. Early album offerings ""Real Is a Feeling"" and ""Post Physical"" ably showcase his steps toward electro approachability; other songs feature Egedy engaging as an in-the-flesh sideman to the snippets of throaty vocal samples strewn throughout. This man-machine relationship was prominent on Dark Rift, too; Thee Physical does it better. What's more, Egedy's inherently thin voice sounds stronger in its surroundings here. And yet, for all the improvements, there are times when Egedy's handmade beats seem slightly out of rhythm with everything else that's going on around them (an issue that's especially apparent on ""Black Nails""). And when the album's most vibrant hook shows up, on ""Trancegender"", it's quickly buried in favor of the murky atmospherics that jam up the album's second half. Thee Physical wants to mosh in the punk club as much as it wants to throw on some lip gloss and hit the town, and it's frustratingly enticing to imagine how the record would have turned out if Egedy had leaned on the gas towards the latter option.","With help from HEALTH's Jupiter Keyes, Denver producer Travis Egedy refines the blasted-electro approach of 2009's Dark Rift.

Leave Home,The Men,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00bb1335d7bf169a053/1:1/w_160/87b2d352.jpg,2011-07-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15629-leave-home/,Sacred Bones,"Nothing is sacred to the Men. For one, this Brooklyn quartet's name is pretty much identical to that of fellow New Yorker JD Samson's active post-Le Tigre project, MEN. Their 2010 sophomore release, Immaculada, featured a caterwauling noise-punk thrasher called ""Oh Yoko"" that had absolutely nothing to do with the classic John Lennon song, or Ms. Ono herself, for that matter. Their new album swipes its title from a legendary record by New York's most famous punk band, the Ramones. And part way through the obliquely titled mid-album track ""( )"", when the band realize they're ripping off the fuzz-bomb riff to Spacemen 3's ""Revolution"", they just go ahead and swipe a line from the song too, and cap it with another quote from Spacemen's ""Take Me to the Other Side"" for good measure. And yet: For all the cheeky references and inside jokes at play on the Men's Leave Home, you'd be hard-pressed to find a purer, no-bullshit, serious-as-a-heart-attack rock record released this year. Listening to Leave Home feels a lot like living inside of Michael Azerrad's 1980s indie-rock tome Our Band Could Be Your Life, variously bringing to mind Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr.'s SST stints, Sub Pop-vintage Mudhoney, and Touch and Go-era Butthole Surfers (who surely would approve of a song title like ""Shittin' With the Shah""). Tellingly, Azerrad's book ties up its narratives the moment its subjects signed to majors-- partly because, technically speaking, they ceased to be indie rock at that point but, more importantly, because those artists produced their most enduring, groundbreaking music while recording for independent labels. Leave Home is likewise a frozen tableau of that tipping point, imagining a parallel universe in which your favorite first-wave indie-rock bands never had to sign on corporate letterhead, never got anywhere near MTV, never toned down their act, and never got old-- they just kept on blowing minds at the peak of their powers in perpetuity. Where the discographies of those aforementioned influences can more or less be plotted on a straight line from chaos to control, the Men's modest catalogue thus far presents no such linear evolutionary trajectory. Immaculada may have introduced folky acoustic guitar passages and extended doom-metal instrumentals to their post-hardcore attack, but rather than continue to explore those stylistic detours, Leave Home sees the Men return to the full-torque distorto-rock of their 2009 debut EP, but blow it up on a grander scale with a more intense batch of songs. And rather than try to upgrade the fidelity to accommodate the more epic execution, the unapologetic corrosiveness of the sound is ultimately what gives it its power and heft. So that means Leave Home's boldest gesture-- the seven-minute opener ""If You Leave...""-- is also its least typical, not just for its tsunami-sized shoegaze haze, but for its open-hearted candor, as its lone, repeated lyric (""I would die"") provides a surprisingly affecting answer to the title's open-ended suggestion. The song is every bit as surprising coming from these guys as the similarly miasmic ""Farewell"" was on Boris' 2006 album Pink, showcasing the respective bands' abilities to be as blissful as they are bludgeoning. But where ""Farewell"" anticipated the Japanese doom demigods' eventual drift toward melodic accessibility, ""If You Leave..."" is a calm-before-the-storm misdirection. By the time Leave Home's side one winds down with the grueling, hoarse-throat howls and torturous, slow-motion squall of ""L.A.D.O.C.H."", you'll be wondering if you're still listening to the same band. But on Leave Home's second half, the Men's dual affinities for brute punk-rock force and bad-trip psychedelia fuse together to brilliant effect, with a searing series of songs that refuse to relent even as they encroach on the five-minute mark-- in particular, the storming ""Bataille"" suggests Sonic Youth's ""Hey Joni"" as recorded by Funhouse-era Stooges, while the closing ""Night Landing"" effectively blurs the line between krautrock and punk in fine Neu! '75-style. Of course, with a name like the Men-- and reference points like these-- it's all too fitting that this album will undoubtedly appeal to a certain subset of record-collecting dudes. But the Men's treatment of their well-curated influences is less akin to that of fan-boys playing in a tribute act and a lot more like an irreverent hip-hop producer's approach to breaks-- key in on your sources' coolest moments, change the context, and ride that perfect sound forever.","On their latest album, Brooklyn's Men put their own spin on the raw and ragged sound of noisy 1980s indie rock to delirious effect.

Wayward Fire,The Chain Gang of 1974,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01c9d034d5c69bf4804/1:1/w_160/b75849c8.jpg,2011-07-14 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15644-wayward-fire/,Modern Art,"The Chain Gang of 1974 is the kind of band name that is so obviously apropos of nothing that it pretty much begs to be met head-on. So let's just get some painfully obvious housekeeping out of the way: Kamtin Mohager's glossy synth-pop project sounds absolutely nothing like a chain gang and even less like 1974. Instead, the album stresses familiarity, easy nostalgia, and an eagerness to please, laying down its dividing lines like the ""80s Night"" at your local undergrad bar: If you can somehow find novelty in that sort of thing in 2011, you'll have yourself a blast, whereas anyone who thinks the decade had more to offer than doing tequila shots to ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" while Pretty in Pink plays in closed captioning are gonna feel like killjoys through no real fault of their own. I'll give Mohager this: The dude knows how to write a hook. The arc of the melodies, the word choice, the decision of when to crank the reverb and when to lay off-- all are indicative of someone who's broken down the hits of his childhood into formulae, their moving parts charted and graphed. Nearly every track on Wayward Fire makes some sort of ascendant grab at a brass ring, and displaying a skill that's often underrated, Mohager can string together fairly basic rhymes in a way that gives just enough meaning. And he can lose himself in whatever guise is appropriate to get his point across. ""I get so high when the devil comes to take me/ I get so high when the devil is a lady,"" is delivered by an agitated disco infiltrator, while a New Romantic on the verge of emotional overload promises, ""I will run, I will fly, I will see you in a matter of time."" That sort of thing. Problem is, there's a lot of Wayward Fire that takes place between those choruses. More to the point, there's a lot of Wayward Fire period: at nearly an hour long, it surpasses audacity into the realm of pure self-defeat. There are pleasures to be had here, but every single track could comfortably shave about a minute and a half and still deliver them. It's less of an issue when he's courting bedside melodrama as opposed to dancefloor seduction since Mohager sounds more comfortable navigating verse/chorus structure than a vamp. And when he tries dance music, his idle hands mostly get the better of him. Wayward Fire continually misses a sweet spot between being lean and dirty enough to aerodynamically groove and being maximalist to the point where it opts out of that mode completely. And as a result, there's always that one last addition to the mix that sticks in your craw. I suppose that it's a sign of where we're at, that an LP so steeped in 80s signifiers feels so completely... normal. But while certainly dedicated to its source material, Mohager's lack of commitment to any sonic or lyrical identity unintentionally confirms the old stereotypes that kept this stuff out of indie rock in the first place-- that it can't be made personal and that its ultimate goal is to be fashionable and disposable. Though clearly precocious with melodies, Mohager never presents himself as more than collector, which is why Wayward Fire ends up less like a living celebration of the past and more like a display case of your favorite synth-pop action figures in their original packaging.","The band name suggests throwback pop, but the era in question is actually the 1980s, and Chain Gang of 1974's emulation of it is both impressive and its undoing.

With no guest singers and zero hooks, Ratcliffe's new solo EP is another chance for these one-time house barbarians to remind people why their unconventional spirit once made dance classicists turn up their noses. Dorus Rijkers unleashes live-sounding rhythms that twist, turn, and feel like they don't want to do what their producer tells them to do. Opener ""Tightrope"" sounds like Ratcliffe tried to lay down a fat, funky, straightforward breakbeat, but then his cheekiness got the better of him, with the boom-bap quickly mutating into a loony jazz-metal hybrid. On much of the EP, the squealing synths and ultra-bright electro riffs aren't too far off from the kind of arcade-game mania and tortured g-funk beloved by Zomby, Rustie, and their peers. In fact, the frenetic, densely layered ""Mindset"" makes the post-dubstep crew sound almost staid, while its fried fuzz-bass and general noisy mayhem shame the Ed Banger crew and similarly brutal French house producers. The second half of the EP is calmer, but just as surprising. ""Flying by the Sun"" essentially applies the methodology of disco edits to an old electric jazz record, compressing a half-hour of free-flowing improvisation into a deranged four-and-a-half-minute jukebox single. But even in shortened form, this kind of knotty jazz-funk isn't for everyone. Neither is Dorus Rijkers as a whole, even at just four tracks, which is probably the perfect length to avoid burning out on music this dense and convoluted. If you think that Basement Jaxx have been too buttoned up lately, then you'll probably appreciate the way Dorus Rijkers sounds like a man unleashing a lot of fuck-you intensity. Throw it on looking for the glossy roller-boogie bounce or Euro-pop sheen of Crazy Itch Radio or Scars, though, and the drums alone will slap the expectations right out of you.","Basement Jaxx half Simon Ratcliffe's new solo EP is another reminder why the house duo's unconventional spirit once made dance classicists turn up their noses.

The Baltimore-based noise-punk quartet embraces the signature sounds of the alternative nation, but uses pedals, loops, and off-kilter rhythms to pummel its teenage heroes into blurry abstraction. Borrowing from punk-funk and nu-metal as much as spazz-core and pigfuck, the group plays Dr. Moreau with a decade's worth of MTV buzz clips. It's telling that Dope Body's debut album, Nupping, has a song called ""The Shape of Grunge to Come."" Bro-rock and Boredoms mash up better than you might think. Live, Dope Body are a mosh-worthy mess of sweat and blast beats. Frontman Andrew Laumann alternates between punker grunts and animalistic yelps, his shirt rarely staying on his chest for an entire performance, while guitarist Zach Utz makes hairpin turns between stoner chugging and modem noise. Nupping does an admirable job of capturing the band's spastic onstage energy. Album opener ""Enemy Outta Me"" wiggles to life with the band playing around an off-time loop, but it quickly makes a left turn into scorching riff-rock. Utz pulls double duty, answering each of his chugging stoner riffs with a bevy of electronic gurgles. When it's time for the big guitar solo, he instead opts for some balloon-on-hair squelches. ""Bangers & Yos"" pogos around on a rubber-band riff that's just far enough removed from ""Bulls on Parade"" that Rage's lawyers won't have grounds to sue. Like Philly sludge-punkers Pissed Jeans, Dope Body have a special gift for draining the air from muscle-head music. Pissed Jeans do this mainly through lyrics, imbuing early 80s hardcore with a narrative of manly anguish. Dope Body pull at the sounds of dude-rock like taffy-- tugging guitars out of key, building up big walls of heavy rhythm only to belch in the face of fist-pumping catharsis. Utz's expansive pedal board and glitchy deconstruction of Tom Morello riffs may hint at arty pretensions, but Dope Body still smell punk.","The Baltimore-based noise-punk quartet uses pedals, loops, and off-kilter rhythms to pummel its teenage heroes into blurry abstraction on its debut album.

Red Hot + Rio 2,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01813d197565213a3dc/1:1/w_160/840e1ae3.jpg,2011-07-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15642-red-hot-rio-2/,E1,"The Red Hot Organization was founded in 1989 with a noble if idiosyncratic mission: to fight AIDS through pop culture. At the time, the general public was just beginning to understand what AIDS actually was and how it could be transmitted. Red Hot's decision to raise money for AIDS research by selling themed albums featuring prominent musicians helped raise awareness as well as funds, and its first compilation, 1990's Red Hot + Blue, featuring David Byrne and Tom Waits, among others, covering Cole Porter songs, sold more than a million copies and made millions of dollars for AIDS-focused non-profits. Twenty-one years later, Red Hot + Rio 2 is the 12th Red Hot title, and the organization has released nine other compilations (including No Alternative and Dark Was the Night). The math is a little different these days. Not as many people buy CDs, and the idea of selling a million of these seems almost quaint (2009's Dark Was the Night still managed to raise more than a million dollars, though). AIDS awareness is also in a very different place-- in an odd way, people in the United States seem to have almost forgotten how bad the pandemic really is, and how crushing it is in a lot of societies, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has become something that's just there, in the background, and we may know a few people who have it, but the aura of public health crisis has fallen away from it in our media. So in that way, building awareness is just as important as ever. Red Hot + Rio 2 is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot + Rio installment, which was focused on an update of 60s bossa nova sounds. This moves on to a contemporary take on Tropicália, and the list of collaborators involved includes a few original Tropicálistas: Rita Lee (solo), Os Mutantes (with of Montreal), Tom Zé (with Javelin), and Caetano Veloso (solo and with David Byrne). It also features Beck and Brazilian singer Seu Jorge doing a version of the former's own ""Tropicália"", and a mix of other artists doing covers of original Tropicália songs and new tunes written in descended styles. These artists, working alone and together in various combinations, come from at least four continents, and you'll hear Brazilians singing in English, Americans singing in Portuguese, and all sorts of other oddities. Sonically, this is aimed in a strange place, somewhere near the middle of the road, but not quite there-- it edges into too-smooth territory on the John Legend and Twin Danger tracks, but also into funky surrealism on the Os Mutantes/Of Montreal update of ""Bat Macumba"" and into heady jazz on Madlib's collaboration with veteran Brazilian singer Joyce Moreno. Some of the best tracks either feature Tropicálistas or their songs. Gilberto Gil's classic ""Aquele Abraço"" gets a propulsive, percussion-heavy funk reworking courtesy of Forró in the Dark, Brazilian Girls and Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo. David Byrne and Caetano Veloso sound great dueting on ""Dreamworld/Marco De Canaveses"", backed by spooky synths and strings. Veloso's simple ""Terra"" also sounds good getting picked apart by Prefuse 73 and remade as it plays from a spare acoustic song into a gently dissonant orchestral work. In 2011, the mainstream benefit LP no doubt plays a delicate balancing act, trying to be interesting enough musically to connect with adventurous listeners, but broadly appealing enough not to drive off more casual listeners who want to contribute to a good cause while buying one of the very few CDs they'll purchase all year. There's a sweet spot in between that Red Hot + Rio 2 comes close to hitting over the course of its two discs. Some of it will be a little too out-there for some people, and some of it will be a little too harmless for others. But overall, it's an interesting assemblage of artists, and the music is good, covering just enough ground that you can feel the variety but no one's likely to be overwhelmed.","The 12th volume in the series dedicated to AIDS awareness features Madlib, David Byrne, Tom Zé, Of Montreal, and more collaborating on Tropicália updates.

I'm Gay (I'm Happy),Lil B,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b017c0084474cd0c1baf/1:1/w_160/cef586f4.jpg,2011-07-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15641-im-gay-im-happy/,BasedWorld,"It's possible not even Lil B knows how much music he's released in the past four years. Spend 15 minutes trying to sort out how much he's made in the past four months and you'll feel in your stomach just how deep the Internet goes. More than any other musician, the Bay Area rapper has adapted his creative behavior to resemble the rippling action of your RSS feed-- an unceasing, pellet-dispenser flow of new content. It's a self-contained musical universe, located at the vanishing point on the ""all-or-nothing"" spectrum, and its cult of faithful has been steadily building to the point where the mainstream rap industry has been forced to contend with him. The result was a hip-hop comedy of manners: as XXL included him on their Freshmen 2011 list alongside industry non-entities like Mac Miller and Lil Twist and Lupe Fiasco publicly congratulated himself for ""getting it,"" B basically continued whistling his tune, collaborating with Lil Wayne and Jean Grae and Tony Yayo and rapping over How to Dress Well instrumentals. And then he announced at Coachella he was going to name his next album I'm Gay. With this single statement, Lil B calmly detonated a flower-power land mine in the center of what is arguably rap's most tortured, combustible political arena. Whatever his motivations (it probably had something to do with his philosophy of universal acceptance and self-love, but his manifestos don't survive close analysis), he guaranteed that the album's audience would be exponentially larger than anything he'd done before. I'm Gay appeared on iTunes last week, and by convenience or design, it's his most coherent, cohesive, and accessible single release to date. His followers may debate whether Rain in England or 6 Kiss or Illusions of Grandeur or Bitch Mob: Respect Da Bitch is better (Lil B has a flair for titles), but for the uninitiated, I'm Gay does a great job of articulating his ethos and appeal in the space of one album. If you're intrigued by Lil B but shrink from the commitment of keeping pace with a human data stream, it might be the only record you'll ever need. That's not to say that I'm Gay contains all of Lil B's personae. The album finds him securely in his dazed, child-like observer mode, where he peers at the world as if for the first time and wonders aloud. He has many other faces-- occasional boom-bap traditionalist, tweaker of boom-bap traditionalism, uncomfortably personal YouTube diarist-- but this side is easily B's most relatable and endearing. The production, by frequent collaborators Clams Casino, 9th Wonder, and others, reinforces the mood of naive reverie: ""Gon Be Okay"" samples an orchestral flourish from the soundtrack to Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, while ""Unchain Me"" is built on a loop of ""Cry Little Sister"" from The Lost Boys soundtrack. ""I Hate Myself"" is a woozy, pitched-down loop of Goo Goo Doll's ""Iris"" in which the drums hit like down pillows. You're unlikely to find a more guileless or gentle hip-hop record this year. Lil B's stream-of-consciousness lyrical approach remains uniquely suited to this sort of cosmic contemplation. Composing your thoughts on the fly has obvious downsides, and Lil B's YouTube channel is littered with examples of times he hit ""record"" and the muse failed to follow. But here, he's consistently focused and has a knack for articulating universal sentiments in seemingly artless wording: I can't think of anyone else who could say things like, ""The people die for a piece of paper, it's so stupid"" or ""If God's real, then why'd my friend have to die?"" or ""Don't wanna go to school because the teacher's too simple/ I just wanna know where I come from, just tell me,"" and prompt contemplation instead of laughs. But then, reproducing lines like these in print doesn't do them justice. Lil B's music draws on spontaneity as its wellspring; you hear him stumble, pause for breath, abandon a line of thought and start over. So when he happens across a searing image like ""Mental slavery/ Niggas hangin off trees in the woods,"" and roams his way to ""I'm nicer than Grandma with a cup of iced tea"" a few lines later, there's a charge of discovery in the air-- the conviction that you're hearing music and expression being born raw. ""I'm ready to give up/My old thoughts...Everything I seen was a lie/I'm not ready to die/I love myself"" he declares on ""I Hate Myself,"" a vague but powerful manifesto that suggests why Lil B has inspired such fervent devotion. He projects fearlessness, which can take many forms: it can mean deciding to name your rap album ""I'm Gay"" out of thin air. (The subtitled ""I'm Happy"" was a deflating backward step, it's true, but it was hard to get riled considering how little motivation he had to choose the name I'm Gay in the first place). It can also mean posting the album for free to your quarter-million Twitter followers hours after it was made available for purchase. It can mean sharing every half-baked scrap and warty throwaway you record, trusting your fans to decide what's worth keeping. So while I'm Gay isn't a definitive statement, it is an especially compelling point on a bizarre trajectory, one that feels worth keeping around.","The hyper-prolific rapper with an endless number of YouTube freestyles finds a new focus and crafts his most accessible album.

Invasion of the Mysteron Killer Sounds,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0079d034d5c69bf47e1/1:1/w_160/d5ddb363.jpg,2011-07-13 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15630-invasion-of-the-mysteron-killer-sounds/,Soul Jazz,"Kevin ""The Bug"" Martin has been a strong advocate for Jamaican music over the past 20 years in his work as both artist and curator. But it's his adventurousness that makes him so valuable. Beginning with the Macro Dub Infection compilations he put together for Virgin in the 1990s, Martin has been just as interested in the way Jamaican pop has been reinterpreted, mutated, and even perverted by outside influence as he is with tracking its history at home. Martin assembled this year's Invasion of the Mysteron Killer Sounds with Stuart Baker, the head of Soul Jazz, a UK label that is itself a longtime champion of Jamaican sound system culture. The two discs work as a whistle-stop tour of post-digital Jamaican music, but they also highlight the ways dancehall has spread around the globe, twisting itself into almost unrecognizable shapes along the way. Built largely around instrumentals, Mysteron jumps from Jamaican dons cranking out essentialist beats to U.S. producers like Diplo making tracks for a wired worldwide audience. While the minimalism of some tracks might test the patience of those who aren't already beat freaks, Martin and Baker's selection is a perfect way to learn about the outlandish, shouldn't-be-this-funky things Jamaican producers (and their far-flung acolytes) have been doing to rhythm for almost three decades now. With its delirious beat clonking from one headphone to another, Andre ""Suku"" Gray's ""Sign Rhythm"" sounds both tribal and cybernetic, and you can marvel at the way Gray has made these super-heavy drums dance around the mix. The ""Sign Rhythm"" also has a hook that sounds like a tea kettle's whistle or a broken kazoo, which is a pretty good indicator of how far-out Jamaican producers will go in search of texture. Firehouse Crew's ""No False Hair"" has a sprinkle of familiar Caribbean steel drums, but good luck hearing them fighting their way out of the riot of gabba-grade drums, game-over effects, and (because it wasn't deranged enough) a slide whistle. One of those cuts is from the 00s, the other from the 90s, both unique and at the same time utterly dancehall. Mysteron is no history lesson, but it should give new-to-ragga listeners a sense of dancehall's evolution, even if they have to puzzle it out through repeat listens. The 80s cuts collected here, from when reggae and dub giants like King Tubby (""Fat Thing"") and Prince Jazzbo (""Great Stone"") went digital after the genre-changing success of Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"", still have plenty of reggae's skank; they squeeze as much of the old live-band swing as possible from drum machines and synthetic bass. By the 90s, beats like Fat Eyes' ""Steel Plate"" and Steely & Clevie's ""Streetsweeper"" had become strange and strident, full of ominous negative space. By the 21st century, Jamaican producers were searching even further afield for fresh sounds, whether the agitated double-dutch clapping of Lenky's ""Diwali"" or island acid house of South Rakkas Crew's ""Red Alert"". Mysteron tends toward the tense and fierce, but there's room for chill beauty, too. Kickin Productions' placid but driving ""What You Gonna Do"", for instance, is a merger of old-school reggae and new-school rhythm programming that looks both backward and forward while being totally captivating. Which is a pretty good way to describe Mysteron as a whole.","Two longtime advocates for Jamaican music, Kevin ""The Bug"" Martin and Soul Jazz head Stuart Baker, highlight dancehall's global evolution on this 2xCD set.

Was I the Wave?,Miracle Fortress,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b012b1335d7bf169a05c/1:1/w_160/ebd5809d.jpg,2011-07-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15638-was-i-the-wave/,Secret City,"Four years ago, Graham Van Pelt earned a Polaris Music Prize nomination for Five Roses, his debut full-length as Miracle Fortress. It was a lush, loop-fed effort that found Van Pelt, formerly a major part of Montreal indie-poppers Think About Life, working with electronic melodies and textures. Nearly everywhere you turned, there was a rich sound or hook or surface to uncover, even if the songwriting frameworks didn't always click. In Was I the Wave?, Van Pelt's first batch of recordings since, he has crafted a record as sleek as it is introverted. Van Pelt has largely shifted his energies here from texture to rhythm, resulting in beat-driven music that sacrifices color (one might also say clutter) for clean lines. Scaling back and toning up lends what's here a new focus; the production values seem purely in service of the song, almost all of which feel like they're presented in easy gelcap form. On Foals-like ""Tracers"", Van Pelt tops a stutter-stepping bass figure and drum machine with sheets of guitar tremolo. Everything is smoothed and stacked seamlessly. If you wanted to follow a bleep or bloop or warble or corkscrewing guitar for a few extra bars, you wouldn't get too far. Like its predecessor, Was I the Wave? features a healthy portion of instrumental interludes, most of which tend to be shorter and more claustrophobic by comparison. While Five Roses' title track was a full-blown experience unto itself, both ""Wave"" and ""Before"" function as quick drone experiments that whine and yawn for introduction's sake; both also jumpstart this record's finest moments. Be it in the curling vocal melody of ""Spectre"" or the precise, high-altitude moves of ""Miscalculations"", each boasts the kind of vital signs missing from the cold arpeggios of, say, first single ""Raw Spectacle"". While Van Pelt has crafted an album that's sharper in most ways than his debut, it could do with a bit more of these tracks' personality and sense of melodic wonder.","Four years after earning a Polaris nomination for debut Five Roses, Montreal's Graham Van Pelt returns with a follow-up as sleek as it is introverted.

N-Plants,Biosphere,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0089d034d5c69bf47e3/1:1/w_160/0b87905b.jpg,2011-07-13 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15626-n-plants/,Touch,"In early February, Biosphere's Geir Jenssen made an album inspired by the architecture and potential instability of Japan's nuclear power plants. A month later, a huge earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. It's healthy to be skeptical about such claims to prescience, but dissembling isn't Jenssen's style: Clearly stated intentions and ideas are a defining feature of the Norwegian ambient-house producer's decades-long career. Plus, N-Plants' sleek contours and foreboding atmosphere easily bear out his theme. Having noted the eerie coincidence, we can dispense with it and let the best Biosphere album since 1997's definitive Substrata stand on its own. Widely regarded as an ambient milestone, Substrata represented a thoughtful dilettante hitting the reset switch. A period of fertile miscellany followed, from the processed Debussy loops of Shenzhou to the long-tone sci-fi marathon Autour de la Lune. Like Substrata, N-Plants is both a consummation and a palate-cleanser. Fully in ambient-house mode, Jenssen fashions together hazy drones, filtered synthesizers, microhouse percussion, and haunting vocal samples over classically plumb lines. Like Kate Simko's 2009 soundtrack for The Atom Smashers, the album can evoke particles of energy swarming through elegant, hulking metal curves. But this one-time archaeology student has never given up his field's patient curiosity and long view, and N-Plants can't be fully constrained by modern context. Ages of ice and stone drift through it, and the Arctic Circle is a looming presence. Each process on N-Plants, be it a glinting synthesizer motif or a low-scudding bass line, logically catalyzes the next. Where Substrata delved deeper and deeper, N-Plants glides over level, endlessly scrolling surfaces. The tracks don't essentially change. At most, they metastasize, as on ""Sendai-1"", where a synthesizer plays iridescently through an aquatic atmosphere; at minimum, cycles of loops perpetually revolve, as on ""Genkai-1"". Either way, blissful hypnosis ensues. N-Plants is a master craftsman's reaffirmation of a fundamental but lapsed tenet of electronic ambient: You set up a conversation between the machines, and then you step out of the way.","The Norwegian producer's latest album, prophetically inspired by Japanese nuclear power plants, is his best since 1997 ambient milestone Substrata.

Whatever's on Your Mind,Gomez,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff15e6ef95969321eb6/1:1/w_160/0907214b.jpg,2011-07-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15606-whatevers-on-your-mind/,ATO,"With apologies to Radiohead and My Morning Jacket, Gomez are exactly the kind of band you'd expect to be signed to Dave Matthews' label. They've developed something of a rep as homespun MOR lifers, with a slight cred advantage in that realm on account of a Mercury Prize win and a modest experimental bent. Still, Gomez have never really made the same record twice. Their latest album's ostensible goal is to bring it all back home and celebrate the band's past 15 years, but doing so in one fell swoop just makes it all the more obvious that they've never managed to develop anything resembling an identity. Who are Gomez after all this time? Whoever they think you want them to be. Though they'd probably be better off rehashing Bring It On's supplicant roots-rock in the current climate, Whatever's on Your Mind begins with a fumbled acoustic strum, and after exactly three seconds of human touch, you get all the elbow grease, brow sweat, and rock'n'roll heart of a dubstep record. Cut Gomez and they bleed Purell. The title track and ""Our Goodbye"" are Larry Crowne on wax: chipper and conflict-free calls to let go of the burdens of modernity, oozing string dross and unctuous bromides. Even when Gomez are at least sounding like they're operating from the groin, on ""Equalize"", a Bo Diddley beat is defaced with eroticism run through at least two Babelfish translations (""She's gorgeous when she sleeps/ Be careful not to wake the monster!"") and a drum solo way funnier than the one in Wayne's World. Of course, if Whatever were merely an easygoing and utterly harmless platter of BBQ background music, big deal-- they put one out every two years or so. I guess I never noticed it on previous records, but this album's lyrics reach a fascinating fulcrum where laziness can actually become an act of aggression. After about 10 minutes, you're locked into an extremely discomforting magnetism that goes beyond mere music. This is the rubbernecking world of Smack DVDs and YouTube bum fights. The cover art is a dead ringer for Gang Starr's greatest hits album, yet I don't think Guru was ever this quotable. Co-vocalist Ian Ball projects with unbothered diction from the roof of his mouth, lending a deadpan absurdity worthy of Dipset to lyrical jewels like this one: ""Light the match/ Burn me down/ Bite the hand/ Bite the sound/ Where's the good in pushing trains from the rail?/ What's so bad about breaking bread going stale/ You hammer the nail."" Meanwhile, Ben Ottewell manages to be the more distinctive singer of the two with a soul-papa bray that recalls Joe Cocker or Eddie Vedder at their most agitated. When he subjects cliché to endurance trials such as ""Please hold on to your heart of gold/ While you struggle against the cold/ You keep dragging that heavy load/ Just let it go,"" it's as transfixing as watching a pitcher in the middle of a perfect game. Most of this stuff comes from the first half of the record, by the way. But it goes on like that, to the point where you could play a dangerous Whatever's on Your Mind drinking game where you take a shot every time Gomez mix metaphors (""a brick wall's falling apart at the seams"") or string together at least two consecutive clichés and render each completely meaningless (""Kill with kindness is what you do/ Flowers in winter bloom""). Seriously, let's all try to stay safe this summer.","After developing something of a rep as homespun MOR lifers, the former Mercury Prize winners look to bring it all back home.

Lifes Rich Pageant (25th Anniversary Edition),R.E.M.,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b006c0084474cd0c1b96/1:1/w_160/3bf8ef8f.jpg,2011-07-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15625-lifes-rich-pageant-25th-anniversary-edition/,CapitolIRS,"The cover of Lifes Rich Pageant features the handsome forehead and full eyebrows of drummer Bill Berry, whose face is cut off at the nose by a low-contrast picture of two buffalo. It's a curious image, embedded with a Buffalo Bill pun, and it playfully nods to the band's refusal to practice expected music-industry behaviors like appearing prominently on their album covers, lip-syncing in videos, writing love songs, or generally revealing too much of themselves beyond the music. Even four albums into their career, they still cultivated an enigmatic presence on Lifes Rich Pageant, starting with that cover and extending to the dropped apostrophe in that title and the mismatched tracklists. Furthermore, the mysterious painted figures and roughly sketched symbols in the liner notes presented the album as something more akin to folk art than folk rock. In direct conflict with that visual impression, Lifes Rich Pageant was R.E.M.'s most pop-oriented and accessible album up to that point. Recording frequently and touring almost constantly, the band had been nurturing a grassroots audience throughout the early 1980s, and Pageant is a pivotal album in their career, representing the moment when their Southern post-punk sound anticipated larger venues and began expanding to fill those spaces. It was also, strangely, their most overtly political collection, with songs addressing environmental crises and political malaise. Rather than sounding sanctimonious, however, such dissent energized R.E.M. and injected more pep into Berry's drumbeats, more incisive jangle into Peter Buck's guitar, and more charisma into Michael Stipe's performance. The album barrels along in just over 30 minutes, lending the songs a sense of purpose. This is music that has to be somewhere. Lifes is celebratory rather than commiserative, with tense tempos fueling heraldic choruses and shout-outs to Woody Guthrie (""Cuyahoga"") and Cole Porter (""Begin the Begin""). Stipe's lyrical dodginess, such a formidable weapon on previous albums, allows the band to come at these issues from obscure angles: With its rousing chorus and pensive bass line, ""Cuyahoga"" mails postcard dispatches from a museum where rivers and plains are artifacts, consigned to diorama and memory rather than reality. ""Fall on Me"" mixes spiritual and consumerist language to deliver a knotted ecological message that takes some unpacking: ""Buy the sky and sell the sky,"" Stipe sings, then changes the Wall Street phrasing: ""Lift your arms up to the sky. Ask the sky and ask the sky, don't fall on me."" Maybe that's why the band chose to close with Mike Mills-sung cover of the Clique's ""Superman"". Seemingly out of place on such a serious-minded album and certainly jarring after the Civil War fever dream of ""Swan Swan H"", it's been derided as R.E.M. at their most superfluous. But that's how they must have felt at the time-- like supermen taking on the world's problems and finding they had unknown powers. In that regard, they're aided significantly by producer Don Gehman, who was then famous for helming John Cougar's early albums. Who knew that Gehman would handle R.E.M. better than folk-rock legend Joe Boyd, who nearly made a muddle of their previous album, Fables of the Reconstruction? In addition to giving the melodic leads their own space, he emphasizes the muscle in Berry's beats and the intricate interaction between the rhythm section. No wonder the drummer's on the album cover: Berry's responsible for the furious pace of the album and enables its abrupt detours into salsa and Nuggets pop. That dynamic makes the remaster on this 25th anniversary reissue sound even livelier and warmer, reinforcing the balance between excitement and gravity that illuminates these songs. It also makes the second disc of demos all the more intriguing, presenting these familiar songs in their most skeletal format. The small flourishes that didn't make the studio versions sound charmingly off-handed: Stipe hums most of ""I Believe"", then punctuates the end with a sing-songy la-la-la. He tries out a harmonica solo on an early version of ""Bad Day"", then uses the instrument to cover for forgotten lyrics. This is R.E.M. at their most ramshackle, a vibe that makes Dead Letter Office a fan favorite even today. Lifes is R.E.M.'s first transition album, one that builds on the innovations of their early releases while hinting at the territory they would cover on Document and Green. It's both epilogue and prologue, yet these songs retain their own specific flavor, as R.E.M. map the borders between small clubs and large venues, between underground and mainstream, between rhythm and melody, between outrage and hope. That in-between quality still sounds invigorating so many years later.","R.E.M.'s pivotal 1986 album is remastered and reissued with an intriguing bonus disc of full-band demos.

Doubles,Cian Nugent,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afff9d034d5c69bf47d2/1:1/w_160/6eeb385b.jpg,2011-07-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15618-doubles/,VHF,"Versatility is prized among instrumentalists. From Nashville country sessions to New York improvisational explorations, the player who can play it all is the player who will likely have gigs. For instance, while cellist Erik Friedlander has played with John Zorn's Masada Chamber Ensemble and with reed adventurer Ned Rothenberg, he's also worked with Korn, Kelly Clarkson, and the Mountain Goats. While Colin Stetson's star is rising with his new solo opus, New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, he's long kept busy with bands from Bon Iver and the National to Angélique Kidjo and Arcade Fire. This is true for guitar soloists, too, but in this realm, the mastery of multiple forms seems to have less to do with a paycheck and more to do with proving you're more than some new-school John Fahey acolyte. From Sir Richard Bishop's pan-everything albums to William Tyler's expansive Behold the Spirit, some of the best guitar music being made right now is that which takes the world in and sounds it back out through a pair of busy hands. Thankfully, no one bothered to tell young Irish guitarist Cian Nugent about that approach: His first widely available album, Doubles, comprises two side-length tracks that take definitive and defined approaches the distance. There's no emphasis on how much he can do or how much he has studied his forebears; instead, he smartly focuses on developing a pair of immersive environments that are continuously compelling for more than 20 minutes at a time. He nails it. The first side, ""Peaks & Troughs"", is an ambitious solo workout for guitar and, eventually, synthesizer. As its name suggests, the tune rises to loud, heavy strums and falls to near-silent picking. A more accurate title might have been ""Knots & Threads"", as Nugent's emphasis seems to be on the horizontal orientation of his music-- that is, the volume matters less than the way he arranges and links his phrases. At points, his hands are busy wrangling great messes of notes that eventually thin out into beautiful and relatively simple statements of melody. Sometimes, though, Nugent is content to examine one note or chord until it resolves into silence, as if he's staring at a huge, tangled ball of yarn but concentrating only on a small, isolated knot somewhere near the middle. That movement creates an inescapable momentum, meaning that, when this track starts, Nugent's deliberately dynamic approach makes it hard to ignore. That same kinetic energy applies to the grand and arching ""Sixes & Sevens"", a piece that Nugent developed with a large ensemble of friends playing drums, strings, horns, and keys. A piece of quiet triumph, ""Sixes & Sevens"" builds around the obvious, continuous guitar line that runs throughout its 24 minutes. Nugent tucks the revelation that he's been listening to music beyond past masters of instrumental guitar into those near-orchestral flourishes. He hints at a free-jazz maelstrom one moment, eerie organ drone music the next; much later, there's a touch of shoegaze rock thanks to some long-tone distortion and a bit of Japanese minimalism via the restraint of the percussion. The perfectly ebullient passages are a mix of Stravinsky, hard bop, and unrepentant pop; given its redemptive sound, it's where the listener finally understands that versatility is something the young Nugent values, too. If Doubles has a fault, it's that Nugent makes no attempt to hide his influences or to do something they haven't previously done. This is, after all, a form that has often been beleaguered by its own reverence and subservience to idols; its recent renaissance, however, suggests the time for showing you can do what someone else once did has begun to recede. Fahey, Rose, Jones, Blackshaw-- all of the top-shelf names in this realm have gone for extended ruminations in the vein of ""Peaks & Troughs"". And Jim O'Rourke stands as the acknowledged master of epics such as ""Sixes & Sevens"", which rise steadily and delicately to glorious but restrained crescendos. Nugent doesn't reinvent either idea on Doubles, but he doesn't have to; he's inarguably mastered them and made them his own, and that's enough for a start.","This Irish steel-string guitarist sometimes reminiscent of James Blackshaw and Jim O'Rourke steps out with an LP containing two epic side-long compositions.

Again and Again,Brilliant Colors,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0035e6ef95969321edc/1:1/w_160/a11ddfae.jpg,2011-07-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15622-again-and-again/,Slumberland,"During The Great C86 Gold Rush of 2008, Slumberland re-established themselves as the label destination for indie-pop bands fusing together clanging distortion and bright, simple melodies. A few bands became popular during that period (the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Crystal Stilts), others developed a modest but reverential fan base (caUSE co-MOTION!), and Black Tambourine-- the very reason Slumberland was founded in the first place-- released an anthology at the height of their renewed influential status. One Slumberland group that went slightly overlooked was San Francisco's Brilliant Colors, who quietly released a 23-minute platter of driving noise-pop called Introducing. With the trend circus that descended upon the genre having moved on to other areas of the music spectrum, Slumberland continues to be the genre's premier label. And Brilliant Colors ever so slightly deviate from their chosen template and deliver another solid album with Again and Again. Here, the breathy vocals aren't buried in the mix so much as lightly blanketed, and the thin singing is naturally overpowered by the clang of the instruments instead of one vocal track being dominated by seven layers of recorded guitars. Opener ""Hey Dan"" sets the pace for an album that is more diaphanous than its predecessor, replacing the punkish twee of Introducing with a more classic guitar pop vibe. While Introducing standouts ""Should I Tell You"" and ""Over There"" prominently featured trebly, fried guitars, the songs of Again and Again cast the bright, summery chord progressions into an autumnal haze, rendering songs like ""Painting Truths"" and ""Value Lines"" more wistful than most of the tunes on their debut. Ultimately, Again and Again suffers the same fate as the Brilliant Colors album that came before it, regardless of exploring a different sound. A lot of the songs are so similar to the ear that it's hard to differentiate most of them between each other; confusing ""How Much Younger"" and ""Hitting Traffic"" is a particularly easy feat. The album's clear highlight is ""Back to the Tricks"", with its driving tension and dramatic chorus providing a well-needed dark spot of mounting anxiety right in the middle of an album rife with major chords and plaintive emotion. As genuinely good as the song is, it ultimately becomes the most memorable tune on Again and Again by default, finding the band stepping out of their comfort zone and throwing their well-played caution to the wind. In the context of Slumberland, Brilliant Colors provide a fair middle ground between the aforementioned Pains and Stilts, neither as capital-P Pop as the former nor as brazenly psychedelic as the latter. While they're still a talented band, you can't help but wonder how much more memorable they'd be if they applied as broad a sense of dynamics to their albums as their labelmates.","SF's Brilliant Colors, easy to lose among the deluge of indie pop bands on Slumberland, return with a solid second album.

Torches,Foster the People,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff713d197565213a39a/1:1/w_160/c05c9571.jpg,2011-07-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15611-torches/,Columbia,"""You say, 'Now what's your style and who do you listen to?'"" Mark Foster sings on Foster the People's first album, before adding defiantly, ""Who cares?"" Later, he punctuates ""Call It What You Want"" with the declaration, ""What I got can't be bought."" With just a few catchy singles and a reputation for energetic live shows, this L.A. trio already sounds defensive and cagey, as if bristling from some imagined attack. We've heard their sort of scene dissection before, mostly from younger bands entering a fractious pop arena (Arctic Monkeys, for instance), but Foster the People-- at distinct odds with their nurturing moniker-- seem to be daring you to categorize them, assess them, or, hell, even engage with them. By way of introduction, it's a bit off-putting, especially soundtracked by demonstratively upbeat West Coast indie-pop buzzed on disco-infused vodka. Once you get past the genre paranoia, Torches actually has enough going for it that Foster the People could conceivably make those same points through their music rather than their lyrics. The songs dodge and weave stylistically, avoiding perceived critical jabs by scavenging pop history for new old sounds. Foster's falsetto alternately evokes Jamiroquai and Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue-- surely the only overlap between those two performers-- while his keyboards volley between early-90s radio dance pop and more recent MGMT doodles. Foster the People's proud maximalism also extends cannily to their songwriting. Foster can write a chorus so bold and simple that you can hear it once and sing it for a fortnight, a tactic that has already made minor hits of ""Helena Beat"" and ""Pumped Up Kicks"" (the latter of which promotes hipster-on-hipster violence). Particularly hoisted onto such dense production, the hooks are so big, blunt, and persistent that even my four-year-old niece counts Foster the People as her favorite band. But on Torches that plays as a crutch as well as a strength. For example, the band runs a two-line melody into the ground on ""I Would Do Anything for You"", never building on it or allowing it to evolve in any way. Still, when this earworm-core works, as on the singles, its pleasures are perfectly modest and enthralling. All of which makes the group's dodginess only more distracting-- no less so considering their rapid successes: a major-label deal, a Billboard top 10 debut, a coveted slot at Lollapalooza, and the devotion of at least one fan who prefers them over the Wiggles or Odd Future. Listing those accomplishments may strike Foster the People as an accusation of selling out, but seriously, relax. As the song that's wedged into my cerebellum goes, ""Who cares?""","With a few catchy singles, the demonstratively upbeat L.A. trio's first album dares you to categorize them, assess them, or even engage with them.

Last Summer,Eleanor Friedberger,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0045e6ef95969321edf/1:1/w_160/b7a51c89.jpg,2011-07-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15623-last-summer/,Merge,"The Fiery Furnaces' 2003 debut album, Gallowsbird's Bark, introduced a band that was utterly, irresistibly restless, from its frequent stylistic and tempo shifts to the ceaselessly discursive patter of frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger. This M.O. of ambitious itchiness was one Eleanor and her brother Matthew would only intensify with albums to come, including the sprawling landmark Blueberry Boat, the conceptually brave family affair Rehearsing My Choir, and the Frankensteinian live document Remember. But a funny thing happened with the female Friedberger on the Furnaces' manifold zigzagging journeys from point A to point Z. Instead of just yelping or intoning strings of verbiage, Eleanor started to inform her delivery with nuance, irony, and wisdom. By 2007's terrific Widow City, the precocious hepcat of the group's early efforts was achieving real pathos on songs like ""My Egyptian Grammar"". The maturation deepened with 2009's I'm Going Away, which found Friedberger not only displaying increased subtlety as a singer but also taking a greater hand in crafting lyrics and melodies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the Furnaces' most polished and measured work to date. Friedberger's debut solo album thoroughly carries over this relatively nascent understanding of her as an artist who can deliver sturdily professional, affecting pop. In fact, Last Summer practically makes I'm Going Away sound like one of the Furnaces' more madcap offerings by comparison. Simple but lovely piano melodies and richly mellow bass shepherd most of the tracks here, though Friedberger has paid lots of attention to filling the album's ample breathing spaces with guitar fills and percussive coloring. The warmly recorded, light-treading effort feels like a throwback to idiosyncratic but solidly crafted albums made in the 1970s by piano-driven popsmiths like Harry Nilsson, Todd Rundgren, and Joni Mitchell. ""Idiosyncratic"" is an important qualifier. The success of Last Summer hinges on Friedberger's ability to put across a vocal and lyrical persona that excuses the fact that her tunes, while finely wrought, are hardly groundbreaking. As a vocalist she ably blends tough-minded forthrightness with a capacity for empathy and vulnerability. That's part of the reason why she can flirt overtly with girl-group sounds (""Heaven""), Motown (""I Won't Fall Apart on You Tonight""), and funk (""Roosevelt Island"") without seeming like an empty-vessel revivalist. It's what really good artists do-- they get away with occasional genre exercise and pastiche because the force of their own personality overrides any potential slavishness in the songwriting. Nor has Friedberger sacrificed any of the serpentine panache of her lyrics. The strict sense of her stories may not always be easy to parse, but their logical slipperiness only strengthens the shifting feelings of longing, loss, estrangement, or nostalgia they convey. Friedberger keeps to the Furnaces' longstanding preoccupation with geography but narrows her scope in a way that heightens the album's sense of intimacy. Aside from ""Inn of the Seventh Ray"", which refers to an acclaimed California locale, Last Summer is all about New York, particularly Brooklyn. But Friedberger isn't interested in name-dropping Williamsburg's hippest bars, preferring to mention old neighborhoods and recreational attractions. Especially given the album's general 70s vibe, Last Summer feels much more like one of Woody Allen's classic cinematic love letters to the Big Apple than the work of any 21st-century scenester. From an artist whose mind and appetites have always ranged so freely, such a cohesive, uncluttered document is doubly revealing.","The Fiery Furnaces singer's solo debut feels like a throwback to idiosyncratic, solidly crafted singer-songwriter LPs from the 1970s.

Dedication,Zomby,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affdc0084474cd0c1b84/1:1/w_160/3e404272.jpg,2011-07-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15617-dedication/,4AD,"Zomby's early records weren't always aggressive, but they were never really demure, either. When his first Hyperdub singles began to attract notice in 2008, he was part of a wave of post-dubstep producers who drew as much from synth-driven 1980s film scores, 8-bit era video game soundtracks, and electro as they did from Jamaica, hip-hop, or UK garage. True, his output wasn't as garish and noisy and abrasive as those made by some of his more intractable collaborators and remixers, and he used the EP format to experiment with tracks more ambient-leaning than club-ready. But they still had distorted riffs, the kind of low-end that makes you adjust your stereo settings to avoid frying your speakers, and hooks more Capcom than Kraftwerk. His first proper album, 2009's Where Were U in '92?, even ditched dubstep entirely to recreate the unruly spirit of the genre's ancestor, hardcore rave. The album sounded far more fine-tuned-- and far less cheap-- than most of the hardcore tunes it paid homage to. But it also suggested Zomby wanted nothing to do with the kind of listener who throws on an electronic album as unobtrusive background noise. If his not-quite-dubstep peer Lone brings the pacific and beatific side of early rave into modern UK beat culture, Zomby brings in the roughness, the menace, the boldness. Even when he goes for almost-beatless psychedelic beauty-- check ""Mercury's Rainbow""-- the results have a disorienting intensity, like John Carpenter incidental music on fast-forward and with the bass at +8. Although it's barely longer than some of his EPs, Dedication is being sold as Zomby's second album, and it's also the strangest, most low-key, and least dance-friendly record he's released yet. It's hard to say to whom Dedication is aimed-- certainly not hardcore dubstep fanatics-- and that's part of its perverse charm, especially since everyone was likely expecting a cohesive, scene-summarizing statement given that this is Zomby's debut for big-time indie label 4AD. It's too jittery and restless and rhythmic to work as comfy ambient music. But while it's very obviously designed to be listened to rather than politely ignored, its choppy transitions and abrupt shifts in mood means it doesn't always flow the way we expect of albums or even home-listening DJ sets. In a way it reminds me of the same hermetic and stuck-between-worlds sound Boards of Canada were mining circa Geogaddi, alternating crunchy beat experiments with ethereal sound-washes and sometimes blurring the two modes together. Dedication never quite reaches (or aims for) the same scope or grandeur as BOC; it's a weirdly personal record, the kind made by a studio loner stringing together little oddities. So maybe call it Zomby's private reels made public, an audio sketchbook filled up with haunted miniatures, something to marvel over if never quite immerse yourself in. It's certainly the most stylistically wide-ranging record he's released yet. It's got some of what Zomby fans have come to love, those icy arcade game sound effects stamped into brief club tracks (""Digital Rain""), but just as often the album chases unexpected directions. For a guy not known for his love of atmospheric murk or soulful smoothness, the blurred vocals on ""Natalia's Song"" evoke the downcast vibe of Burial with just a hint of the Art of Noise circa the sensuous ""Moments in Love"". For a guy not known for working with singers, on ""Things Fall Apart"" Zomby drafts Noah ""Panda Bear"" Lennox as left-field diva, re-imagining the droning repetitions of Tomboy as techno for kids who grew up reading Nintendo Power. But throughout Dedication you're struck by how assured Zomby is with textures outside of ""game cartridge kitsch,"" how he refuses to be slotted into an already-dated subgenre for marketing purposes. ""Haunted"" is like a computer-assisted take on the pensive soundtrack-jazz of DJ Shadow circa Endtroducing... with the vinyl crackle cleaned off. When the beats drop away entirely here, you're more likely to somber acoustic piano (""Basquiat"") than glossy, unnatural keyboards. Barring a few exceptions, Dedication lacks the wobbly jump-up energy of Zomby's best-loved early singles and the rave-y mania of Where Were U in '92. He's more inventive with rhythm than ever; they're just not the kind of rhythms you might have expected. With their finger-snap drums and bass ooze and queasy synths, ""Witch Hunt"" and ""Lucifer"" have the sluggish gravity of Southern hip-hop and grime, outdoing acts like Salem in approximately one-third the time and with no sketchy rapping to dull their creepy pleasures. An entire album of tracks like that might have made for an easy hit, given Zomby's profile and the buzz around similarly druggy instrumental rap from producers like Clams Casino and the wonky trip-hop of the Brainfeeder crew, but Zomby won't make it that easy on himself. Though it doesn't sound like the work of a show-off, Dedication is in many ways the work of a producer pushing himself to see how hard and how far he can push his music into new places. Some might lament the fact that so many tracks feel like teasers pointing toward something longer and more developed, with most of these two- or three-minute ideas fading out as soon as they get a good, eerie groove going. If so, you can take comfort that he's given himself so many possibilities for album number three. Just don't expect a producer this perverse to follow up on any of them, let alone all of them.","On his debut for the 4AD label, the UK producer releases his strangest, most low-key, and least dance-friendly record.

Rave On: A Tribute to Buddy Holly,Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdd9d034d5c69bf47a5/1:1/w_160/a1466983.jpg,2011-07-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15588-rave-on-a-tribute-to-buddy-holly/,FantasyConcord,"Buddy Holly was a singular musician who rose and fell in the era after rock'n'roll had become a distinct art form but before it had become art per se-- in the time, basically, between Elvis and the Beatles. His best songs are spare, nervy miniatures about puppy love riddled by anxiety-- an anxiety Holly made manifest in itchy percussive tracks and an inability to sing more than two lines without breaking into hiccups, the musical equivalent of sweaty palms. (This was in the late 1950s, when non-verbal ejaculations-- vocal or rhythmic-- were the closest a pop singer could get to talking about sex, a time when sex was broken down into gesture and metaphor). Holly's legacy in contemporary music is unclear-- a lot less clear than, well, Elvis or the Beatles. Rave On, a collection of covers released on the anniversary of what would've been his 75th birthday doesn't make it clearer. On a purely instinctual level, it's puffy and depressing, like one of those cable arts-network specials in which a series of talking heads in comfortable-looking chairs say hyperbolically admiring things about dead people everyone agrees the collective ""we"" should respect, but don't actually seem very interested in the dead person at hand. It's an exercise in celebrity that encourages the idea that famous people have mystical ways of relating to each other and the world around them. Until hearing Rave On, for example, I had not thought much about the relationship between Buddy Holly and Kid Rock. Now I have, and I understand it slightly less than I did before. I have no need in my life for very literal performances of songs like ""Everyday"" by people like Fiona Apple, for example, not because I dislike people like Fiona Apple but because 1) the original ""Everyday"" still sounds good to me; and 2) literal performances of songs like ""Everyday"" by people like Fiona Apple make me feel spiritually manipulated: If the same recording had been performed by a singer not named Fiona Apple, I don't think it would've been released. Most of Rave On is just tedious that way. Julian Casablancas sounds bored. Modest Mouse sound bored. Kid Rock sounds like he's trying to sing like Otis Redding but sounds like neither Otis Redding nor Kid Rock. Karen Elson, Jenny O., and Zooey Deschanel all sound nervous and coy and almost indistinguishable. My Morning Jacket's version of ""True Love Ways""-- one of several songs Holly recorded with an orchestra after breaking up his band, the Crickets-- is the only straight-laced cover that transcends its surroundings, in part because I think the song's unimpeachable to begin with, in part because Jim James' high, whittling voice seems preternaturally well-suited to the song's tone: blissful and sweet, but backlit by melancholy. The departures from the originals are generally more entertaining than the straight readings. Lou Reed, an under-appreciated humorist, sings ""Peggy Sue"" with the aimless intensity of a very drunk person grinding through karaoke. ""It's So Easy""-- a song Holly originally sang with a gee-whiz kind of tone-- is turned into a noisy blues about how hard it is to control yourself when you're horny. Happily, comfortingly, it is sung by Paul McCartney, the only Beatle funny enough to write a song about his sheepdog. Patti Smith sings ""Words of Love"", maybe my single favorite Holly song and arguably the genesis of dream-pop. Against all personally established odds, it's stunning, an example of how a jagged, vulnerable voice like Smith's can play against an arrangement so thin it keeps threatening to dissolve-- a basic and effective study in contrast. These covers are fun. They're spirited. They're slightly disrespectful, and in being slightly disrespectful, they feel like a true tribute and consideration of Holly's idiosyncratic spirit. Maybe the fundamental problem is that the compilation's ""Y'all come!"" inclusivity and eagerness to show just how many artists, young and old, love Buddy Holly, has a cold and windy void where its heart should be. In trying to please everyone-- well, you know how that one goes. The younger picks-- Modest Mouse, Julian Casablancas-- are safe. The older ones-- Graham Nash, John Doe-- aren't surprising or challenging, and aren't going to appeal to people who are there to hear the younger ones. It just feels like empty tribute, lip service for someone who really does deserve something more: the dignity of being left alone.","Julian Casablancas, Modest Mouse, Lou Reed, Kid Rock, and many more cover big tunes by Buddy Holly with dispiriting results.

Virtue,Emmy the Great,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc1b1335d7bf1699fd0/1:1/w_160/91d805f7.jpg,2011-07-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15565-virtue/,Close Harbour,"Virtue's cover art includes toy dinosaurs and a sinister-looking Virgin Mary. Like Joanna Newsom's Ys and Bat for Lashes' Two Suns, among other records, the second album from London singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss establishes its central themes and ideas visually before anyone plays a note. As with many such visually upfront records, Virtue is also a conceptually unified listen, influenced heavily by a broken engagement to a man who decided becoming a Christian missionary was a better idea than marrying Moss, otherwise known as Emmy the Great. The offbeat nature of Virtue's artwork extends to its music, as well, though not always successfully. Opener ""Dinosaur Sex"" may have an attention-grabbing title, but despite a creaking, Mesozoic breakdown, the song tends to sag beneath the weight of a less-than-subtle narrative about how one day everything dies. On ""Paper Forest (In the Afterglow of Rapture)"", Moss compares the end of a relationship to something of biblical proportions-- another idea that's interesting in theory, but clumsy and unconvincing in execution. Still, quite a few of the songs here have some nice touches. ""Creation"" adds a spooky synth veneer to bleak electric guitar chords. ""Sylvia"" also benefits from a more electronic feel, with a bouncy synth bass propelling the song lightly alongside a brisk drumbeat. It's probably the poppiest moment on the record, and when vocal harmonies appear towards the end, they carry an airy momentum that's easy to get onboard with. In fact, Virtue comes across best when Moss is at her least kooky. On ""Trellick Tower"", she paints a disarmingly wounded picture over solo piano: ""In those days of living gently/ Something holy used to love me,"" she sings. In this context, free from all the overcooked symbolism, Moss' story at last becomes truly engaging. It's a frustrating hint that when she isn't putting her quirks in the foreground, Emmy the Great can be an appealing, compelling figure in her own right.","London singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss' second album follows a broken engagement to a man who decided to become a missionary.

Are You Falling in Love?,Gold-Bears,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b009b1335d7bf169a04f/1:1/w_160/b97c6bb2.jpg,2011-07-11 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15627-are-you-falling-in-love/,Slumberland,"""Remember that night in 1993? That song made you weep. How could you be so mean, to the boy you longed to meet?"" This is the first line of ""Besides You"", a late-album beauty on Are You Falling in Love?, the debut LP from Atlanta indie poppers Gold-Bears. A little bit emo, a little bit twee, this one lyric is actually striking more for its date-dropping than than its emotional overtones. It fits really well. These four share a lot of DNA with Slumberland labelmates the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. But where the latter initially couched their melodies in the ""noise"" of late-80s noise-pop (they've since swapped that out for the sear of Smashing Pumpkins' guitar squall), Gold-Bears favor the dreamy, moody, semi-blurry sounds Yo La Tengo built their reputation on in the early to mid-90s. All waves of revivalism and nostalgia aside, Are You Falling Love? sounds like it was beamed in straight from 1993. The band works within this particular framework exceedingly well. ""Record Store"" is a tear-streaked, full-tilt opener that leaves a whole lot of foam and fizz in its wake. ""So Natural"" boasts equal amounts of verve, save for a gentle bell melody in its second half. From there the title track coasts into a field of drone, a psychedelic space where Gold-Bears set themselves apart from a lot of their contemporaries. There's no shortage of energy here-- this band can zoom from one row of jangly, interlocking guitar melodies to the next, the sax-laced ""East Station Attendant"" and sugary peaks of ""Totally Called It"" one particularly great mark-- but when they make room to fuck around more intensely with volume and texture, the results can dazzle. Chief songwriter Jeremy Underwood doesn't leave a lot unsaid, packing his poetry in very tightly. And whether or not you've got a heart for the relatively twee, lovesick couplets he's letting loose, a change of pace suits him well. He sings the first several bars of closer ""Yeah, Tonight"" cloaked in echo, an acoustic guitar rattling around at his fingers. There's some word-blurring kick drum and a few spears of guitar noise sent through negative space, but for the most part, this is a stripped down version of most everything else you'll find here. But as this song gains momentum, it blooms into a less strained iteration of what they already do well. ""Tonight we'll fall in love and love again,"" Underwood coos just before he up and pulls a Malkmus: ""And then the drums come in..."" What happens next is a lot like Gold-Bears and Are You Falling in Love?: a pleasant surprise.","Atlanta indie pop group's debut LP sounds beamed in straight from 1993, favoring the dreamy, moody, blurry sounds of the early to mid-1990s.

Two-Way Mirror,Crystal Antlers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe3b1335d7bf169a001/1:1/w_160/3effa940.jpg,2011-07-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15593-two-way-mirror/,Recreation Ltd.,"After a couple seconds of light feedback, drum adjustments, and general milling about, ""Jules' Story"" roars to life and assures us that Crystal Antlers are still a band of volcanic force maintaining the long-haired spirit of 1968 on their second LP. There's enough hurtling Echoplex riffs and organ squall to freak out the squares, but it's all wrapped in three-minute chunks, with verses, choruses, and bridges, prog-psych with all the boring parts sucked out. But despite that opening, just about everything else surrounding the band has changed, and not necessarily for the better. After inking a deal to legendary indie label Touch and Go on the strength of their scalding EP, most listeners caught up with them on 2009's Tentacles. That record was far from a flop, but it was nonetheless a mild letdown, an album saddled by unsteady direction and brittle production. But even if it delivered the goods, it might not have mattered: due to an assortment of financial troubles and a subsequent ""drastic downsizing,"" Tentacles stands as the last new record released by Touch and Go. And while there are times here when Crystal Antlers forego their whiplash unpredictability and seem almost too in control of their sound on Two-Way Mirror, they're clearly reinvigorated. The most noticeable changes are almost completely cosmetic: though they'll never be pretty, Mirror is far easier to face head-on, dialing back the trebly sizzle of its predecessor into a more comfortable, analog warmth. But the major point is how they've managed to fully integrate slivers of gentler sounds-- hints of surf-rock, lo-fi folk, and drone-- and it feels like growth as opposed to acquiescence. Though Crystal Antlers took steps towards accessibility on Tentacles, bassist/vocalist Jonny Bell went along for the ride kicking and screaming. Not sure when the ""On"" switch got hit, but Bell finally can be described as a ""singer"" more than a mere ""vocalist,"" and the lyrics feel like the product of a point of view rather than placeholders. The success of Two-Way Mirror as a whole is mostly borne of fine-tuning, but ""Summer Solstice"" is the keeper on account of its
being the most stunning display of ambition here. It's a near-total stylistic dismantling proving the distance between Comets on Fire and The Photo Album-era Death Cab For Cutie could be traversed in three minutes. A churning, distorted bassline cuts through chimes; vigorous tom-rolls and an ascending chorus of halting sighs are very much in the style of Ben Gibbard, albeit far chestier. Even without the video, there's still an undercurrent of vulnerability that you never really got from these guys before, and it's a legitimately new and exciting direction. Previous singles ""Andrew"" and ""Little Sister"" were nice enough on their own in terms of pushing Crystal Antlers to something more melodic, but sliding into black-lit blooze rock felt like an otherwise restless band taking the path of least resistance. It's a triumph of novelty meeting execution, and the best moments here are when they go the furthest lengths not to repeat themselves. I'm sure it'll slay live-- most Crystal Antlers songs do anyway-- but clearly experimental tracks like the drone-and-bongo instrumental ""Way Out"" and the self-explanatory acid-folk of ""Sun-Bleached"" serve as chances to let the surrounding assault sink in. In addition to being a strong return to form, Two-Way Mirror gives Crystal Antlers some much needed momentum after an unfortunate run of bad timing and bad luck.  Though they're from Long Beach, they do offer some sort of peripheral artistic brotherhood with the teeming retro movement going on in San Francisco. Sure, they might not have the classicist songwriting chops of the Fresh & Onlys or Sonny and the Sunsets, but none of those bands rock this hard either. That stuff is for summer BBQs and backyard parties; Two-Way Mirror is what to spin at the point when you stop caring about noise complaints.","After releasing the final new LP on Touch and Go, Crystal Antlers return with a looser, more experimental record that plays to their strengths.

Within and Without,Washed Out,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affb5e6ef95969321ec9/1:1/w_160/4390b65e.jpg,2011-07-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15614-within-and-without/,Sub PopWeird World,"Despite being the butt of jokes because of its goofy but actually spot-on name, chillwave as an idea and a sound is here to stay. Synthesizers are in; guitar-based rock has taken a backseat to diffuse, rhythmic dance music; and the sound's key influences (broken, blissed-out electronica, hip-hop) have leached into most interesting music happening right now. So, where does a significant subgenre defined by the less-than-lofty goal of manufacturing good vibes go next? The artists either do the same thing with the same synth presets to diminishing returns (Memory Tapes, Small Black, Teen Daze) or they pull a Toro Y Moi on Underneath the Pine and morph into something different altogether. The former creates music that can seem a little too comfortable, and the latter, while admirable, could come over as a bit alarmist-- a calculated response to the critics. The first full-length from Washed Out doesn't have an on-repeat banger like ""Feel It All Around"" on it, and it isn't a sea change. Instead it's a sly, solid release that can fade into the background but has the ability to jump out and take hold of your ears. It sounds great on headphones and even better coming out of speakers in a car or at a party, where it can breathe a little. When Washed Out's Ernest Greene spoke to Pitchfork recently, he noted that he was working on the album in the same place that Goodie Mob were hammering out their reunion album. Quite different from the laptop on mom and dad's back porch that birthed Life of Leisure. Ben Allen, who helped beef up Animal Collective's sound for Merriweather Post Pavilion, produced the album, and while Within and Without isn't too shiny or expensive, the more professional approach rewards multiple listens. There are delicate, lasting production flourishes like the cracking snares on ""Echoes"" and the impenetrable web of fashion-show synths on ""Before"" that give way to an agitated disco-like jerk. Drums are bold and complex, reflecting the almost Pete Rock-aping found on Washed Out's tour-only Untitled EP, and live instruments are used for atmosphere the way samples were before. One of the most chilling, affecting moments of Within and Without happens when cello swings through ""Far Away"". The album's also very sensual and not just because of the American Apparel-lite album cover. Its beats slink along like those Public Enemy drums creeping through Madonna's ""Justify My Love"", and there's a lush, snowy warmth to the production (one of the songs is even called ""Soft""). No longer a stand-alone Adult Swim-released single, ""You And I"", featuring Chairlift's Caroline Polachek, is the soundtrack to a tender, Sunday morning make-out session, and well, just listen to that throbbing bassline. ""Sade but a bit more shy,"" or ""Trip-hop intended for making love rather than fucking"" kinda describes what's going on here. ""A Dedication"", the album ender, eschews airy ornate production for fragile piano and Greene's least mumbly, most direct vocal performance. It's a purposeful period at the end of the album; the point where the record stops worrying about dancing and seems intent to curl up and get cozy. Within and Without is a declaration to snarky ironists that there is nothing to be ashamed of with this sound. ""Feel It All Around"", Neon Indian's ""Should Have Taken Acid With You"", and Toro Y Moi's ""Blessa"" entered this rarefied, awesome space between indie pop catchiness and fragile, narcotic groove, and here's a whole album of tracks on that level. That it comes at a time when others have abandoned the genre or quickly jumped on and then off to raise the stakes and get respectable, is even more impressive. Greene has made an elegant, subtle album in a genre that primarily values the single mp3 and, every once in a while, a 12"" or cassette tape.

Who's Gonna Save the World,Father's Children,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b000b1335d7bf169a03e/1:1/w_160/d3e341e4.jpg,2011-07-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15619-whos-gonna-save-the-world/,Numero Group,"At the end of the 1960s, three high school friends from Washington, D.C.'s Adams Morgan neighborhood formed a doo-wop group together. They sang in all the usual places-- the park, street corners, walking home from school. After adding a fourth member, they got good enough to start playing parties and talent shows. Even as they got gigs, they still didn't have a name until one was given to them when they backed a local soul singer. They became the Dreams. In the late 60s and early 70s, a lot of predominantly black neighborhoods had community centers working hard to get kids off the streets, and Adams Morgan had the People's Center, founded in 1972 by Norman Hylton. The group found itself frequenting the Center, and it was here that it was suggested that they add instrumentalists and become a self-contained band in the Earth, Wind & Fire vein. The singers recruited a band and took up instruments themselves, quickly developing into a tight, flexible unit with a strong original repertoire, much of it written by keyboardist/vocalist Nick Smith. It was a chance event that put the final piece in place, though: the band emerged unharmed from a rollover van accident while touring Virginia. They changed their name to the more hip and current Father's Children, and most of them converted to a form of Islam. Late in the year, the band entered the studio to make its first album. A few personnel changes, tours to Texas and Bermuda, and some sessions that lasted into 1973 later, they had it. But it never was released. The band couldn't get a record deal as its management company folded, and producer Robert Hosea Williams, who didn't get paid for his work, put the tapes in his garage, where they remained until now. Numero Group has dusted them off and finally put together Who's Gonna Save the World, the lost debut of Father's Children. The album reflects the five-month period over which it was recorded quite well, presenting the band as skilled in funky social commentary, string-soaked love songs, Santana-esque jams, psychedelic post-hippie mysticism, sweet harmony soul and artsy fusion. Some of these songs are truly great. ""Dirt and Grime"", a harmony-soaked rumination on the run-down state of the group's neighborhood, erupts with nasty fuzz-toned guitar that seems encrusted with all the filth implied in the title. On ""Kohoutek"", named for a bright comet that appeared in the night sky in early 1973, the flexibility of the band's spiritual, religious, and mystical beliefs is readily apparent as the horn arrangement and whispers of the title give way to spoken lyrics about the body being a prison for the soul. ""In Shallah"", a gorgeously swaying harmony number, is titled as though it has openly Muslim themes (that's Arabic for ""God Willing""), but it really doesn't-- it's more of a sweet soul tune with spiritual overtones. There are bits that haven't dated well-- the muddled spoken conclusion of ""Everybody's Got a Problem"" is one, with members speaking such profundities as ""war's a drag, man""-- but overall it's a cool album that probably could have done well had it been promptly released. It captures the zeitgeist of its age as well as anything by Earth, Wind & Fire, with not much less commercial appeal. Father's Children endured through the end of the 70s, ultimately releasing a self-titled LP recorded in Hollywood for Mercury Records in 1979, and another after briefly reuniting in 2005. Neither of those went anywhere, and while this release can't quite correct history, it does finally bring to light a good would-be debut by a worthy band that just never caught its break.","Numero Group unearths a transfixing unreleased 1973 debut from a psychedelic soul band from Washington, D.C.

Glacial Glow,Noveller,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00113d197565213a3a9/1:1/w_160/7459211d.jpg,2011-07-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15620-glacial-glow/,Weird ForestSaffron,"Sarah Lipstate, the Brooklyn-based guitarist who calls her solo project Noveller, has been busy the past two years. She's made four albums and two split releases in that time-- all interesting forays into noise, drone, and ambience. But Glacial Glow is a leap forward. Confident and consistent, it bears a musical personality that had been somewhat hidden. Previous Noveller records could drift into vagueness, but here Lipstate gives each track a distinct theme, telling a series of wordless stories. Her sounds are more like syllables and sentences than abstract textures. That makes Glacial Glow her most melodic album, but that's not why it's her best. The increased accessibility is simply a byproduct of finding a stronger, bolder voice. It's also a byproduct of her focusing more on her guitar than the effects pedals she attaches to it. Notes and chords take center stage, where once they could get blurred in echo. There's still lots of atmosphere here, but the causes of that effect-- the basic act of plucking a string or strumming a chord-- assume prominence. According to Lipstate, these songs began with her playing guitar unamplified in bed, and the simplicity and intimacy of that approach comes through in the end results. The distance between initial idea and what we hear feels short. Each track has a patient, searching quality, as if she's discovering sounds with us, never rushing through them or piling them up. In that sense, Lipstate reminds me of that singular model of patience, Loren Connors. Her sound is certainly busier than his, but you can hear Connors' painterly fortitude on ""Alone Star"", a kind of frozen Western theme in which bassy plucks tremble in the moonlight and high-end curls sparkle in the distance. Other artists echo here as well-- I hear a little Sonic Youth in the loops of ""Waxwing"", a little Papa M in the pastoral strings of ""Tuesday Before Poland"", a little of Explosions in the Sky's cinematic drama in the lilting ""Glacial Wave"". But often when an artist gets stronger, the music becomes more universal, and reference points become easier to hear. It may sound paradoxical, but these evocations help make Glacial Glow distinct. What most distinguishes the album is Lipstate's boldness. Every song steps forward even as it envelops, and most have short titles that eschew irony or indecision. Take the closer, which is bluntly titled ""Ends"" because that's what it does, with gentle tones slowly disappearing into the horizon. If you're familiar with Lipstate, you might notice I've gotten this far without mentioning her many other projects and collaborations, which come up in most reviews and articles about her. Those are interesting too, but they're irrelevant to Glacial Glow, a work in which she's fully earned the right to be considered completely on her own.","Prolific drone artist Sarah Lipstate comes into her own with her best and most distinctive record yet.

116 & Rising,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff8b1335d7bf169a032/1:1/w_160/959b1142.jpg,2011-07-08 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15612-116-rising/,Hessle,"Since 2007, Hessle Audio has played host to a smattering of singles from UK bass music's most exciting names, including James Blake, Untold, and Blawan. The label has also released work by its co-owners: David Kennedy (Pearson Sound/ Ramadanman), Kevin McAuley (Pangaea), and Ben Thomson (Ben UFO). If fellow UK imprint Hotflush explores the breadth of bass sounds in electronic music, Hessle explores their depth, stitching the concept of sternum-shaking low-end into the fibers of their style. This approach has led to a rupturing interpretation of dubstep and techno that often concedes beauty or charm but has not precluded curiosity or exploration. The label hosted what is arguably Blake's most progressive work (The Bells Sketch EP), and Kennedy has also been instrumental in electronic music's adoption of the footwork sound (an influence that pervades Addison Groove's ""Fuk tha 101"" and Pearson Sound's ""Stifle"" here). 116 & Rising, Hessle's first full-length release, offers one disc of classic label cuts and one disc of new material. The label's tendency to sequester itself in 12""s, as well as its notoriously stingy release schedule, makes the retrospective portion particularly valuable. Presented at dance-friendly tempos, these 12 tracks are split among only seven producers, forfeiting range for tense, agile deployment. The tracks are not about establishing a mood; they concern themselves first with bass and second with the ways rhythm can aid, embellish, circle, and attack that bass. Blawan, the label's most exciting young product, enacts this most clearly on ""Fram"", which is the sound of a Transformer continually unfolding: exponentially mechanistic, ugly but undeniably neat. The disc of new materials suffers both in comparison to the classic material and from a frantic energy never properly corralled. Still, there is plenty to digest: Untold takes his Duplo-block chords and applies them to Chicago house on ""Cool Story Bro"". Addison Groove's ""Fuk tha 101"" proves the artist also known as Headhunter has plans for the footwork sound grander than the indelible ""Footcrab"". Pangaea continues an uninterrupted run of excellent singles with ""Runout"", a tart, acidic current of noise. (A ""Second Version"" of Blake's ""Give a Man a Rod"" feels sadly like an attempt to include a ""New James Blake track!"") 116 & Rising offers a clearer vision of where Hessle has been than where it's going. It's OK to care less about such visions and more about a collection of kickass tracks (of which 116 offers many), though Hessle's cautious nature suggests that coherence matters. That the new disc includes some producers-- D1, Peverelist, Randomer-- that the label considers kin indicates that the close-knit, communal aspect of Hessle isn't going away. At a bare minimum, 116 provides a third totem (after Hyperdub's 5 and Hotflush's Back and 4th) for anyone requiring a quick primer on the last half-decade of progressive bass music. It is a tech-y, aggressive totem, but don't conflate that aggression and lack of expanse with a dearth of creativity.","UK bass label Hessle Audio offers its first full-length release: one disc of classic label cuts and another of new material.

Kingston Story,Vybz Kartel,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affa9d034d5c69bf47ca/1:1/w_160/e75b088b.jpg,2011-07-08 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15615-kingston-story/,Mixpak,"What happened to Vybz Kartel? In the early years of the previous decade the Jamaican DJ possessed a nimble versatility that well matched dancehall's musical promiscuity, switching between slippery, smoke-damaged double-time raps and hypnotic sing-song choruses with an agility that for a time seemed unmatched. But at some point in the second half of the decade, Kartel may have begun to feel burdened by his own success, his regular status as Jamaica's number-one DJ also making him more vulnerable to demands that he represent the community rather than just its gun-wielding, girl-grabbing, ganja-imbibing contingent. Whatever the reason, on his most recent albums Kartel has dramatically switched up (or, rather, down) his flow, increasingly backgrounding his rapping in favor of a ponderous, Auto-Tune-damaged tenor moaning over deflated, synth-heavy arrangements, coming on like Mavado's ""On the Rock"" for a post*-808s & Heartbreak* era. Pon Di Gaza in particular was so rigorously downbeat, grayscale, and bloody long that listening to the whole thing in one go felt like an absurd endurance test. But Kartel hasn't lost all contact with his erstwhile bad-boy self; on one-off tracks he still regularly comes as hard and fast as ever, and I suspect it's these more than recent albums that have protected his position at the top of dancehall's heap. Moreover, sometimes Kartel in downer mode can work fantastically. On the recent ""Coloring Book"", his oddly melancholy posturing captivates, as he boasts of his irresistibly tattooed skin over a gorgeously bittersweet concoction of piano chords and descending strings. But ""Coloring Book"" doesn't grace Kartel's new album, Kingston Story, and there's precious little here that is nearly as enticing. It's as if Kartel has consciously rejected anything that's too dense, too wordy, too clearly casting him in the mold of DJ-as-rapper rather than universalist singjay. Which is a shame, because while Kingston Story is less exhaustingly morose than Pon Di Gaza, it's also more tepid, a conscientiously inoffensive collection both lyrically and sonically. The thematic and stylistic range is established well enough on the first two tracks, the atmospheric and reflective ""Jamaica"" and the clattering dance-pop of ""Beautiful Girl"". If the becalmed stasis of the former signals Kartel's desire to transcend the role extroverted dancehall host, the latter just as clearly underscores the goal of seducing Western ears. This would all be well and good if these tunes were merely opening gambits on an album that struck a variety of poses, or at least continued to push these divergent directions into new territory. Instead they mark the outer limits of the venture, and while it's a compact album by dancehall standards Kingston Story starts to feel repetitive long before it winds down. Subjected to the torments of Auto-Tune, Kartel's singing voice-- already somewhat weak and raspy, though that's hardly unusual for dancehall-- becomes a mournful, choked-up whimper, all the more incongruous for bleating out otherwise-upbeat protestations of sexual prowess. At times there's something compelling about this: On ""Breathless"", Kartel moans and whispers over a stark, beautiful arrangement of shimmering synths, ominous bass, and ghostly backing vocal effects, sorrowfully treading the sex/death tightrope where the flush of desire coincides with chilling presentiments of mortality. But for the most part Kingston Story is neither powerful nor distinctive enough for this sense of vulnerability to have much purchase. Such timidity is particularly disappointing because it coincides with the most enthusiastic upswing in dancehall's embrace of the weird and the wired in nearly a decade. Dancehall's new trends need Kartel, who's always had the gravitas to keep his head and his flow even in the most arcane settings. He'd do well to rediscover his insouciance for a while.","The Jamaican DJ's new album is less exhaustingly morose than 2009's Pon Di Gaza, but it's also more tepid, both lyrically and sonically.

We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves,John Maus,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe4c0084474cd0c1b62/1:1/w_160/c460b772.jpg,2011-07-08 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15596-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/,Ribbon Music/Upset the Rhythm,"John Maus first gained notice while collaborating and playing with fellow Cal Arts classmate Ariel Pink more than 10 years ago. Though both have since developed cultish followings by releasing distinctive takes on murky lo-fi, Maus has steeped his music in new wave signifiers, an association furthered by his deep, commanding voice. Whether he's evoking Joy Division's Ian Curtis or Bauhaus' Peter Murphy, Maus opts to abstract the genre, inserting noise into unexpected places and walking the line between sincerity and surreality. From the beginning, he's been an artist fascinated by the parameters, paradoxes, and possibilities of pop. Earlier this year, Maus took a walk through New York's Central Park Zoo with a journalist from Self-Titled. ""I didn't realize that the music I was making was especially weird,"" he says in the piece. ""Honestly, I thought I was making Top 40 kind of stuff. It wasn't until people kept telling me so that I realized my work was thought of as something 'other' than that."" If you're at all familiar with the Minnesota native's swampy retro-futurist synth-pop, you may understand why he might place emphasis on the word ""other."" One experience with his body of solo work (or brave live performances) makes clear that his could be categorized as ""outsider"" art, but it's difficult to say that without also seriously considering why. He makes thought-provoking music that's disguised as something else. We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves, his latest full-length, is the most vibrant and toothsome expression of Maus' pursuits yet. He keeps his vocals awash in gothic reverb and echo-driven effects, blurring the lines between what he's saying and emoting. Sometimes, as on ""Cop Killer"", a Jan Hammer-indebted number on which Maus sings over an iced bed of keys, the results are outlandish and oddly funny at the same time, in the way that certain scenes in David Lynch films can leap from chilling to comically exaggerated. (""Cop killer, let's kill the cops tonight/ Cop Killer, kill every cop in sight,"" he sings.) And then there's ""Matter of Fact"" immediately thereafter, a song whose staccato, orc-like chorus line is ""Pussy is not a matter of fact."" They're not the kind of earworms you want to find yourself singing aloud in public, but it might happen anyway. Sonically, Maus works a minimal, primitive setup: sputtering drum machines and an arsenal of 1980s-vintage synth presets undercut his lyrics just as much as those exaggerated, often grotesque vocal turns do. Sometimes, these songs seem to exist solely to pose questions: Top 40 cheese or ironic cool? High-brow or low-brow? Honesty or posturing? Artifice or reality? But what makes We Must Become his finest full-length yet is how fluidly he communicates it all by foregrounding melody. On ""Keep Pushing On"", Maus' monastic, cellar-level singing lends the song the feel of a Gregorian chant-led exercise tape. Though the vocals and basslines on arpeggiated fever dream ""Quantum Leap"" mirror Joy Division's to an almost cartoonish degree, you still get a good sense of Maus' persona in the music. There's a genuine, almost maniacal sense of glee in the way he seems to approach each turn. When Maus takes the stage, he plays with notions of performance by singing over his own backing tracks. He pogos, he screams, he runs-in-place and pulls his hair and spits and sweats and clenches up until he looks like he might burst through his button-down and chinos. It's hard to look away. Now Maus has a full set of songs whose architecture is just as sophisticated and riveting in actuality as it is in theory. While earlier records have been riddled by experiments gone awry (see: ""Rights for Gays"" and ""Tenebrae"", from 2007's Love Is Real), they also didn't feature the revolving parts and aerodynamic hooks of ""Believer"", the closing track here and one that glitters from any angle. And although there's another vocalist at his side in the lullaby lilt of ""Hey Moon"" (songwriter Molly Nilsson, who wrote and performed the song on her 2008 album These Things Take Time), the way Maus sings to the heavens makes it sound as though he's no longer alone with his thoughts. Spend a lot of time with this record, and it's hard not to feel like you're right there with him.","The avant-pop songwriter whose career has intersected with that of Ariel Pink focuses on melody and delivers a delightfully weird full-length.

OX 2010: A Street Odyssey,Vast Aire,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff5ea9e61561daa6539/1:1/w_160/5d2bc8d2.jpg,2011-07-07 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15609-ox-2010-a-street-odyssey/,Fat BeatsMan Bites Dog,"Cannibal Ox's 2001 debut, The Cold Vein, continues to stand as an indie-rap masterpiece. The duo's members, Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, had something to prove. Definitive Jux label head El-P, who produced the album, was fired up to define himself post-Company Flow. And underground hip-hop was at the perfect point to accept a new vanguard for post-Wu-Tang spiritual headknock. But bridges have been burned, beefs over business have gone down, and all the players have been left to their own devices. The more time that passes, the easier it is to wonder how well the sum of CanOx's parts could survive independently of each other. For a while after the release of 2008's Dueces Wild, it looked like Vast Aire was finally starting to shift the conversation from ""when's the next CanOx album?"" to ""when's the next Vast album?"" But any feeling of momentum from that release has vanished on OX 2010: A Street Odyssey. It takes 35 seconds for the space-age triumphalism of ""Nomad"" to get to this cornball lyric: ""And even though I do yoga/ Trust me, Vast Aire has never been a poseur."" Over a beat evoking some sort of futurist celestial majesty, that head-slapper of a punchline is only the first of several moments where it feels like Vast is stuck somewhere between badass and goofball. In splltting the difference, he just sounds stilted. Other verses tread a similar line. ""My dad is a Magnum/ I'm a son of a gun,"" Vast jokes on ""2090 (So Grimmy)"". The wicked-carnival scenario of ""Merry Go Round"" has just the minimum amount of dignity to keep it from seeming like a bid for Juggalo crossover fandom. And the goopy wuv-rap of ""Horoscope"" is way too treacly from someone who once poured his heart out on The Cold Vein's devastatingly sincere ""The F-Word"". The most cringeworthy moment comes in closer ""Battle of the Planets"", where Vast actually recycles the refrain from ""Scream Phoenix"", turning The Cold Vein's most life-affirming moment into a grudge taunt at the expense of former Weathermen crewmate Cage. His deliberate, heavily enunciated growl underlines every embarrassing lyrical decision in red pen. At least OX 2010 doesn't feel entirely like one MC stranded in his own malaise. The beats are serviceable, with some unostentatious boom-bap from the likes of Kount Fif, Harry Fraud, and Ayatollah. And the guest verses range from complementary mediocrity (Cappadonna treading water on ""I Don't Care"") to complete upstagings (Guilty Simpson going berserk on ""The Verdict""). Unfortunately, the album's most headline-grabbing collaboration-- a brief reunion with Vordul on ""Thor's Hammer"", with a re-used Raekwon verse from Blood on Chef's Apron taking the first slot-- is also its biggest disappointment. There are plenty of ways to get people to stop clamoring for a Cannibal Ox reunion. This album's the saddest one.","One-half of legendary indie-rap duo Cannibal Ox follows 2008's Dueces Wild with an album that briefly features CanOx partner Vordul Mega.

It's like building sculptures out of thrift-store finds and junkyard debris, so naturally some of his collages can sound nostalgic. But associating Copeland with anyone besides himself or his group Black Dice feels wrong. He really inhabits his own universe, one he started before current cut-ups took to scouring VHS tapes and video games for source material. And his fractured rhythms, which can approach bouncy hip-hop loops, are as close to the Bomb Squad or J Dilla as Washed Out or Ducktails. In fact, where those latter artists often deal in blurry memories of decades past, Copeland's music reminds me more of a specific 1980s moment-- the scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off where Matthew Broderick's character plays ""Blue Danube"" on a keyboard programmed with coughs and wheezes. Back then, the thrill of using synths and samplers came in making any sound into a note, and making any string of noises into a song. Copeland still seems fascinated by that simple idea and the unlimited potential it implies. On Waco Taco Combo, his latest LP, that fascination results in some of his catchiest songs to date. What makes them so catchy is also what makes them simple-- hard, straight-ahead beats. Which is not to say that any song here is straightforward. They all creak and groan with lopsided motion. Drops of noisy oil leak out and loose screws rattle as Copeland's musical jalopy sidles down the street. But each track eventually digs into a bumping groove, which becomes glue that holds all the rickety parts together, or a magnet around which Copeland's furry filaments align into body-moving tuneage. It's a pretty singular pleasure to nod your head to such cartoonish music-- it's as if Copeland stole Wile E. Coyote's ACME bomb kit, and turned the explosions into beats. On side two of Waco Taco Combo, all the string and tape that Copeland uses to hold his sounds together finally snaps, and a bunch of sonic detritus comes spilling out. In one side-long track, ""Spangled"", Copeland's beats become more random and less fluid, his scenes fused via random jump cuts rather than smooth dissolves. Some might see ""Spangled"" as a doggie bag, filled with leftovers whose connections are hard to see. How appetizing you'll find this stew depends on your tolerance for collage as an end in itself. To me, it's a nice contrast to the album's smoother songs. But even if you can't stomach all 17 minutes, there's more than enough nuggets on Waco Taco Combo to sink your teeth into.","Sonic collagist and Black Dice member's latest LP boasts some of his catchiest songs to date.

Is This Hyperreal?,Atari Teenage Riot,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff65e6ef95969321ebe/1:1/w_160/952fc57c.jpg,2011-07-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15610-is-this-hyperreal/,Digital HardcoreDim Mak,"Atari Teenage Riot existed at a previously unimaginable fulcrum of genres, using every ingredient they could find to come up with an ecstatically assaultive squall. Their twisting, roiling blare had elements of pounding industrial, of mouth-foaming hardcore punk, of brutally fast hardcore rave, of scraping electronic noise, of thrash-metal bombast, of wriggling drill-n-bass, of Bomb Squad-style attack-beats. Their specific chaotic combination added up to German-accented ridiculousness (""Deutschland! Has gotta! Diiieeee!"") screamed over hyperspeed 808 pounds and digitally treated guitar fuzz; it seemed scientifically engineered to annoy as many people as possible. It was impossible to dance or talk or read or drive or do anything else while they were playing. I tried so hard to like them, and I mostly succeeded, even though my friends would give me tons of shit anytime I played their records. For a brief moment in the mid-1990s, the group seemed like the future. They released records on Grand Royal, they opened the much-touted Rage Against the Machine/Wu-Tang Clan tour, and they spearheaded their own little mini-scene with their Digital Hardcore label. But after 11 years of inactivity, it's pretty clear that they didn't exactly change the conversation. You can detect pieces of their style in a few musical movements that have come along since: the Teutonic-accented confrontationalism of electroclash, the low-budget rabble-rousing computer-pop of early M.I.A., the squealing brickwalled dance-metal of Justice. But Atari Teenage Riot didn't transcend their moment. So their new album, Is This Hyperreal?, is a curious thing indeed: a nostalgic work that evokes an idea of the future that turned out to be absurd. Listening to it is like watching a remake of Johnny Mnemonic. The reconstituted Atari Teenage Riot of 2011 isn't really the same group from that mid-90s moment. Unhinged hypeman Carl Crack died in 2001. Lead screamer Hanin Elias is long gone, though replacement Nic Endo sounds almost exactly like her. There's also a new member: laughably clumsy American MC CX Kidtronik (sample lyrics: ""My fist! My fist! I bang my fist! Against a concrete wall!""). But even with a ton of membership turnover, Atari Teenage Riot sound very, very similar to what mastermind Alec Empire first unleashed a decade and a half ago. Then again, it's not like those early records left a whole lot of room for aesthetic advancement (what, were they going to find a new genre of noisy assault music to incorporate?). But it's still pretty weird that this band's overwhelming fury has not mellowed in the slightest since they've been away. They're not teenagers anymore, but you'd never know it from listening to them. That's not exactly a compliment. Teenagers experience politics in absolutes; red-faced sloganeering makes a lot more sense to a human ball of hormones than nuanced discourse ever could. But when a grown man roars, ""They want to turn the Internet into their personal global chessboard!"" it just sounds goofy (who's they?). Some of the lyrics on Is This Hyperreal? push those tendencies to dizzy extremes. Consider, for example, this: ""Capitalism, you're a little fat man in a big expensive car hanging over a ravine here!"" Or this bit of anti-Internet agitprop: ""When the authorities catch up with us, and they will, it's not such a good idea to leave traces and expose your whole network at once!"" (Yes, Atari Teenage Riot have their own iPhone app. Why do you ask?) Musically, too, it's the same hyperspeed noise-blast format they've been working forever, beyond the odd moment of Crystal Castles-style mutated video-game bloop. When ""Shadow Identity"" turns into deeply pretty M83-ish epic synthpop for a minute, it's a legit shock: This band learned a new trick! But it's just for a few seconds at the end of the song, and then it's over. Redundant as it may be, though, Is This Hyperreal? succeeds simply as unintentional nostalgia, at least for someone who experienced the band the first time around. Opening track ""Activate!"", for instance, is pretty much Crystal Method-style big beat, but with more guitar fuzz and screaming, and it's just fun. The fact that Atari Teenage Riot still exist in any form, and that they're still making these sputtering tantrums, is almost admirable. They're gloriously silly anachronisms, and I'm not sorry to have them back in my life. My friends probably aren't too happy, though.","The German electro-punks' first album in years is a curious thing indeed: a nostalgic work that evokes an idea of the future that turned out to be absurd.

Up until now we knew him mostly for some high-profile remixes and his original, instrumental tracks, which were solid but nothing to flip out over. He was loosely dubstep in the way, say, Floating Points is, using the genre as a rough guide but also weaving in several other strains of contemporary bass music. But with this self-titled LP, SBTRKT is something different: Recruiting guest vocalists to sing over his arrangements, he's working more as a traditional producer, and his music, while still grounded in experimental bass, is inching much closer toward pop. You might call what SBTRKT is doing here ""post-dubstep"". That's not a totally accurate term (for one, he's building off more than just that one genre), but his approach is certainly similar to what guys like James Blake and Jamie Woon have been up to in the last year or so. The central differences here are that a) SBTRKT doesn't sing himself (he's brought in vocalists Sampha, Jessie Ware, Roses Gabor, and Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano for that); and b) his music is more immediate than both Blake's and Woon's. Rather than go for showy, scene-stealing productions, he keeps things tight and purposeful: The focus is on the overall song and the vocal, and beats are just one part of that equation. The record pits some emotive and occasionally downcast singing against arrangements that throb nicely, and there's a good sense of balance and variety throughout. First single ""Wildfire"", for example, is a squelchy, Timbaland-like pop moment, where ""Trials of the Past"" is spooky and slower-paced. The reason the tracks work individually and as a whole is that SBTRKT has a keen sense of how to draw the most out of his guest vocalists. UK singer Sampha, who is featured heavily on the LP, has a warm, higher-range croon that seems built for R&B, and SBTRKT arranges accordingly, giving him stuttery tracks that draw from American urban pop and smoothed-out drum'n'bass. Importantly this makes the album greater than the sum of its parts. ""Dubstep dude with a bunch of singers"" becomes something much more collaborative and cohesive. SBTRKT is ultimately a colorful and highly enjoyable future-pop record, an extension of bass culture but not indebted to it. The other crucial thing is that the album is actually quite accessible, which is something that's eluded similar post-bass projects. Those other guys-- Blake, Woon-- might have a purer artistic vision, but of the three, SBTRKT has arguably assembled the broadest and most listenable collection of songs. And in a field where approachability isn't always given a ton of weight, it feels brave to take this more song-oriented path and pull it off.","UK producer's debut full-length inches closer to pop than his post-dubstep contemporaries James Blake or Jamie Woon.

Player Piano,Memory Tapes,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd8c0084474cd0c1b4d/1:1/w_160/d757a2ef.jpg,2011-07-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15582-player-piano/,Carpark,"Taking the long view, Seek Magic strikes me as a great album made by someone who really doesn't care much for the format. It's understandable since Dayve Hawk's prior gig Hail Social released a couple of LPs of timely, danceable indie rock while perpetually hemmed in between positive notice (SPIN Band of the Day, a deal with Polyvinyl) and a legitimate breakthrough. I can't imagine being too enthusiastic for the obligations of the traditional album cycle after all of that. Hawk's subsequent release of singles, remixes, and other one-offs under a clutch of confusingly similar names (Memory Tapes, Weird Tapes, Memory Cassette) announced his newfound artistic direction as a cry of freedom, and he didn't show much interest in performing live either. But more eyes are on him than ever for Player Piano, and he's still got a thing for demurral. He's already claimed his third record to be almost done, allegedly a collection of Black Sabbath-influenced dirges. You would think such diffuse focus would eventually catch up with him, yet Player Piano finds him more concentrated and economical than ever. Unfortunately, it comes off more like complacency than conviction, that Hawk's either holding back on us, misreading his true strengths, not recognizing the need to rise to the occasion, or possibly all three. While the individual songs on Seek Magic were excellent themselves, what made that record stand out was its comprehensiveness. Whether you enjoyed Hawk's laconic and fuzzy melodies, gelatinous electronic textures, or pulsating dance music, you weren't too far from any of those at a given time (and you could find them all on ""Bicycle""). Player Piano lacks that crucial cumulative effect, and instead Hawk presents himself more as an able if indistinct singer-songwriter than a molder of pure sound. And it isn't any sort of reactionary statement against chillwave: He stood out in my mind as the most forthright vocalist of his peers to begin with, his feminized coo relying more on elegant melodic curvature than foggy evocation. He gets a proper showcase with single ""Wait in the Dark"", on which Hawk is a true frontman rather than a texture over a streamlined arrangement. This shift makes Memory Tapes successfully come off like a sleek rock band than a home-bound project. Though he's comfortable doing true pop music, as opposed to pop determined by immediate context, his more extroverted moments can be as cloying: ""Sunhits"" rousts Player Piano from a mid-record plateau, but the overly chipper guitar doodles and Hawk's dodgiest and most clearly enunciated hook (""Nothing's a dream if you never wake up""-- he's never been a lyrics guy) strain too hard to fulfill the prophecy of its title. And how ""Today Is Our Life"" hits me depends almost entirely on my current mood: There are times when I find it to be a genuinely buoyant tambourine-shaking shimmy of breathless hooks; there are others where that cornpone guitar solo and sitar-laced coda are the stuff of shopping mall karaoke booths. It cuts to what's really troubling about Player Piano, how such a committed studio geek like Hawk delves into production-intensive 60s sunshine pop and ends up with such a weirdly distracting 2-D sound that leaves it sounding unfinished, demo-level, even. Its mood lighting is similar to that of Seek Magic, but the underlying instrumentation is often flat and airless, sucked dry of his typically evocative detailing. Paradoxically, the tracks that are proudly sample-free and reliant on acoustic instrumentation are the ones that are the least dynamic and eerily evoke the disembodied artificial intelligence of keyboard presets. ""Yes I Know"" submerges its carnivalesque pinwheels and Hawk's vocals in a waterlogged muffle that you expect to lift at some point, but it goes relatively hi-fi still without coming up for air. The same goes for ""Offers"" and ""Worries"", nice enough experiments in bubblegum funk and digitally retouched Nuggets Farfisa-rock that lack any sort of immersion or fluidity. And the instrumentals no longer feel like they're on equal footing, not that they do much to make themselves noticed. ""Humming"" is a palate cleanser of skittering drum machines and languid atmosphere begging for a longer work to play a part in, and while the first half of ""Fell Thru Ice"" finds Hawk exploring newly unmoored song structure, Part II is simply a lesser replay of Seek Magic tricks. It gets chased with ""Trance Sisters"", which deserves some credit as a buzzer-beating freak-out of maximalism, even if it's basically a compressed version of ""Bicycle"". All of which makes Player Piano a curiosity more than a flop. In fact, the sturdy hooks and thin arrangements make it ripe for remixes, and considering the similar wavelength he was on with Andorra, I wonder what Dan Snaith might be able to do with the raw materials here. But while I'd love to say Hawk's ear for melody or texture is what differentiates Player Piano from the dozens of agreeable but wholly unremarkable electro-pop records that get a pass, truth is, it's ultimately the comparison to Seek Magic that makes it such a letdown.","Following on Seek Magic, his satisfying debut of hazy dream-pop, Memory Tapes' Dayve Hawk goes for more of a full-band sound with mixed results.

Gardens & Villa,Gardens & Villa,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afed9d034d5c69bf47ba/1:1/w_160/a5d306cf.jpg,2011-07-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15603-gardens-villa/,Secretly Canadian,"On their 2008 tour for Devotion, Beach House had a t-shirt for sale at their merch table featuring the album title spelled out in the sort of gothic font you see on death-metal album covers, creating a cheeky contrast between the grim presentation and the band's tranquil hazy-headed dream-pop. But those two aesthetic poles blurred into one upon hearing the striking debut single from Gardens & Villa. Ideal for summertime strolls through a cemetery, ""Black Hills"" pits vibraphone chimes against an icy synth pulse overtop an unnervingly steady beat. And while ""Black Hills"" presents magisterial images of mountains, seas, and high tides, its environment feels tensely claustrophobic, with Chris Lynch's elastic, androgynous voice projecting serenity and severity in equal measure. It's the sort of song you could easily imagine Beach House coming up with, were they to follow-up the lushness of Teen Dream with something more sinister. But the self-titled debut album that ""Black Hills"" opens shows Gardens & Villa to be something more complex than just a Beach Hearse. That such a moody outfit hails from sunny Santa Barbara is but a surface indication of their curious qualities. With a lyric sheet that's preoccupied with nature and mysticism-- not to mention a singer who's not afraid to whip out a flute-- Gardens & Villa could easily be pegged as hippies. But they're also keen on playing up the artificial qualities of their music, foregrounding synthesizers and mechanized, metronomic rhythms to create a peculiar hybrid of 1960s and 80s sensibilities. (One song bears the particularly apt title of ""Neon Dove"".) As such, the austerity of their sound can make them seem both sternly serious and, at times, rather goofy. (See: the ping-ponged synth-pop of ""Spacetime"", wherein the title is repeated in a comically spooky voice, as if it were the intro to some old Saturday morning cartoon.) Given their fondness for the classic and the plastic, it's no surprise Gardens & Villa feel equally at home recording their album with piano-bar bard Richard Swift as touring with hipster hype magnets Foster the People. But if the ambiguous quality of their sound sometimes makes it hard to become emotionally invested in Gardens & Villa, in Lynch, they're blessed with a singer who has remarkable presence and poise. For all the effeminate intimations in his voice, he never uses it for pure affectation or gratuitous, histrionic effect. And though the band has been quick to cite the percussive funk of Talking Heads as a driving influence, they truly excel at crafting atmospheric ballads: the Low-like hymn ""Chemtrails"" and, especially, the foreboding ""Sunday Morning"", a rainy-day requiem that favorably recalls the retro-futurist psych-pop of the United States of America or Broadcast. It's hard to predict where Gardens & Villa might go from here: bombastic, drum-circle-ready closer ""Neon Dove"" carries the possibility of Yeasayer-styled transition from misfits to populists, while ""Orange Blossom"" suggests a desire to join Wild Beasts on the art-funk fringes. But in the flute-tootin' Lynch, they've got a pied piper worth following down whichever path he takes.","Mixing gothic mysticism and hazy dream pop, Gardens & Villa step out with a promising full-length debut.

Stranger Ballet,The Poison Control Center,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff49d034d5c69bf47c1/1:1/w_160/154f8baf.jpg,2011-07-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15608-stranger-ballet/,Afternoon,"Well before the release of 2010's sturdy, sprawling Sad Sour Future, Iowa rockers the Poison Control Center embarked on what they dubbed an endless tour. At press time, an end appears nowhere in sight. Along their way, the band carved out a little time to lay down their latest, Stranger Ballet. Half as long and nearly twice as lively as its predecessor, Stranger Ballet is bright, boisterous, and instantly appealing power-pop, jammed with the kind of immediacy you hope to put across when you've only got a half-hour or so to impress and the sort of smart, starchy hooks that hang with you long after they're over. Each member of the band's songwriting trio ups his own lyrical ante on Stranger Ballet. Patrick Tape Fleming's words are more charmingly sincere, fellow guitarist Devin Frank's are slacker and more impressionistic, and bassist Joseph Terry's are both sweeter and more surreal. Musically, though, their styles have grown far closer, perhaps a byproduct of all those months on the road flitting through the van iPod. Hints of spindly alt-rock touchstones from Built to Spill to pre-Maladroit Weezer bump heads with glam and late-90s indie spazz, but with much of Sad Sour Future's excess fat trimmed back, who PCC sound like seems far less important this time out than what they sound like. Here's a band that's enjoyed an enormous confidence boost over the past couple of years, and while there's still a kind of aw-shucks humility to the proceedings, the giddy effortlessness of these hooks suggest that these guys know precisely how good they've gotten. As on Sad Sour Future, there's nary a bad tune in the bunch, but I'll call Terry's gleefully manic ""Underground Bed"" the set's highest high-- like a Thermals song with the vitriol sucked right out. That's the other thing about these guys: Except for maybe Frank's sad sour missive about ""shit and piss"" on opener ""Torpedoes on Tuesday..."" and Fleming's weepy ""Born on Date"", there's never a second where the band's not having a blast making this racket. You can hear the smiles wide across their faces, and that feeling's catching. Even when soul belter Mona Perkins does an awkwardly ebullient ""Gimme Shelter"" routine on a couple of these tracks, the ill-suited pairing gets over on sheer jubilance. Nearly a decade deep into their career, you couldn't blame these guys for coming off a little ragged, especially after the exceedingly ambitious Sad Sour Future. But Stranger Ballet finds the PCC raring to go, eager to please, and enjoying every minute of the wild ride they've found themselves on.","The tirelessly touring Iowa indie rockers follow 2010's sprawiing Sad Sour Future with a sharper, more streamlined album.

Finally Famous,Big Sean,by: Sam Hockley-Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff09d034d5c69bf47bc/1:1/w_160/46ee4add.jpg,2011-07-06 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15605-finally-famous/,Def JamGOOD,"Rapping about the pressures of being famous is pretty popular right now. Kanye West and Drake, in their best moments, can make that weight feel like something that could apply to our jobs and relationships, and Big Sean's debut album on West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint takes a similar approach. The idea seems to be that with a deal and a record in stores, the Detroit MC has earned the right to complain with the best of them. While Finally Famous isn't especially nuanced, Sean is an often extremely entertaining rapper. He's able to fit his elastic, smooth voice in the cracks of No I.D.'s lush soul samples just as easily as he slides right over heavier, more radio-friendly tracks like ""Marvin & Chardonnay"", which features a verse from West. Sean often runs circles around beats, speeding up his voice so that his words cram into a pileup in the end. His appeal is more in the way he plays with language than in his lyrics, which go so far as to make an unfortunate ""Family Guy"" reference. On individual tracks, Sean's style works well. Even the blandest lyrics are worth a rewind based purely on delivery and enthusiasm. Who knew that ""Fuck, I hate to say I told you so/ So buying rounds is my way of saying I told you hos"" could sound so believably triumphant? But it's when the guests show up-- a high-profile list including not only West, but also The-Dream, Lupe Fiasco, Pharrell, John Legend, Wiz Khalifa, and Chris Brown-- Sean appears out of place on his own album. Clipse's Pusha T has a particularly strong verse on deluxe-edition album closer ""100 Keys"", while Sean sounds helium-light by comparison. Ultimately, Sean's a likable character. Still, a line on ""100 Keys"" encapsulates his faults: ""Keys open doors, but bricks open windows,"" he raps, recalling Clipse's ""Keys Open Doors"" except lacking their sharp wit and heavy delivery. We can only hope that for album two, Sean will step out from the herculean shadows of the artists he surrounds himself with and learn the art of subtlety.","The likable Detroit rapper's debut on Kanye West's G.O.O.D.

Pleasure,Pure X,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd0b1335d7bf1699fe9/1:1/w_160/5b9c0439.jpg,2011-07-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15575-pleasure/,Acéphale,"After a few scattered 7""s, Pure Ecstasy decided to up and change their name to Pure X for their debut full-length. But Pure X are hardly suffering from a personality crisis-- a San Francisco cover band already had the former handle copyrighted, so the abbreviation occurred out of necessity. For those of us who heard something special in loose, wandering tracks like 2009 B-side ""You're in It Now"" or ""Voices"" a year later, nearly everything on Pleasure will feel like a welcome distillation of the elements that made those songs sound promising. In turn, the band's new moniker should seem completely fitting: No longer just a kick-around project from three Austin dudes, Pure X have become the refined and elemental version of their former selves. Fans of those early singles don't need to worry too much. Pure X remain very much attached to their singular style. Jesse Jenkins' bass still sounds peanut-butter sticky, while Nate Grace's guitars showcase pond-ripple textures and Mideast-tinged tones one moment and hemorrhage syrupy feedback the next. Like grunge for beachcombers or shoegaze for people happy to be alive, Pleasure is all about texture and patience, stretched to ensure maximum zoneage. Anything MDMA-related about the moniker is a total misnomer-- this sounds like music made by people who mainline Benadryl. Sure, the album's blown-out guitars, dusky shoreline vibes, and drug-sick crawl can seem awfully familiar. But Pure X aren't just coasting on shaggy fumes. For one, this is a terrific-sounding record, built for headphones and high volume. Recorded live with no overdubs, everything emulsifies beatifically while a disorienting quality still looms, like riding in a four-door on the freeway with only the back left window down. Pure X also set themselves apart by both honoring their influences and recombining them in interesting ways. Opener ""Heavy Air"" sounds like a chopped 'n' screwed Real Estate, while the new version of ""Voices"" suggests My Bloody Valentine channeling the Everly Brothers. After all, these songs owe a lot to the starry-eyed romantic ballads of the late 1950s and early 60s. Instead of harnessing the rebel cool of that era, Pure X get lost in the simplicity and slow-burn daydreaminess, stoking these characteristics with uniquely visceral reverb and a zonked tunefulness that impart a vaporous sensuality. But the most defining and pleasurable thing about Pleasure is the guitars-- impressive for a record that doesn't care about show-off guitar shit at all. Grace lets his pedals do most of the talking, gracefully sussing out emotional detail with subtle melody while still creating memorable moments, like the cheap firework burnout at the end of ""Half Here"". Pure X may not be breaking new ground, but as far as deadbeat summer vibes done right go, Pleasure is one killer drag.","The name of this Austin trio has changed, but their delayed-gratification summer vibes have only become more refined and elemental on this welcome debut LP.

Electronic Dream,AraabMuzik,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc5b1335d7bf1699fd9/1:1/w_160/bfb7ddf5.jpg,2011-07-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/,Duke,"Alongside the roaring Harlem rapper Vado, Rhode Island native AraabMuzik has been one of the key figures in the re-emergence of Cam'ron, Dipset's language-bending figurehead. After a long period of complete disappearance, Cam's been going through something of a comeback lately, aided in large part by tracks like Araab's punishing ""Get It in Ohio"". Araab's work for Cam, and for other freelance clients, sounds dollar-store cheap but knife-edge tense; it reminds me of Steve Jablonsky's score for Friday the 13th. He makes ferocious, diamond-hard gangsta rap beats with a pervading sense of dystopic anxiety. Araab's sense of vision comes through even more strongly in the web videos he's been releasing, in which he shows off his MPC virtuosity and slices up samples of, oh, say, Cannibal Corpse. Like fellow underground rap visionaries Clams Casino and DJ Burn One, Araab makes freelance beats that hint at a fully developed personal aesthetic. And like those guys, he's now striking out on his own, making instrumental music that brings that aesthetic to the forefront. Electronic Dream is Araab's first commercially available album, but it works more like a collection of remixes. Rather than creating his own tracks from scratch, Araab spends his debut album dismembering a series of cheesed-out hairgel-house superclub anthems: DJ Nosferatu's ""The Underground Stream"" on ""Underground Stream"", Jam & Spoon's ""Right in the Night (Fall in Love With Music)"" on ""Golden Touch"", Starchaser's ""So High"" on ""Feelin So Hood"". This is, to put it mildly, an unexpected direction for Araab. With a little bit of Googling, you can find plenty of online screeds from fans frustrated or even enraged at Araab for making an album based on this music, or for dishonoring his sample sources by leaving large pieces of these tracks unchanged while neglecting to properly credit the original producers. But Araab's changes, relatively minor though they may be, turn a sound built on populist uplift into something darker. It's tough to imagine the tracks on Electronic Dream getting any play in any dance club in the world, and it's virtually impossible to picture anyone rapping over them. Instead, this album is a genre unto itself-- ominous future shit that creates an atmosphere but never bleeds into the background. Araab's snare-hits resonate like eye-punches, and his drum-programming is pure, unrelenting rap shit. But he's applying that sensibility to songs where the melodies shine even when Araab's using a screaming sound effect as part of the rhythm track. The end result is a truly weird little album-- something at once anxious and euphoric. As hard as his drums punch, though, Araab still let the textures of these anthems shine through. And in Araab's hands, these melodies work differently; the anonymous dance divas wailing ecstatically over their original beats become lost, lonely souls, anxiously whispering to themselves that everything will be OK. Araab's music doesn't allow for dizzy buildups and cathartic breakdowns; instead, it's all murky tension, all the time. At times, his tracks can sound a bit like the woozy bass music of L.A.'s Brainfeeder scene, but Araab is always more direct and more ferocious than those guys. And yet the sugary beauty of those melodies sound like they belong on his tracks; nothing is out of place. ""Got a feelin' so high,"" the singer on ""Feelin So Hood"" coos, and the drums beat that feeling down while the gorgeous ripples of synth lift it back up. There's something truly fascinating about the entire LP: An up-and-coming hardcore rap producer leaving his genre behind so that he can twist and scramble this hands-in-the-air big-room sound. And in peeling back its excesses and substituting in his own eccentricities, Araab uncovers a primal emotional force in this music, one that fits beautifully with his own air-raid siren aesthetic. Electronic Dream is pretty, but it's pretty like the morning sun twinkling off of a dangling machete blade-- you don't want to fuck with it.","Producer behind the recent reemergence of Dipset and Cam'ron strikes out on his own, making lush instrumentals with his own fully developed aesthetic.

Often seen outfitted in a luchador mask, Gonzales clearly has a flair for the theatrical, and his debut LP, Ceremony, strives for the cinematic. Rooted in drum'n'bass while touching on everything from 8-bit to dubstep to house, Gonzales aims to assault your senses with all the subtlety of a frying pan smack. But for all its range, Ceremony suffers from being brazenly repetitive, relying on flash instead of substance and betraying a lack of restraint. Tracks are build around deep bass, throbbing swaths of electronics, and errant sound effects, all of which are usually contrasted by a mercurial element, like say, a brief, semi-melodious synth line. The resulting tracks sadly feel too truncated for the dancefloor and too monotonous for headphones. Gonzales does have a solid feel for the role of percussion in his futuristic assemblages, such as the shakers and claps on the alien, evil ""Jaguar"" or the riotous cowbells on ""Fields"". And despite a lack of variance, Gonzales proves to be an interesting mimic at times, offering a slightly less-heady approximation of a Zomby track (""Fields""), and channeling a menace-dripping Massive Attack (""Restart""). The latter gets a boost from vocalist Sasha Perera, who finds herself in the esteemed company rapper Freddie Gibbs and folk-futurist Helado Negro, proving, if nothing else, that at least the guy has taste. But Gonzales' mishandling of those guest spots and the record's frankly obnoxious second half makes for a burdening listen. Gibbs tries to craft some semblance of a song out of the wonky bluster of ""Highway to Hell"", but the track is a non-starter. Everyone else is simply drowned out by the racket, making Gonzales' ""look at me"" aesthetic feel even more masturbatory. (For some reason, only rapper Nocando gets a pass for his appearance on ""Got Me Fucked Up"", a song so hilariously awful it demands to be mentioned here.) Despite the thoughtfulness bestowed upon the Helado Negro-assisted closing track, it's of little consequence-- the record's end is reward enough. So, lesson learned: No matter how deep the bass is, it can't mask how shallow most of the ideas are.","Ernest Gonzales' debut LP as Mexicans With Guns aims for the cinematic but lacks nuance and pacing.

The band takes its name from a dangerous spider whose venom can cause skin lesions, so the Fantastic Voyage-like concern with bodily systems here seems fitting. This focus is there even when the lyrics turn towards the surreal, as when frontman Tim Meskers sings on ""Wooden Fingers"" about ""dreams still trickling from my eyes."" The vague nature of dreams and memories pervades Evening Tapestry. The lyrical narration is often indirect and distant, recounting small, indelible details and visions both somnambulant (the surreal, cobweb-covered ""Statue Garden"") and conversational (""At Last"", which details a cab ride). The music itself takes on the form of creeping psychedelia, as organs sickly spin within baroque structures (the aptly titled ""Paisley Tears"") and even the simplest six-string jangle takes on a soft-focus blur. The overall approach owes something to the heyday of the Elephant 6 collective, though nothing on Evening Tapestry gets as far out as the Olivia Tremor Control's ""Green Typewriters"" suite. Brown Recluse's own sunshine-blotter dabblings are more reminiscent of early Beulah, or the surreal sensitivity on Of Montreal's 1999 opus The Gay Parade. You can feel what Meskers is saying, even if the surroundings seem a bit strange. With all the talk of paisley and psychedelia, it's important to note that Evening Tapestry is, first and foremost, an indie pop album (and one on the increasingly strong roster of resuscitated indie pop label Slumberland, no less). That means there's plenty of jangle and winsome melodical structures, recalling the dearly departed East Coast outfit Pants Yell! as much as the usual suspects: the Clientele, early Belle and Sebastian, indie-pop forebears the Zombies, and Brooklyn newcomers Beach Fossils. Unlike Beach Fossils' compartmentalized distance, though, Brown Recluse sound bright and direct throughout Evening Tapestry, like light shining through their sleepy fog. Sort of like a dream? No-- better.","The debut from this Philadelphia indie pop group owes a debt to the gentle psych-pop of the Elephant 6 collective.

Shangri-La,YACHT,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd69d034d5c69bf4799/1:1/w_160/87dd6c3b.jpg,2011-07-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15581-shangri-la/,DFA,"YACHT's second album as a duo, their fifth overall, fuses a utopian concept with the brand of nervy, spastic electro-funk we've come to expect from the DFA label. As on 2009's See Mystery Lights, Portland laptop maestro Jona Bechtolt (formerly of the Blow) and singer Claire L. Evans enjoy their smoothest sailing when they fully submit to sweaty euphoria; Shangri-La offers more than enough frantic beats, fidgety bass lines, spiky guitar leads, soaring piano riffs, delirious vocal harmonies, and, yes, cowbells to fit in on any house-party playlist. Still, its idyllic theme can be a bit heavy-handed, and nothing here is quite as indelibly hooky as past single ""Psychic City (Voodoo City)"". Shangri-La continues YACHT's trajectory from blips and bloops that suggest their computerized origins to a full-fledged band sound that should translate nicely to hedonistic live shows. But the duo's sense of, well, fun hasn't gone anywhere. See Mystery Lights' nods to T-Pain and Desmond Dekker gives way to an end-times synth workout ""Dystopia (The Earth Is on Fire)"", which shares a seven-minute video with the tropical-flavored disco-punk of album opener ""Utopia"". When the pace slows, as on the spacey ""Love in the Dark"", instant quotables jump out: ""I love you like a small-town cop/ Yeah, I wanna smash your face in with a rock,"" Evans sings, in deadpan multi-track. Still, the record tends to burden its good times with a few too many ideas that simply aren't that distinctive. Brass-boosted ""Holy Roller"", which starts as a finger-snapping cousin to Black Lips' religion-minded ""Veni Vidi Vici"" and ends closer to the doomed stomp of Modest Mouse's ""Fly Trapped in a Jar"" (by way of dubstep bass-wobble), recommends not worrying about a god. James Murphy-esque dance-rant ""Paradise Engineering"" finds holiness within. The basic gist-- and despite its familiarity, it's a commendable one-- is that, as Belinda Carlisle once sang, heaven is a place on Earth. ""If we build a utopia, will you come and stay?"" asks Shangri-La's closing, title track, all catchy la-la-las and beatific afterglow.

Galactic Melt,Com Truise,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afef13d197565213a38b/1:1/w_160/856c3c55.jpg,2011-07-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15604-galactic-melt/,Ghostly,"It hasn't even been five months since Ghostly re-released Com Truise's formative Cyanide Sisters EP, and already Princeton, N.J.'s Seth Haley is back with a full-length debut. That Galactic Melt has been pretty much in the can for that entire time tells you something about Haley's formidable work ethic; in addition to Truise, he operates under at least three other pseudonyms, none as fully-realized but each as prodigious. Haley's rapid-fire turnover plays incredibly well on the Internet. He's something of a cottage industry, dispensing original tracks, remixes, podcasts, and accompanying boxfresh graphic designs to his blog readership and Twitter followers with impressive regularity. By capitalizing on the immediacy of the formats, he's also charting his own evolution in realtime. When he writes, ""I thought I'd switch it up a little"" in reference to a remix he's just posted for Ana Lola Roman's ""Klutch"", he's acknowledging that his listeners know what he means by ""it,"" and how it's been switched; everything is laid out with a clear progression, one small evolution to the next. The comparative slow lane of a regular label release schedule, though, has a habit of slowing down the flow of music, crumpling up its timelines and deforming expectations. This usually doesn't matter to the end listener; what's new to our ears is good as new. But since Galactic Melt sounds more like a polite and brotherly companion piece to Cyanide Sisters than it does a proper follow-up, it's hard not to feel like the tactic of waiting to market has robbed Haley of some of some of his momentum. Part of the problem is Cyanide Sisters. As debut EPs go, it was an accomplished enough turn to raise questions about what Truise might do for an encore. The answer, as it happens, was, well, a slightly more muted version of the same. Don't get me wrong: with its staccato, bonus level synth stabs, keening psychedelia and 1980s-drenched drum sounds, Melt is still very identifiably Truise. But with the exception of the banging double whammy of ""VHS Sex"" and ""Cathode Girls"", there's nothing much here to suggest that Truise has upped his game in any meaningful way. Whether you consider that a disappointment will depend on how much mileage you get out of Haley in this mode.","Prolific Princeton, N.J., artist releases his debut full-length, which works as a polite companion to his Cyanide Sisters EP.

Drums Between the Bells,Brian EnoRick Holland,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe8b1335d7bf169a011/1:1/w_160/5d2304e8.jpg,2011-07-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15598-drums-between-the-bells/,Warp,"Who's your Brian Eno? The art-pop savant of Here Come the Warm Jets? The ambient theorist of Discreet Music? The prog-jazz dabbler of Nerve Net? Or the film music composer of Small Craft on a Milk Sea? Maybe you think of him mainly as a virtuoso technician, an innovative pop producer, a prodigious collaborator, or a visionary mixed-media artist. His broad range of talents and activities makes getting your head around his catalogue about as plausible as giving him a haircut, and it's natural for us to establish our own versions of what his baseline aesthetic is. Whoever the ""real"" Eno is to you, he's bound to show up at least once on his second LP for Warp Records, a mercilessly erratic collaboration with the poet Rick Holland. You could say with only slight hyperbole that Eno's signing to Warp last year was like the Beatles joining Elephant 6. The British label's eclectic roster-- Broadcast's cerebral electronic pop, Autechre's ascetic IDM, Boards of Canada's synthetic naturalism, Aphex Twin's ambient techno-- could reasonably be called the Eno Diaspora. Small Craft, a collaboration with Leo Abrahams and Jon Hopkins, was oriented around music composed for (and rejected from) Peter Jackson's film The Lovely Bones, but with its jungle breakbeats, ambient drones, and computer glitches, it sounded like Eno refracting Warp's own history. In other words: Eno making music influenced by Eno. Drums Between the Bells retains many qualities of Small Craft, including propeller-like live percussion and mildly dated whiffs of trip-hop and downtempo. The big difference is that the music is built around Holland's words, read by a number of different speakers. As it doesn't rely on the ironic voice and language games of modern fashion, Holland's richly imagistic poetry is well-suited to the project. The music around it is scattershot, but not random: Each song is designed to complement the poem at its center. Still, the record has a rather unnerving pace, overpowering and retiring in quick alternation. ""Bless this Space"" opens things inauspiciously with an electronic jazz fusion setting, which is about the most unsympathetic environment for a poet imaginable. ""Glitch"" is musically livelier, with a mightily abrasive climax, but the HAL-like vocal treatment flattens Holland's poem into numbingly literal sci-fi boilerplate. Then, abruptly, a suite of meltingly lovely tracks arrives and does real service to Holland's poetry. The arctic pianos that encircle a crisp female voice on ""Dreambirds"" recall Eno's prior work with Harold Budd, just as the liquid guitar of ""Pour It Out"" recalls the lighter side of the Fripp collaborations. Despite its dystopian tendencies, Holland's writing has a plain-hearted tenderness that female voices seem to draw out more subtly than male ones. On these two tracks, as well as ""Seedpods"" and ""The Real"", Eno reacts to the female voice with great sensitivity. The result is like a gentler companion to Laurie Anderson's Homeland: no ironclad beats hammering down on the words, but a gossamer web cradling them with all due reverence. The oracular hush fits Holland much better than stentorian force. Even when Drums dips into sketchy territory-- the reggae-styled ""Dow"", for example-- it's hard not to be intrigued by Eno's command of sonic texture, weight, and spatial dimensions. Nothing feels vaguely formed. With the ability to realize microscopically precise details and effects, he makes the reconciliation of extremes feel inevitable: A river of industrial slag might flow into saucy jazz horns; funk riffs might level out into a thick krautrock haze. We can count on these kinds of pleasures even from a so-so Eno record, and Drums is better than so-so. The problem with it, beyond a handful of unflattering genre excursions, is a slight but persistent thinness of imagination. The concrete music of ""Fierce Aisles of Light"" conjures the feel of being on a train with impeccable accuracy, but it's a pat setting for lyrics where trains feature prominently. When a minute of silence, called ""Silence"", appears near the end of the record, it's hard not to feel as though you're in the presence of an incredible talent casting about for the next big idea, casually producing minor wonders in the meantime.","On his latest album for Warp, the legendary sonic architect teams with poet Rick Holland for an inconsistent but occasionally brilliant set.

Alchemic Heart,Vampillia,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe59d034d5c69bf47af/1:1/w_160/a316f539.jpg,2011-07-01 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15594-alchemic-heart/,Important,"Your pretentiousness meter should admittedly be swinging toward the far right. Alchemic Heart is the first readily available stateside release from Vampillia, an Osaka, Japan-based 11-piece that features several vocalists, violinists, and guitarists, plus piano, turntables, and bass. As if the band name weren't laughable enough, they also call themselves a ""brutal orchestra,"" and that's still just the start. ""Sea"", the first of the album's dual 24-minute tracks, features former Swans vocalist Jarboe intoning words of wisdom about inhaling darkness and exhaling light and peace. Alchemic Heart's second side, predictably called ""Land"", features Japanese noise lord Merzbow. Both guests have added their names to ham-handed collaborations in the past. With Godspeed You! Black Emperor again on the road, how many ensembles with sociopolitical messages and half-hour attention spans do we really need? We at least need Vampillia, especially here. Somehow, the band avoids nearly all of its potential pitfalls, navigating both of these marathons with agility and strength. ""Sea"" is at first an exercise in delicacy and restraint, the massive ensemble building slowly through the sort of deep instrumental breaths recognizable from Bang on a Can's interpretation of Brian Eno's Music For Airports. The additional layers come steadily, with a harmonic electric guitar riff sliding between the orchestra's ebbs and light percussion serving only to make each of those movements more encompassing. Jarboe's steely whisper sits inside the music, demanding attention without stealing it. The first nine minutes or so generate tension, while the last 14 are a slow, menacing release. Assisted by Brooklyn noise outfit Inswarm, Vampillia writhe through a wall of sound, with violins trilling, guitars grinding, and voices bending and clipping. It's as if the orchestra is trying to recreate the static and squall of early black metal-- simply stretched and compressed to sound even more malevolent. Jarboe is eventually left in sudden silence, repeating her mantras with resolve. The conclusion, like the track itself, is melodramatic, but it feels warranted, its impact real. Despite a similar length, exploration of peak noise, and quiet dénouement, ""Land"" takes a much different approach from one point to another. The graceful cycles of the strings on the first piece are swapped for stunted, staggered phrases here, made even more disorienting by Merzbow's bursts of alien noise. ""Land"" is almost immediately loud, each layer occasionally syncing into enormous swells of sound. Again, though, Vampillia quiet down as the track nears its 10-minute mark, with little pockets of Keith Jarrett-like piano splashing through an electronic haze. ""Land"" takes its time to rebuild, but when it does, the sound suggests that these dozen or so musicians are trying to control chaos. Merzbow's shards of electricity don't overrun the orchestra; instead, he pulls them forward, making the violins more dramatic and each changing piano chord more momentous. The music hits its crest with about four minutes left, and the sound is infernal. Voices and strings and electronic bursts collide constantly. It's terrifying, exhilarating, and intricate. This sort of music is easy to get wrong, to make too maudlin or too context-dependent. From the hit-and-miss guests to the ambitious two-tracks, two-sides format, Vampillia have a lot stacked against them on Alchemic Heart. Both of these pieces demand and deliver, though, using high drama to lubricate urgent compositions.","The Japanese 11-piece's first readily available release consists of two dramatic 24-minute tracks, featuring ex-Swans singer Jarboe and noise lord Merzbow.

Me Doing Standup,Norm Macdonald,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdcc0084474cd0c1b53/1:1/w_160/f9e1e7cb.jpg,2011-07-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15587-me-doing-standup/,Comedy Central,"Me Doing Standup is a perfect title for a Norm Macdonald's new album in the same way T.I.'s Fuck a Mixtape was: Both concede the nonchalance of their creators and acknowledge that artists at their level have better things to do. But while free mixtapes can boost the profile of a rapper at any level without earning a legit dime, comedy records are at best peripheral income streams for their headliners and useless for most everyone else. But this release makes sense for Norm Macdonald. While he's managed to be at least on the periphery of cultural awareness over the past two decades on screens both big and small-- ""Saturday Night Live""'s Weekend Update, the cult classic Dirty Work, and the recently canceled ""Sports Show with Norm Macdonald""-- none of it involves him telling jokes on stage for 40 straight minutes. Not even 2006's album Ridiculous, which mostly compiled skits done with his famous friends. But if you liked him in any of those guises, Me Doing Standup is pretty much foolproof, a likable set from a guy who's basically never had to break character in his entire career. Macdonald's delivery has a certain expressive deadpan to it, a slack-sounding outsider cadence that's quietly insightful and insidiously hilarious. He imparts meaning through small gestures and inflection such as a homespun pronunciation of ""pillow,"" or an eyebrow raise at his own recognition of the word ""defibrillator."" And Standup might be one of the few comedy records you'll hear that's quite literally timeless. There isn't one instance where Macdonald gives an indication of what year it is. Even stranger is how absorbing it can be even though Norm Macdonald, the human being, is all but removed from the proceedings. I can't think of a comedy album that's less beholden to the life of the actual person who made it. That his own father died from a heart attack comes off as a small asterisk to the larger point of how our own bodies are the terrorists most likely to end our lives (""He wasn't expecting it, he was looking for fuckin' Arabs and shit""), and he only pledges political allegiance to officials who can eliminate death by their second term. Indeed, though softened by his affability and implicit self-deprecation, Me Doing Standup is almost entirely obsessed with mortality, even if cancer, heart attacks, murder, and alcoholism are namedropped with the gravity comedy usually grants to consumer products. It comes nowhere near the high-wire truth-telling of Louis C.K., nor does it really attempt to push any sort of measure of taste. Macdonald acknowledges his existence as absurd to the point where even he hardly takes it seriously. Within the first couple of minutes, he pledges ""that's my goal in life-- is not to die"" even though he ""come[s] from a long line of death."" Ultimately, Me Doing Standup really does end up honoring its title's definitiveness, as it's something like the quintessential Norm Macdonald set: occasionally indulgent, frequently hilarious, and always managing to make this strange guy come off as likeable everyman.","The death-obsessed everyman's comedy LP is typically indulgent and frequently hilarious.

100% Publishing,Wiley,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe6b1335d7bf169a009/1:1/w_160/aeadea33.jpg,2011-07-01 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15595-100-publishing/,Big Dada,"The last time grime godfather Wiley put out an album on Big Dada, 2007's Playtime Is Over, he was dropping vague hints about the release being his last solo record. Then ""Wearing My Rolex"" blew up. Everything since has been a jumble of pop moves, renunciations of said pop moves, double-reverse crossovers, beefs, mixtapes, label changes, and that one time last year the UK rapper/producer just up and released eleven zip files of unreleased beats for free. But Wiley also found the time to put together a completely self-contained, no-interference album, give it the autonomy-flaunting title 100% Publishing, and get Big Dada to distribute it. It's almost like he just wanted to pick up where he left off before his chart bid. Wiley's latest succeeds admirably as a figurative reset button, even as it's run through with the embattled energy and strident confidence of a creator intent on rejecting the sellout accusations that forced a stylistic reboot in the first place. 100% Publishing bristles with the reflexive jabs and on-the-spot opinions that tend to come during long-distance sparring sessions with the nebulous @-flogging masses. The single-minded focus on wrangling a complicated commercial-vs.-underground reputation can feel exhausting at times, but the album's musicality makes up for it, with an improved vocal delivery and a collection of beats that expand on what drew attention to Wiley's production at grime's onset. ""Some days I'm asking God, but then the Internet is quicker,"" Wiley says on opener ""Information Age"". The album's distinctly online-borne attitude leads to a lot of defensive boasts. The title track reasserts Wiley's original DIY success story, and ""Your Intuition"" makes admitting past diversions and future changes into a sign of strength, while ""Wise Man and His Words"" stands up for the rapper's ""dual core"" fanbase. Hints of frustration still bubble under the surface; ""One Hit Wonder"" and ""Yonge Street (1,178 Miles Long)"" thrive on the tension between braggadocio and insecurity. But the main mood is one of defiant optimism. Single ""Numbers in Action"" says it best: ""I reinvent, I'm like a brand new signing."" Musically, the title track and ""One Hit Wonder"" boost Wiley's vintage ""eskibeat"" style with busier melodies and suppler drums. The stripped-down boom-clap beats for ""Numbers in Action"" and ""Yonge Street"" nod toward retro-modern club rap without all the Eurobeat bombast. Even the more unusual flourishes-- the having-a-larf circus melody of ""Boom Boom Da Na"", or the melancholy piano line of ""Wise Man and His Words""-- have dead-serious rhythmic pulses beneath them. Chirpy shuffle-step love track ""Pink Lady"" and instrospective, R&B-tinged ""Talk About Life"" seem like they'd work better in the context of ""rhythm & grime"" project Chill Out Zone, but these pop-oriented cuts are the exceptions. 100% Publishing benefits from a deeper focus on the other side of the boards, too. Wiley wasn't always the slickest-flowing rapper, but if there's one part of his game that's really stepped up, it's his relationship with his own beats. He's so locked in that even his playful lyrical moments (""Make a silly move, career-ending/ I'm an Avatar when I'm Airbending"") stand up to the bass the voice nimbly ricochets off. It might be hasty to applaud a return to form for an artist who's spent the past few years coming to terms with what that form's supposed to even mean. But it's still great to hear what Wiley can do when left to his own devices.","Created outside any sort of label system, the UK grime godfather's latest is his first album distributed by Big Dada since 2007's Playtime Is Over.

The Unanimous Hour,Lungfish,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe05e6ef95969321e9a/1:1/w_160/1d9fb6c8.jpg,2011-07-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15592-the-unanimous-hour/,Dischord,"They say it takes only three chords to write a punk song. Lungfish did it with two. And they did it for 18 years. From 1987 to 2005, the Baltimore quartet could be considered the world's leading purveyor of punk-rock-as-devotional-art. They were a band hellbent and single-minded in their commitment to ascetic thrashing, with an amply bearded and tattooed frontman who came off like underground music's answer to John the Baptist. For all that, Lungfish's music sounds immediately familiar. It's just a handful of cyclical guitar riffs and pulsing, sea-shanty rhythms played in steady repetition. ""A person doesn't have to be Lungfish-literate to know how to hear our music,"" singer Daniel Higgs told the Baltimore City Paper in 1998, during one of the band's only extensive interviews. ""If you've never heard the song before, after several seconds you have heard the song, and it's gonna do that for a few more minutes."" Like the best punk bands, Lungfish used common tools, but created singular music through sheer force of personality. Totaling 11 albums, Lungfish's catalog can be intimidating, but 1999's The Unanimous Hour is a good place to start. Recently remastered and repressed by Dischord, Lungfish's long-out-of-print eighth record is among the band's sturdiest statements. On first listen, it sounds a lot like any other Lungfish record: Two or three chords repeat ad infinitum while Higgs belts out apocalyptic psychobabble. But this record has a special place in the Lungfish discography. It's a pivot point between the band's early years and the laser-guided minimalist riffage that would predominate its final three records. Even before the Internet sped up underground music's turnover rate, Lungfish's evolutionary pace was unthinkably glacial. This is one band that never hired a string section, bought a drum machine, or contemplated a sudden creative left turn. Each record shed a few more superfluous notes, reducing the music to its barest, heaviest essence. Early on, Lungfish tempered their sound with some basic concessions to pop music-- verses and choruses, mainly (""Friend to Friend in the Endtime"", from 1992's Talking Songs For Walking, was hooky enough that it eventually wormed its way into Joan Jett's setlist). But Lungfish spent the subsequent years streamlining their approach. By the time of The Unanimous Hour, the group had jettisoned conventional song structures in favor of unflagging hypnotic grooves. Opener ""Space Orgy"" barely budges from a single chugging chord that ping-pongs back and forth between guitarist Asa Osborne and bassist Nathan Bell. ""Mated"" thunders along on an unceasing two-note bass line. ""Vulgar Theories"" pushes a single fuzz-drenched riff far enough to stare down the most fully zonked Spacemen 3 tune. The Unanimous Hour also finds Higgs shifting gears as a vocalist. He further ditches the pretense of linear narrative, embraces hymn-like forms, and makes his words as repetitive as Osborne's riffs. The record holds some of Higgs' most subdued moments (the prayerful chant on ""God's Will"") as well as his most far-out (the hissed lyric about a mirrored, ringing urethra-sprout on ""Metatron""). Epic album closer ""Hallucinatorium"" splits the difference between these two extremes, with parallel lines of prose detailing a family portrait that could have been snatched from a Max Ernst sketchbook. ""Hallucinatorium"" was initially put to tape as a short-winded instrumental, but upon hearing it, Higgs felt inclined to lay down a few verses. The problem: The original recording was too short to accommodate all the ribcages, hexagon faces, and living prayers the singer hoped to mention. Dischord co-founder and Fugazi frontman Ian MacKaye, who guided the recording sessions, suggested simply slowing the tape down in order to buy a few extra minutes-- an idea he cribbed from hearing the Prince Far I song ""Survival"" played back-to-back with its pitched-down instrumental ""version."" So instead of picking up steam, the song tumbles into a dubby dream-world. Against the screwed-down sounds, Higgs' lyrics become deeper and heavier in their resonance. During the group's 90s heyday, Lungfish were unfairly lumped in with the emo and hardcore scenes, mostly because their music came out on Dischord. A decade removed from that context, Lungfish records seem more in line with weirdo luminaries like 13th Floor Elevators or contemporary mystic-metal heads like Om. Punk's basic impulse is fairly concrete, while Lungfish's inspiration is strictly otherworldly. The means of transmission, though, remains simple. On The Unanimous Hour, Lungfish use it to blast their message onward and outward into oblivion.","Remastered and reissued by Dischord, the Baltimore post-hardcore band's long-out-of-print eighth record is a good entry point to its singular catalog.

"Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away EP",Statik SelektahFreddie Gibbs,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afeaea9e61561daa652b/1:1/w_160/3b725c75.jpg,2011-07-01 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15599-lord-giveth-lord-taketh-away-ep/,CTEShowoff,"As a rapper, Freddie Gibbs remains locked in fifth gear at all times. He never significantly alters his rap style, but that style is such a hyper-technical, gangsta-rap blur that he always sounds impressive, no matter the context. Peers of mine have already written off Gibbs, claiming that it's a problem when he goes in the exact same way every time. I can see what they're saying, but that perpetual sturdiness is, for me, more a strength than a weakness. He just doesn't fuck up, ever. Gibbs recently signed with Young Jeezy's Corporate Thugz label, and that's an awkward pairing on paper. But as it turns out, the two Gibbs collabs on Jeezy's new The Real Is Back mixtape are the two most exciting tracks on the whole tape; without switching up his style at all, Gibbs sounds awesome over the lurching gothic evilness that Jeezy favors. Just by doing what he does, Gibbs fits into Jeezy's universe a lot more naturally than any of Rick Ross' recent Internet-rap protégés sound on the newish Maybach Music Group compilation. For the Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away EP, Gibbs dips a toe into a scene far removed from Jeezy's populist drug-rap, teaming up with DJ and producer Statik Selektah, a pillar of East Coast traditionalist circles and an underrated beatmaker. The two recorded the entire EP in a single day, broadcasting the sessions on Ustream and selling the finished project a couple of days later. It's a quickie EP, just 19 minutes long, and almost every track has a guest appearance or two. But beyond its length, there's little indication that Gibbs cranked this thing out as fast as possible. Every once in a while, there's an awkwardly cryptic line that could've used a rewrite (""I just wanna make dough and fuck bitches like I'm a Latter Day Saint""?), but Gibbs maintains the same quick-moving tough-talk intensity that he's always displayed. If you're not sick of just hearing this guy rap-- and you probably shouldn't be-- there's a lot to like about this one. Granted, nothing on Lord Giveth has the knife-edge intensity of a great Gibbs track like ""Murda on My Mind"", and Gibbs doesn't try out anything beyond his most well-traveled subject matter. But he still has a way with an evocative image (""Man, it's so dry out here niggas be cutting they dope with vitamins""), and his syllable-by-syllable flow remains a force of nature. Statik's tracks work as pretty good facsimiles of the classically simple DJ Premier style, and Gibbs sounds just as comfortable on those as he does on Jeezy tracks. (I get the impression that nothing disturbs this guy; he could probably rap over, like, a Deerhoof song without blinking.) Many of the album's guests come from Statik's usual circle of collaborators, gifted but grumpy East Coast guys like Termanology and Reks (the latter of whom airs out hopes ""for real MCs to kill the likes of Lil Bs,"" which should give you some idea what cultural milieu we're working in). Gibbs sounds coolest alongside guys from other regions, like Houston mainstay Trae, whose muttery nihilistic fast-rap baritone is similar to Gibbs' own, or Dogg Pound veteran Daz, who comes off badass even when he's rotely reciting his career accomplishments. But even the East Coast also-rans have their moments. I especially liked Push! Montana's extended ""Home Improvement"" riff: ""I'm Tim Taylor with the tool, man/ Play Wilson, try to peek over the gate/ Soon as I see your brow, I squeeze it in your face."" That clever ignorance is a small pleasure, like most of the pleasures on Lord Giveth. But even if it's nowhere near his strongest release, Lord Giveth remains a solid showcase for one of our most solid rappers.","Freddie Gibbs teams up with East Coast producer Statik Selektah to record an EP in a single day.

Though the former American Analog Set leader has since played about 150 shows with a standard bass-drums-guitar quartet, he again handles all the instruments himself on the second Wooden Birds record, conceived after a relocation from Brooklyn to Austin. Kenny even still taps the drums out on the body of his acoustic guitar. More important than Two Matchsticks' simplicity, though, are its songs, lessons of life and love conveyed in clear, unadorned language. Kenny eases the songs out as parables, meant for consideration at length. Over a plain click-clack rhythm and sharp acoustic strums, ""Criminals Win"" tells how sometimes bad things happen to good people; lovers quarrel when they should be kissing, honest people work when they should be living, and bad guys win when they should be falling. ""Too Pretty to Say Please"" is a series of desperate observations on a lover who's never content with her counterpart; its spartan sonic set-up affords a certain freshness to Kenny's laments, as though he were too busy considering romantic wounds to write orchestra charts or to fuss over guitar tone. Indeed, time and again during Two Matchsticks, Kenny plays the part of the tour guide who's been here before: He's seen the co-dependence of the title track, the desolation of ""Cross My Heart"", and the leap-of-faith moment of ""Struck by Lightning"". At his best, Kenny is relaxed, direct, and relatable, sounding more empathetic than didactic. Kenny isn't entirely without collaborators on Two Matchsticks. The sweet croon of Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard adds an appropriate measure of redemption to ""Warm to the Blade"", a song about pushing past heartbreak and finding new meaning. Matt Pond PA's Matt Pond, who plays guitar and sings in the band's live iteration, duets with Kenny on ""Be No Lie"", turning the steely-eyed lament into the sort of romantic warning that would have fit on Elliott Smith's XO. And former American Analog Set guest vocalist Leslie Sisson, another onstage guitarist/singer for the Wooden Birds, takes the lead on ""Baby Jeans"", a charming take on a high-school crush. Patient, generous, and smart, the song proves that while Kenny does well to maintain the Wooden Birds' solitary core, he does well to expand it occasionally, too.","Former American Analog Set leader Andrew Kenny turns in a second solo set of clear, unadorned lessons about life and love.

Though bleak electronic music and live albums don't necessarily make good bedfellows, Tearist manage fairly well, mostly because singer Yasmine Kittles and beatmaker William Strangeland-Menchaca know how to work a stage. Listen closely and you can hear them swapping out gear, evolving their set-up, and refining their schtick. You can also hear the truth: These weren't big-time shows. Tearist have recently grown buzzy enough to warrant their own L.A. Weekly profile, but there were a few lonely rooms along the way. Some songs are followed by heavy applause, but sometimes Tearist's final notes give way to mannered clapping. Other tracks ring with the hollow and boomy sound of empty rooms. ""There's only one person here, that's so weird,"" Kittles says at one point. Like their cityfolk Abe Vigoda, Tearist are devout students of 1980s goth and industrial sounds, but they've taken that moody, studio-driven music and retrofit it for basement shows and DIY spaces. On songs like ""Civilization"" and ""Closest"", Strangeland-Menchaca pushes his electronic rhythms up to punk tempos, but keeps his basslines dry and squelchy. Tearist don't really do hooks, though. Strangeland-Menchaca plays Martin Rev to Kittles' Alan Vega, blasting sparse and repetitive beats while the vocalist rants, writhes, and yowls animalistic grunts through a delay pedal. In other words, he lays down a steady foundation while she provides the dynamic. A live video of ""Civilization"" taped at KXLU provides a better picture of the band in performance. Strangeland-Menchaca hangs coolly in the background as Kittles works herself into a heavy froth, going all Einstürzende Neubauten on a piece of scrap metal. In other words, Living really provides only half of Tearist's show: the stuff you can hear. And the stuff that you can hear on Living is fairly obscure.","Devout students of 1980s goth and industrial, the attention-getting L.A. duo strings together a hodge-podge of live takes on its first full-length release.

Lights Out,Kate Simko,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd2c0084474cd0c1b41/1:1/w_160/30037071.jpg,2011-06-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15577-lights-out/,Hello?Repeat,"Lights Out is Kate Simko's debut album, but it comes more than 10 years into her career as a DJ and recording artist. Simko was classically trained on the piano as a child growing up in Chicago, but the music that caught her ear was coming out of the city's vibrant electronic music scene. Fascinated with the sounds she was hearing from Chicago house and IDM producers, she got herself some turntables and set to the task of learning to make this music herself. The music has since taken her to Chile, where she was half of the duo Detalles with Andres Bucci; back to Chicago, where she released a handful of singles and EPs, as well as the mostly ambient score for The Atom Smashers; and then to Buenos Aires, where Lights Out was born over the course of a year. Simko may have conceived the album thousands of miles to the south, but her formative Chicago house influence is certainly audible. The music is built firmly on a foundation of straight-ahead Roland beats-- nothing we haven't heard before, to be sure, but Simko has her own, often-engaging way of treating them once they're in place. Among her signatures is the way she wraps her basslines around the monolithic pulse of the kick drum. She keeps the bass tone as clean and shiny as new chrome and has a weirdly graceful way of integrating it-- it's like watching a cat sit down and slowly curl its tail around its front paws. This process is very easy to hear, because otherwise, Simko approaches her work with a minimalist's sense of space and patience, letting her club beats become mantras before introducing small changes. For instance, she waits until nearly halfway through ""Beneath"" to introduce a new chord change, but when she does, it instantly brightens the music. On vocal tracks ""Mind on You"", ""Had It All"", and ""Flight Into BA"", she uses her guest singers in much the same way she uses the rounded synth tones she's created, dropping them in at intervals as a way of evolving the music. ""Mind on You"", in particular, has a jazzy slide that the vocals almost get lost in. The one place where Simko works with messier sounds is ""Mira Vos"", which is invaded by strange synths that sound like doves cooing. All this adds up to an album that's strangely absorbing when you put it on in the background, but perhaps a little blank when you're paying close attention. You have to be in a mindset for minimalism when you listen to it, just as you would with Terry Riley or Philip Glass. If Lights Out has a failing as an album for home listening, it's a run of three tracks that each stretch past seven minutes. These three songs (""Cairo"", ""Bikini Atoll"", and ""Last Breath"") push the overall running time past an hour and simply aren't that interesting outside of a club context. You can hear how they might work in a dark room full of people who are there to dance, but they push the minimalist angle a little too far for passive listening. Outside of that, Lights Out is a solid debut, albeit one that will appeal primarily to listeners well within the core dance music audience.","More than a decade into her career, this Chicago-reared DJ and recording artist shows her formative house influence on a debut born in Buenos Aires.

Exmilitary,Death Grips,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd95e6ef95969321e8b/1:1/w_160/a208bec4.jpg,2011-06-30 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15583-exmilitary/,Third Worlds,"Energy without insight is monotonous. Insight without humor is preachy. Humor without frustration is toothless. Frustration without humanity is destructive. And humanity without energy is defeatist. If an album operates with the purpose of being a big noisy fuck-shit-up machine, missing just one of those elements can leave you with an overbearing mess, where every speaker-rattling burst of noise or cathartically screamed hook turns you back instead of getting you all riled up. Sacramento punk-rap outfit Death Grips are known for starting frothing mosh pits with a style that seems in keeping with the hardcore-meets-hip-hop confluence that first ran through skate culture a few decades back. Exmilitary, their free mixtape, is a bludgeoning slab of hostility that plays like both sides of a circa-1987 Cro-Mags b/w Just-Ice home tape bleeding through each other. Exmilitary avoids any of the flaws outlined above, but it's still a potentially alienating album: unnerving when you're not on its aggro wavelength, inviting when you are, and transfixing either way, thanks to the aggregate work of Death Grips' core. The raspy, deliberate MC Ride doesn't so much flow as bellow. Producer/videographer Flatlander and co-producer Info Warrior hit both sides of the audio-visual equation with overloaded noise (check the ""Guillotine"" video for starters). Additional vocalist Mexican Girl skulks in the background and spits venom for occasional effective emphasis. And Zach Hill, the Hella drummer-- recently heard on Marnie Stern's self-titled album-- provides some of the live percussion elements. But isolating each member's specific contributions seems like a good way to make an overwhelming sound seem flimsier than it really is. That said, MC Ride might be the most upfront element. His tendency to go hard in the rawest way possible with doomsayer verses has slotted him in a strange no-man's land between Southern and avant-rap. His tangled, diabolical lyrics are wrapped up in lust, drug panic, metaphysical power-tripping, and political agitation, and he delivers them as if every syllable were an exclamation point. And while there's not a ton of nuance, there's a surprising versatility, as Ride's rhymes range from malevolent to anxious to smart-assed. Monolithic and harsh, his voice sounds powerful doubling up the beats to the point where it doesn't even seem like a problem when it's halfway buried in the mix. The production does its damnedest to capture punk aggression for a hip-hop context without pushing things too far in either direction. Fuck-the-cops anthem ""Klink"" invokes Black Flag's ""Rise Above"", the opening scream from Bad Brains' ""Supertouch/Shitfit"" punctuates ""Takyon (Death Yon)"", and the beat to ""Spread Eagle Cross the Block"" is built sturdily around Link Wray's ""Rumble"". On sex-maniac anthem ""I Want It I Need It (Death Heated)"", a devastating hijack of Pink Floyd's ""Interstellar Overdrive"" perfectly conjures up this music's intersection of choppy, riff-heavy beat assault and psychedelic sprawl. Juke-inflected bangers like ""Thru the Walls"" and ""Blood Creepin"" blur Exmilitary's stylistic lines, and that's good-- it means not having to worry about scene purity or crossover potential, and focusing instead on just how much ferocity you can take.","With drumming by Zach Hill (Hella, Marnie Stern), the Sacramento punk-rap outfit offers a bludgeoning slab of hostility on its free mixtape.

Weekend at Burnie's,Curren$y,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe213d197565213a36d/1:1/w_160/70b223ab.jpg,2011-06-30 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15591-weekend-at-burnies/,Warner Bros.,"It's easy to characterize Curren$y as a weed-rapper and nothing but-- Wiz Khalifa's sticky-mouthed country cousin, say, or a younger Devin the Dude with no singing voice and little sense of vulnerability. And it's true that Curren$y raps more about getting high than most people do, and that his fluid, heavy-lidded drawl does a better job evoking the experience. But Curren$y's become an interesting figure with a lot going on, and to focus on his cannabis appetite is to ignore some of the things that make him one of the more dependable working rappers. For one thing, he's become a workhorse. In the past year, he's put out four ridiculously solid solo releases-- and that's not counting his kinda-sucky Return to the Winner's Circle mixtape, his crew's Jet Life to the Next Life mixtape, or his scores of guest appearances on other people's tracks. Those four solid releases paint a picture of a musical adventurer, a guy who tests himself against a new style of production whenever he gets bored. On last year's two Pilot Talk albums, Curren$y made his way through producer Ski Beatz' lush shag-carpet psychedelic soul, a luxurious retro sound. Then, a couple of months ago, he released the free Alchemist-produced Covert Coup EP, which gave him a chance to navigate Alc's tense, broken boom-bap-- a dizzy, refracted take on classic New York rap. Compared to those other records, the sound on Weekend at Burnie's is remarkably warm and approachable, and it brings Curren$y closer to the sound of current radio-rap than he's been in a while-- though, of course, he's still a long way from any serious rotation. For this one, he links up with producer Monsta Beatz, whose diffuse, melodic synths sound like a low-key version of the smoothly emotive style that's helped turn Drake and Wiz Khalifa into stars. The music on Weekend at Burnie's drifts by in an exceedingly pleasant haze. Now, Weekend at Burnie's won't turn Curren$y into anyone's idea of a star. His idea of a chorus is still something like this: ""Get paid, get paid my nigga, get [long pause] paaaid."" And his rap style doesn't employ the sort of attention-grabbing punchlines that leap through club speakers to grab you. Instead, his delivery is more an unhurried run-on that hits various ideas and images along the way without pounding any of them home. Though the music on his albums has changed, his slippery delivery really hasn't, and it's remarkable how completely at home he sounds on just about any form of beat that he attempts. So maybe the best thing about Weekend at Burnie's is the way these unassuming Monsta Beatz tracks give him room to operate. You can hear the man better on this album than you can on many of his recent efforts. And that gives us plenty of room to admire his slick little turns of phrase. A line like this one deserves to be heard: ""Haters tryna deplete my shine like venetian blinds/ But son do what the sun do: rise."" In terms of subject matter, Burnie's doesn't exactly push Curren$y outside of his comfort zone. You never get the impression that much is at stake for Curren$y, even if this is his first commercial release since signing his new Warner Bros. deal. Protégés Trademark and Young Roddy both get plenty of mic time; beyond a single too-brief Fiend verse, they're the album's only guests. We never get to hear Curren$y expressing any sort of drive or urgency or emotion; he's always happy to rhyme ""ease"" with ""breeze."" ""She Don't Want a Man"" is a fairly thin relationship-based story-rap that succeeds mostly because of a smeary cinematic keyboard sound that reminds me of Mario Winans' ""I Don't Want to Know"". But Curren$y's a rapper so sharp and confident that he never needs to leave his comfort zone, and it's a lot of fun to hear him flexing his style on a sunnier sound palette. On ""JLC"", near the end of the album, Curren$y indulges in a bit of paranoiac drug-dealer talk: ""Through text message, we plot the takeover/ Can't talk out loud 'round these chauffeurs/ Way on the outskirts of town, we have slick meetings/ Lookin' over our shoulders-- muhfuckin' lip readers."" I have no idea if any of this comes from Curren$y's personal experience or if he's just spinning yarns, but it's a packed-tight bit of writing, and he sounds unflappable as ever delivering it. In a moment like that, where you hear a guy deliver those dense lines so nonchalantly, you know you're in secure hands. Weekend at Burnie's, like so many other recent Curren$y releases, is full of those moments. This guy is still on a very serious roll, and it doesn't seem to be anywhere near over.","The absurdly prolific and consistent rapper returns with a major label record and more songs about weed and everyday life.

"Alice, Agatha, Branch & Christ",Witch Gardens,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af729d034d5c69bf46ff/1:1/w_160/fab30af4.jpg,2011-06-29 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15495-alice-agatha-branch-christ/,self-released,"Right before virtually the entire music industry descended upon Seattle in the fall of 1991, flinging wads of cash at anyone wearing flannel and carrying a guitar case, a different part of Washington's Puget Sound area was the site of a smaller but still influential cultural event. In late August of that year, indie-rock godfather Calvin Johnson organized the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, a six-day festival that housed a vast array of DIY-minded bands, from the Spinanes to Fugazi. The 20th anniversary of the convention is coming up in a matter of weeks, and it's tempting to speculate which of today's bands would make the lineup if it were held in 2011. With their fun-loving brand of lo-fi guitar pop, Seattle's Witch Gardens would be a very appropriate choice. Guitarist Casey Catherwood has been involved in Seattle's do-it-yourself music scene for almost decade, including a stint writing the Underage column for The Stranger. Given those bona fides, the light cloud of tape hiss that floats above the bright melodies on Alice, Agatha, Branch & Christ feels like a genuine homage to direct forebears such as Beat Happening and the Vaselines, using those bands' playful artlessness to create eight infectious tunes detailing the joys and trials of youth. On ""So Many Parties"", after a false start and a tempo change, bass player Beth Corry, drummer Sara Beabout, and autoharpist Karolyn Kukoski capture the histrionics of a heartsick teenager standing in the corner of a birthday party: ""Here is not my home/ I'd rather die than be here alone,"" they sing. ""Softball Chick"" contains a hip-hop-inspired call-and-response that's charming rather than ironic-- a Nicki Minaj- or Trina-like assertion of female empowerment readjusted for the indie-pop set. Each song on the brief album stands out as a unique pop composition, and several are split into movements, with frequent key and tempo changes. The intro to ""Small Daring Boy"" is the closest the record comes to a melancholy moment, but even that track shuffles back and forth between tempos, eventually making way for a driving, climactic finish that expresses heartbreak through a sweetly sung round (the lyrics: ""You were never good to me like I was good to you""). The only real miscue comes from the sequencing of bouncy closer ""Baby Got a Haircut"", which would have been more fitting as an opening track. But that's only a small error among the treats available on Alice, Agatha, Branch, & Christ, an album that can stand proudly beside the work of the indie-pop heroes of yesteryear.","With a fun-loving brand of lo-fi guitar pop, the Seattle band's promising eight-song album can stand beside the work of the indie-pop heroes of yesteryear.

D,White Denim,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afde9d034d5c69bf47a8/1:1/w_160/0bf4f07e.jpg,2011-06-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15589-d/,Downtown,"White Denim telegraphed their entire new album via ""Regina Holding Hands"", from 2009's Fits. ""Regina"" sounded nothing like the skronky, speed-addled garage that had earned the Austin band a deal with RCRD LBL, and a lot more like a leftfield take on airy jazz rock. ""Breezy"" was the last adjective anyone was expecting to use for this band at that point, and the prospect of an full album of such tentative sap would've been enough to trigger the release of the dreaded ""cheese"" descriptor. Yet with their fourth album, D, White Denim double down on this very approach, and manage to make a pretty good LP out of it. How'd they do it? By expanding. First, they grew to a quartet, adding second guitarist Austin Jenkins to their lineup. Second, they dropped some coin on better recording equipment, moving from a trailer to an actual studio. And D is easily White Denim's best-sounding effort yet: The band's trademark shape-shifting compositions now feature clean, interlocking guitar lines, and singer James Petralli's voice has smoothed out into a raspy howl. It's also their most consistent album: Rollicking opener ""It's Him!"" sets the groovy Texas psych template to which the rest of the record hews closely. Along the way, White Denim are able to stir in a new set of psychedelic flourishes-- see the flutes and hippie lyrical mysticism of ""River to Consider""-- with the verve of a Fillmore West opening band. Even the post-Maharishi Beatles vibe of closer ""Keys""-- complete with strings!-- feels like a perfect extension of a confident band willing to stretch a bit. Who knows: Maybe it's a teaser for the next album? Personally, I'd prefer White Denim add a bit more choogle to their groove-- more oomph, a bit more low end to complement D's fresh focus on detail and lateral movement. They certainly have the rhythm section for it, and how great would it be for the album's opening triptych to stir in a little ""Ramble Tamble""? For now though, this LP's more than good enough. White Denim's inherent restlessness means that all the band's releases feel transitional to a degree, but D's measured restraint points toward the best possible direction for them.","Following the addition of a second guitarist and a move to an actual studio, the Austin band's fourth album is its best-sounding yet, all groovy Texas psych.

Debut,Vladislav Delay Quartet,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc09d034d5c69bf4772/1:1/w_160/36b417af.jpg,2011-06-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15561-debut/,Honest Jon's,"For most artists 15 years and at least as many albums into a career, titling a new album Debut could be taken only as a wan joke-- but Vladislav Delay (born Sasu Ripatti) has released albums under enough genuinely distinct aliases that the appearance of any new entity might very well deserve the designation. And looking at the relatively traditionalist name of Ripatti's latest outfit or at their website, which features a photo of the group arranged in a clean and spacious wood-paneled studio on stand-up bass, acoustic drum kit, keys, and electronics, you might expect the Vladislav Delay Quartet to be a straightforward if modernist jazz band (Ripatti's roots are in jazz drumming). Debut, however, wastes no time in disabusing a listener of such notions. The album opens with ""Minus Degrees, Bare Feet, Tickles"", eight minutes of cold, blistering, wind-tunnel static punctuated only barely around the halfway point by the introduction of a loose hi-hat and a distantly bleating clarinet. Even taken as a live-band extension of Vladislav Delay's chilly dub, this is pretty extreme, and it's a damn far cry from Ripatti's most lauded project, the artfully subdued vocal house of Luomo. From there, though, the album opens up considerably, with ""Santa Teresa"", a nearly 12-minute long song anchored by a repeating, resonating upright bass pluck around which percussion clatters, saxophone squalls, and grains of delay cluster and scatter like a time-lapsed weather pattern. ""Des Abends"" continues in this vein and expands further. The same elements are at play-- percussion clatter, bass thrum, tinkling glass notes-- but here they echo through much larger, frostier acoustic spaces, and that photograph of the band all spread out in the studio starts to make a lot more physical sense. Having established a pace and tone (willfully glacial, on both counts), the rest of the album begins to disrupt those parameters. ""Hohtokivi"" begins with the single most electronic sound on the album, a low, buzzing bass pulse that grows increasingly staticky across the song's seven-and-a-half minutes, letting off vents of steam and crackle and one final plume of feedback. ""Killing the Water Bed"" puts Lucio Capece's sax/clarinet playing upfront over Ripatti's busy cymbal rolls. ""Louhos"" introduces a dubbier vibe, propelled by a thick electronic kick drum beat. The relatively brief songs (at about four minutes apiece) ""Presentiment"" and ""Salt Flat"" provide the album's most ambient passages, the former creating a billowing fog of bass hum, the latter a brighter, optimistic coda, with what sounds like a church organ cresting over a ticking drum click and unreeling white noise. If this sounds like a difficult listen, even from someone as consistently expectation-defying as Ripatti, it's actually a surprisingly enveloping, and immediately rewarding album. The songs have an open, improvised feel, and the tracks themselves, for all their icy howls and inclement racket, sound roomy enough to build a house and settle down in them. It's those acoustic spaces, almost more than the live instrumental flourishes with which the band inhabits them, that set the Quartet's Debut apart from what was already the more challenging of Ripatti's main guises, pushing Vladislav Delay into even stranger, more viscerally rewarding territory.","A far cry from Delay's vocal-house project Luomo, Debut is nonetheless a surprisingly enveloping and immediately rewarding album.

Sound Kapital,Handsome Furs,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd413d197565213a350/1:1/w_160/3fa28a61.jpg,2011-06-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15579-sound-kapital/,Sub Pop,"Up to this point, it's been somewhat difficult to listen to the broke-down electro-pop of Handsome Furs without imagining what Dan Boeckner's more established band, Wolf Parade, might do to elaborate on it. Though the projects sound very different, his songs for both bands rely heavily on his bleary-eyed lyricism and jagged guitar chug. But as Boeckner could tell you, there's an easy way to get people to stop comparing your side project to your main gig: just break up the latter. But it's not just Wolf Parade's recently announced ""indefinite hiatus"" that casts Sound Kaptial as Handsome Furs' most passionate, committed album to date. Rather, by taking the emphasis off of Boeckner's guitars and giving greater shine to wife Alexei Perry's neon-bright keyboard lines and woofer-busting beats, Handsome Furs present themselves as a genuine, ready-for-the-floor synth-pop band rather than a frazzled rock act that happens to use synthesizers. With new wave confections like ""Memories of the Future"" and ""What About Us"", Sound Kapital effectively conjures an alternate 1980s where Bruce Springsteen didn't just tinker around with synths and drum machines on occasion, but actually tried to make a full-on Depeche Mode record. However, Sound Kapital isn't so much an 80s throwback in sound as in its spirit of sincerity. A handful of songs on the record were inspired by the Furs' 2010 visit to Burma, where they performed alongside bands who were quite literally underground, forced to perform out of sight of the oppressive local authorities, with minimal access to electricity, let alone recording technology. Given that Boeckner's always been drawn to the struggle of the underdog, the experience of being around people who routinely risked incarceration just to play their music naturally had a profound effect on his songwriting; the opening song is built around a click-tracked chant-- ""When I get back home/ I won't be the same no more""-- that effectively serves as a promise to put aside petty, material-world concerns. And rather than deal in general, impressionistic images of hearts on fire and shining lights, the album's centerpiece song, ""Serve the People"", pays tribute to the Burmese band Side Effect with street-level scenes of ""kids... making noise with their generators on till the cops say, 'move along.'"" It's the sort of arm-swaying anthem you could easily imagine the Furs' Montreal mates Arcade Fire turning into a Coachella-rocking showstopper. But the humbly lo-tech take-- all shuffling drum-machine breaks and squelching frequencies-- feels very true to the environment that inspired it, where music is exchanged via pirate radio and the power can be suddenly cut at any moment. The more frenzied companion track ""Cheap Music"" reframes the same scene, but downplays the overarching themes of valor and perseverance to convey the illicit, punk-rock thrill of hearing ""a thousand lonely kids making noise in the basement."" Therein lies Sound Kapital's greatest success: Handsome Furs no longer feel like a stripped-down antidote to Wolf Parade, but more like a band that's able to execute progressively grander, emotionally resonant ideas while staying within their limited means. And nowhere is that more evident than on Sound Kapital's urgent, feedback-swathed closer ""No Feelings"", which, despite its seven-minute sprawl, counts as Boeckner's most immediately affecting performance since Wolf Parade's ""Shine a Light"". The song sees Boeckner returning to familiar concerns (emotional ennui, self-doubt) but as it reemerges from a My Bloody Valentine-like miasma for a final sprint to the finish, Boeckner's repeated claims that he's ""got no feeling"" provide Sound Kapital with a rare moment of irony: Everything about this song-- and this entire album, for that matter-- suggests this heart's still got a lot left to burn.","With Wolf Parade on indefinite hiatus, Dan Boeckner gives his full attention to Handsome Furs, and they craft their best album yet.

New Brigade,Iceage,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd113d197565213a34a/1:1/w_160/b66c3aae.jpg,2011-06-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15576-new-brigade/,What's Your Rupture?,"Here's what we know about Iceage: They are four friends, ages 18 and 19, from Denmark. Their debut LP, New Brigade, has actually been out in their home country since January, with a much smaller, limited run coming to the United States earlier this year. These are the essentials. Over the past few months, as New Brigade has been passed back and forth online with increasing enthusiasm, there has been a remarkable amount of chatter, some of it focused on their age, some of it on their music, some of it on faraway mystique. Not long ago, a Danish daily deemed them ""teenage punks full of anger and anxiety,"" a line galvanized by bloody post-show photos of smiling audience members published on their blog. Questions like ""Are they the saviors of punk music?"" have been posed, as though punk music needs saving. They just played their first show in the U.S. this past weekend, in Brooklyn. It sold out. The New York Times and The New Yorker have weighed in. They're set to return to Roskilde this summer. As you may have already realized, there's a swirl of information and interest surrounding this band right now, at the heart of which is their music. And it turns out that New Brigade is a refreshing and extraordinary debut. These four have located a punk-rock sweet spot: mixing the black atmosphere of goth, the wild-limbed whoosh of hardcore, and the clangor of post-punk. It's a feat made all the more impressive by one very important intangible: energy. While they still have room to grow as songwriters, the energy in every atom of New Brigade's charred, sub-25-minute rush is seductive. From the moment ""White Rune"" starts to quake until those last tangles of guitar conk out on closer ""You're Blessed"", there's little escape from this record's grip. Even the foreboding mash and march of ""Intro"", its wordless, 46-second pulse of a prelude, is enough to make you feel like you need to fling yourself in the direction of someone else. That said, despite the typically direct, blunt-object nature of ""punk,"" much of New Brigade is also impressionistic. Elias Rønnenfelt's words (sung in English rather than Danish) are largely unintelligible, leaving a lot up to the heart and imagination. Rønnenfelt finds an effective way of sharing just enough room for listeners to fill in the blanks. As if mimicking the motions of his own guitar, he scythes his way through each song, usually to anthemic heights. That you can hear in the gasp of ""Collapse"" and starry-eyed bounce of ""Remember"". Even more so in aforementioned climax ""You're Blessed"", a song that sounds like a more irritable cousin to the poppy, post-hardcore emo that came of age here in the 1990s. The album's grit has nothing to do with fidelity. While Iceage employ decidedly abrasive no-wave textures, New Brigade was recorded in a proper studio. The result is a recording whose snare hits and basslines announce themselves with real fury. And though a lot of this music might seem from a distance like a dozen ideas thrown together in the space of a single song, what they've done here is deceptively precise and exists on a deeply personal, unfiltered plane. All these lurches and groans and crashes and bangs and stutters and roars come together to form one consistently rousing, emotionally immediate whole. From them to you.","On their debut LP, this young band from Denmark mixes post-punk clang and goth atmosphere, serving it up with a massive dose of addictive energy.

Sagara,diskJokke,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdac0084474cd0c1b51/1:1/w_160/20a792b2.jpg,2011-06-28 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15584-sagara/,Smalltown Supersound,"So far, Oslo-based producer diskJokke (Joachim Dyrdahl) has been the best kind of anonymous: a producer beholden to a genre (space disco) who consistently pumps out tidy, form-fitting jams. His music is defined as much by its constraints-- self-imposed, mostly-- as by its content (that he has worked as a mathematician makes perfect sense). But here, Dyrdahl has strays from the strictures of beatific electronic music in favor of tone-poem ambience. Sagara was commissioned by Norway's Øya festival, which provided Dyrdahl the resources to travel to a place of his choosing and study music. After sampling musicians in Bali and Java, Dyrdahl abandoned the idea of a dance album and instead focused on incorporating the tones and modalities of Gamelan music into pillow-soft mood pieces. It's not much of a stretch: Gamelan is typically busier and noisier than Sagara, but its massing of percussive sounds can lead to an ethereal blur. Dyrdahl takes that blur and spreads it, jam-like, over long instrumental passages. The resulting sound isn't ""new"" unless you're the type of person who owns only diskJokke albums, but Dyrdahl's background as a classically trained violinist and electronic producer serves him well here. Sagara has a rich, saturated ambience that deserves a fine sound system and a generous twist of the volume knob, but it's uneventful in a way that suggests patience. This is nowhere more evident than on ""Mandena"" which, after three minutes of bare nothingness, acquires a misty palpitation and a splattering of percussive tones. At just over 35 minutes long, Sagara is refreshingly unimpressed with its own concept or bigness. It is a short, loving letter from Dyrdahl to a music and region that has inspired him. It's not until the final track, ""Panutup"", that Dyrdahl's instincts as a dance producer get the best of him. He lifts his tonal haze, offers some gorgeous ringing chords and field recordings before introducing-- finally!-- a thwumping disco bassline and a steady, surging kick drum. Dyrdahl spins this sudden percussiveness into a skyward, uplifting Balearic anthem before fading it out again. It's a moment of such surprising and stunning motion that it's possible to view the previous 30 minutes of music as one long, patient build. (There is an irony to the notion that the one time Dyrdahl really approaches the beauty and mysticism of Gamelan is when he interrupts his experiment and returns to his craft.) Dyrdahl never received enough credit for the excellent sound design of his work, and while Sagara seems nothing more than an interesting detour, his careful ear and sense of structure are here in spades.","The Oslo-based producer known for crisp space disco tries his hand at Gamelan-inspired ambient music.

The Miners' Hymns,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd3c0084474cd0c1b44/1:1/w_160/d562d2f5.jpg,2011-06-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15578-the-miners-hymns/,Fat Cat,"Jóhann Jóhannsson's The Miners' Hymns is the instrumental soundtrack to Bill Morrison's dolefully spare documentary about the history of coal mining in northern England. As such, it will not make a stellar accompaniment to your next barbecue. Composed for brass ensemble, organ, and a light scrim of electronics, the album takes you places that are woefully ill-suited to early summer; it feels perfect for a grim, drizzly late autumn, when wet leaves are choking gutters and the air carries the threat of pneumonia. This might not be the most inviting sound world to contemplate, but Jóhannsson's confident touch with it is powerful, and The Miners' Hymns creeps into your consciousness like a musty attic draft. Jóhannsson builds the album's six pieces out of a series of low tones echoing faintly across a distance, like ships through fog. Extended periods of charged silence separate each burst. The structure is firmly ""EVENT-pause-EVENT""-- a meek cluster of sound, an evaporation of echoes, a blank band of dead space. The effect is like slipping pebbles in a pond, watching the ripples distort your reflection, and then waiting for the surface to clear. Jóhannsson's pacing with this material is patient unto funereal, and occasionally the music appears to be just hanging there. But train your focus on it, and you will sense the slowly darkening atmosphere. The lonely horn figure of ""Freedom From Want and Fear"", for example, gathers weight with each repetition, so that when it blares, halfway through the track, the contrast registers like a flash of heat lightning. The album was recorded in a Durham cathedral, and Jóhannsson has given the music a distinctly liturgical feel-- the descending bassline in ""There Is No Safe Side But the Side of Truth"" mimics the groaning sway of Renaissance sacred music. And when two sourly whining quarter tones give way to a gorgeously warm brass chorale in ""The Cause of Labour Is the Hope of the World"", the album's final track, it feels like an epiphany, a generous flooding of light that casts a backward glow on all the gloom and pallor that preceded it. Suddenly, the album's mood retroactively shifts. It's not a bleak autumn record; it's a halcyon autumn record, bathed in inviting half-light. I am reminded of playing basketball at dusk, and that imperceptible moment when you just can't see anymore and everyone reluctantly heads inside. It's a quietly exhilarating ""hallelujah"" that depends entirely on the previous 45 minutes of buildup for its weight, a nice reminder that some things are worth sticking it out for.","The Icelandic composer's score for Bill Morrison's film about coal mining in northern England will not make a stellar accompaniment to your next barbecue.

Pl3dge,Killer Mike,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd5b1335d7bf1699fef/1:1/w_160/57d8f39d.jpg,2011-06-28 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15580-pl3dge/,SMC,"If all political rappers were a little more like Killer Mike, political rap might not be so irritating. While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, Killer Mike comes across as a smart man with a short fuse. The hulking Atlanta rapper entered the game as Big Boi's bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like ""Snappin' & Trappin'"" and ""The Whole World"". But after a few years in major-label limbo and a messy split with Big Boi, Mike emerged as something else: a righteous underground-rap avenger, a live wire with a moral compass and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent ""That's Life"", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: ""[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."" That one song was a more effective rage-trigger than anything John Goodman roared into his webcam during season one of ""Treme"". But Mike's political fury never quite dominates his rapping; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about economic inequality. Paradoxically, that gives his political stuff more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style. With every album these days, Mike sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a major-league rap star. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who presumably aren't knocking down his door anyway: ""If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: T.I. and Gucci Mane, unable to stay out of jail, and Young Jeezy, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly under the radar, a fiery old-school Southern rap record with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any radio station on Earth. The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and stormy soul samples. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on ""Ready Set Go"", or the dazed Flying Lotus collaboration ""Swimming"". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together beautifully, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, Mike emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of Oscar Grant and airing out some reservations in Obama: ""We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against their own economic interests, caving to the manipulation of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some lurid street-level threats, he delivers: ""Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat."" As Mike's persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the audience he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of his best-loved recent songs, ""That's Life"" and ""God in the Building"". And a remix to ""Ready Set Go"" even gives Mike's audience the feel-good reunion with Big Boi that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, Mike is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from ""That's Life II"", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But Palin and Pelosi both gon' have you broke as shit""), or Mike's decision to share the spotlight with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on ""Ric Flair"". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a sturdy platform for one of rap's fiercest and most incisive voices, and it achieves that goal completely.","The one-time OutKast associate sounds comfortable in a more underground role and mixes sharp political observations with an appealing musical sense.

Carbonated EP,Mount Kimbie,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc713d197565213a339/1:1/w_160/9bfa1748.jpg,2011-06-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15569-carbonated-ep/,Hotflush,"With each successive move dubstep makes toward bass-drop bombast, there's been an equal if less prominent retreat in the opposite direction-- grainy and pared back, leaning on nuance instead of force, making subtly room-flooding sounds out of negative space and white noise. Another year or so of this, and ""minimal dubstep"" could go from a sub-descriptive side road into a full-on genre in itself. At that point, Mount Kimbie could be posited as the new genre's equivalent of microhouse favorites like Pantha du Prince or Justus Köhncke. Crooks & Lovers was the UK duo's big breakthrough, the crystallization of an approach that theorized how a bass-centered, midrange-heavy style could be pared back into ambient music. Cohort and collaborator James Blake has taken more of the shine in that department, but the melodic strides and the pervasive sense of loose-jointed tension on Crooks & Lovers managed to leave just as strong an impression over time. But the point where minimalist becomes ephemeral is a dangerously easy one to cross, and it's hard to think of a better line-straddling example than the Carbonated EP. This release pairs a selection from Crooks & Lovers and two new Mount Kimbie originals with a trio of remixes from a couple of London bass-music fellow travelers and an artist from a (slightly) more far-flung if compatible minimal techno background. The last effort clicks the most, likely because it's Peter van Hoesen at the controls; the Belgian producer who won raves from aficionados for last year's canyon-deep Entropic City takes the bubbly, R&B-flecked ""Carbonated"" and flips the original's burbling rhythm into a Detroit-inflected pulse that has more groove and energy to it than anything else on the EP. That makes van Hoesen's remix something of an outlier, even if it's one of those outliers that also happens to be the best track out of six. The other remixers work more closely alongside Mount Kimbie stylistically, but this time around their efforts feel a bit detached. While Airhead's remix of ""Carbonated"" has more of a direct connection to the source material than van Hoesen's-- making a primary element out of the distinctive propeller-whir hook that kicked off the original-- it spends too much time wafting along on little more than that murmuring throb, distant near-subliminal snares, and a simple bass kick that provides the least amount of momentum necessary to qualify this as a dance track. Klaus' remix of ""Adriatic"", meanwhile, takes the trickier route of building off a track without much to build on-- the original's only 88 seconds long, and worked more as a diversionary sketch than a highlight of Crooks & Lovers-- opting to slow its snippets of acoustic guitar and soul vocals to a funereal crawl that drags on for five and a half minutes of quicksand entropy. The untouched Mount Kimbie tracks have their own pull, though, and ""Carbonated""-- still one of the best cuts in the duo's arsenal-- is joined by a pair of unreleased tracks that give another couple of inroads into their sound. ""Flux"" rides on phased bell tones, liquid-trickle basslines, and hitching vocal yelps that intersect with hiccupy Brazilian cuicas, pulling itself up into a nice peak at the end. ""Baves Chords"" is a bit thinner-- hammer dulcimers and drum washes run through the same audio-stretching techniques that gave us the 800% slowed-down remix of Justin Bieber's ""Baby"", overlaid with glitchy harps, spare but cavernous handclaps, and warped, wordless chipmunk soul vocals. These tracks are both as wide-open in their rhythmic texture and their crackling warmth as the pair's best work, breathing and moving in ways that the remixes either fail to grasp or simply choose to circumvent. It's evidence that Mount Kimbie's knack for building sonic cathedrals out of empty spaces might just be more singular than you think.","The UK duo's latest pairs a selection from Crooks & Lovers with two new tracks, plus remixes from the bass-music and minimal techno realms.

4,Beyoncé,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd7b1335d7bf1699ff2/1:1/w_160/66eaeff7.jpg,2011-06-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/,Columbia,"One of the year's best music videos was directed by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The camera phone clip shows Beyoncé rehearsing her new album's opening eternal-love ballad, ""1+1"", backstage at ""American Idol"". There she is: eyes shut, standing in front of a mirror, singing her guts out while family and friends look on in quiet awe. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's ""Take Away Show"", its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. ""Help me let down my guard,"" she belts. And, as Beyoncé finishes the song, you hear her proud husband let out a joyous ""woo!"" It's all quite endearing and personal-- two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple. ""Sometimes you need perspective,"" wrote Jay in an intro to the video on his Life + Times website. ""You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time."" It's a fitting sentiment and song to introduce 4, which largely deals with monogamy and all that comes with committing to one person for a potential lifetime. Which, like a bad marriage, might sound boring, repetitive, staid. But, in Beyoncé's more-than-capable and still-in-love hands, a relationship that lasts can seem as complicated and rewarding as anyone would hope. ""If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn/ 'Cause I got it with you,"" she testifies on ""1+1""-- potentially dubious words from a woman who certainly has ""something,"" but her mainlined vocals quickly dismiss mere logistics. The song boasts some of her finest-ever singing laid over a bed of warm and flowing synths, strings, and bass that manages to connect the dots between Sam Cooke and Prince without sacrificing any Beyoncé-ness. ""1+1"" is that rare wonder: a wedding song that pleases but doesn't pander. The only recent pop ballad that comes close to its power is Adele's stunning ""Someone Like You"". But where that song-- and its massively successful corresponding album, 21-- wrung out the aftermath of young heartbreak, Beyoncé is aiming for something a bit more challenging with 4: love the one you're with, and have some fun doing it, too. The album's relative riskiness extends to its music, which side-steps Top 40 radio's current Eurobeat fixation for a refreshingly eclectic mix of early-90s R&B, 80s lite soul, and brass'n'percussion-heavy marching music. All of the album's best elements, thematically and sonically, burst ahead on Jay-Z ode ""Countdown"", a honking, stutter-step sequel of sorts to ""Crazy in Love"". The new track makes 10 years of loyalty seem just as thrilling as the first time, with Beyoncé offering her partner copious praise in that famed half-rap cadence: ""Still love the way he talks/ Still love the way I sing/ Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain."" The album's carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including the Kanye West-assisted ""Party"", which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, bubbly 80s keyboard tones, and 90s girl-group harmonies. The track has Beyoncé infatuated once again while its mid-tempo bounce provides prime summer barbecue background. ""Love on Top"" lilts like a lost Reagan-era smash, its light-as-air bop recalling Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder at their sunniest. And ""End of Time"" is perhaps 4's most strident declaration of co-dependence; sounding like En Vogue remixed by a high school pep band, the song has Beyoncé finding the strength in two as she sings, ""I just wanna be with you/ I just wanna live for you/ I'd never let you go!"" That track-- along with most of 4's stand outs-- was co-written and co-produced by the star's other invaluable partner, Terius ""The-Dream"" Nash. The pair first combined forces on super hit ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", but their collaborative relationship fully blooms on this album's ramped-up back half, including the bombastic, Major Lazer-sampling empowerment tract ""Run the World (Girls)"". As a songwriter, The-Dream has a way of drawing out a side of Beyoncé that's both more personal and brash, and, as seen on his several brilliant solo albums, his production style routinely references past greats while standing in the now. Tellingly, without his help the album stumbles, as on the overblown ""I Was Here"", a faceless, theoretically-inspirational slog written by veteran schlockmeister Diane Warren. (Unsurprisingly, ""I Was Here"" is the only cut on the record that wasn't co-written by Beyoncé herself, too.) Elsewhere, Babyface spearheads the decent ""Irreplaceable"" retread ""Best Thing I Never Had"", which probably wouldn't sound out-of-place on a Vanessa Carlton album, and Sleepy Jackson/Empire of the Sun leader Luke Steele worked on the ungainly ""Rather Die Young"", which ruins its Philly soul vibe with a theatrical Broadway glaze. (Steele also contributed an awful hook on Jay-Z's Blueprint 3 trash-can bait ""What We Talkin' About""-- can we get him away from this couple, please?) Ironically, 4's deluxe edition comes with three bonus songs that would easily count among the proper album's finest moments. Chiefly, The-Dream co-written/produced ""Schoolin' Life"" is an irresistible Prince tribute that's much more motivational than ""I Was Here"" could ever be: ""Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?"" struts Beyoncé. The singer has said she recorded more than 60 songs while making 4, and some of the wrong-headed inclusions are lazy attempts at re-creating her past hits. But they are few. And the lion's share of the album-- along with its excellent deluxe tracks-- has one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted, which is always exciting. After 2008's I Am... Sasha Fierce, which saw Beyoncé catching up to trends when she wasn't trying Streisand-wannabe ballads, 4 is more akin to her wily sophomore solo album, B'Day. But where that record was preoccupied with the club, 4 is happy at home; on Off the Wall-style bonus track ""Lay Up Under Me"", the contented 29-year-old gushes, ""You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club, just come on lay up under me tonight."" If anyone can make a quiet Friday night come off like an open-bar blowout, it's Beyoncé.","It's a more mature album with songs about the intricacies of relationships, but 4 has its share of stunning tracks, many co-written by The-Dream.

Shirts vs. Skins,Graham Wright,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb8b1335d7bf1699fbc/1:1/w_160/9cd8234d.jpg,2011-06-27 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15553-shirts-vs-skins/,File Under: Music,"Graham Wright plays an often-overlooked role (keyboardist) in an often-underrated band (Tokyo Police Club), so it's not like his solo bow comes with a lot of the usual baggage. Hell, even when the Hold Steady's ivory-tickler Franz Nicolay embarked on a similar side project, certain expectations came with the mustache. All we know is that there's label machinery legitimizing Shirts vs. Skins as more than just downtime with Bandcamp, that it's deemed worthy of our attention by more than just the guy who made it. So what does Wright have to say? Well, to find out, you have to get past ""Chucklefucks"", which unwisely decides to incorporate its title-- one of the least euphonious not-quite words in the English language-- into Wright's prickly, pitter-patter melody. It just piles on from there. Soon come the skittering drum machines and lyrics that lean heavy on signifiers instead of insight (""the party kids,"" ""the party,"" ""pockets overflowing with designer drugs""), the sort of things usually found on the relationship-altering demo CD your friend made that you'll never unhear. But after that mercifully brief 80 seconds, ""Heaven's Just for Movie Makers"" is a comparatively welcome respite, hewing more towards TPC's modes of zippy tempos, generously upfront vocals, and sharp, concise hooks. It's also more indicative of Shirts vs. Skins as a whole. The album hangs looser than Wright's main gig, however, dabbling in rootsy singer-songwriter fare, giddy synth-pop, and too-cute saxophone skronk. The lyrics also lack TPC leader Dave Monks' cryptic, literary bent. They tend toward straightforward girl talk laced with proper nouns, recalling the ""like K-Ci & JoJo, like Sonny and Cher, you're Tina but I'm not Ike"" kicker from ""Favourite Colour"", off of Champ, the 2010 album by Wright's main band. All of which means that if you can trust I'm using the phrase ""*Welcome Interstate Managers-*era Fountains of Wayne"" as a sales pitch rather than an exit cue, this might be in your wheelhouse. Shirts vs. Skins does feel weirdly out of time in 2011, its power-pop classicism and sense of irony having a decidedly mid-1990s vibe that values kitsch over actual nostalgia. ""Soviet Race"", in particular, could've found refuge in the buzzbin. Its narrative about astronauts and international espionage doesn't mean much upon the slightest inspection, but it's all prelude to Wright's biggest chorus, which takes obvious pleasure at stressing, ""I was shitfaced!"" while serving a softball to the egghead critics who generally eat this stuff up (""I read your book... I give it three stars out of a possible five""). To Wright's credit, Shirts vs. Skins actually manages to be catchier in a more straightforward way than either Champ or its 2008 predecessor Elephant Shell, two records that certainly didn't lack hooks. Whether or not you want these songs to stick in your head is another matter entirely, and it'll be largely based on your tolerance toward the standard options in the power-pop package deal-- namely, the stilted dialog and single-serve plots that make it feel more like a collection of sitcoms than songs; the overbearing pursuit of cleverness; and the weirdly dismissive attitude toward females that often reduces them to a single crush-worthy quirk or some incorporeal straw-woman that dumped your sorry ass. You might end up taking the latter's side on ""Leftovers"", which stretches a single relatable image way too far. ""Something Stupid"" quotes Uncle Tupelo but is mostly an unspoken homage to Fountain of Wayne's ""She's Got a Problem"", or any other song that disguises wimpy condescension as actual concern. Likewise, ""Canadian Thanksgiving"" poses as brotherly advice to a moony-eyed teen but more or less turns into a bro's tall tale about a pretty girl who gets a few drinks in her and inevitably ends up embarrassing herself in a restaurant bathroom. Despite all of the above, this album might still hold a huge appeal for listeners. This stuff's not unlike gangsta rap-- you come for the formalism and escapist pleasures, not for the nuanced take on gender relations. But for such a casual record, Shirts vs. Skins can occasionally strike at a deeper discussion. Power-pop of this sort is often overlooked, but it can also be stifling taken in large doses-- Wright's clear talent and occasional charm notwithstanding. The wacky neighbor POV wears pretty thin, but ultimately more oppressive is the glorification of generic heartbreak. It makes allowances for juvenile self-absorption that actual romance never does.","Tokyo Police Club's keyboardist makes his solo debut with a record of straightforward power-pop.

Hour Logic EP,Laurel Halo,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc65e6ef95969321e6c/1:1/w_160/048f919c.jpg,2011-06-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15568-hour-logic-ep/,Hippos in Tanks,"Last spring, Brooklyn electronic artist Laurel Halo's King Felix gained significant notice among fans of murky electronic pop. The EP secured official release by the end of the year through Hippos in Tanks, and the increased attention Halo was drawing made sense. King Felix prominently featured Halo's expansive vocal range (also exercised on Ford & Lopatin's Games-era cut ""Strawberry Skies"") doing curly-cues and loop-de-loops above beds of tickled, arpeggiated synths; the results recalled Dirty Projectors' disjointed acrobatics as much as the cosmic analog odysseys of Brooklyn pal Daniel Lopatin's Oneohtrix Point Never. As the electrifying cover art of the Hippos in Tanks re-release suggested, the music possessed a strange, swarming quality, originating at a central point and covering everything in its path. King Felix sounded like a blueprint for something larger and more sweeping, a hint at greater potential not quite realized. But on Halo's latest EP, Hour Logic, she takes a sharp left turn, largely ditching anything that resembles conventional melody for dark, propulsive rhythms where her beats run wild. As heard here, Halo's version of dance music comes over as sterile and inert-- the beats are there, but they never coalesce into anything in particular. When they're not static (as they are on the constant drip of ""Aquifer"") they wind up lost in the clutter. She moves through some intriguing ideas-- the acid squiggles that surface near the end of the title track, ""Speed of Rain""'s dewy beat-broken opening-- but there's a lack of momentum and the tedium disrupts Hour Logic's flow. For all its relative experimentation, the EP's most impressive moment takes place during ""Constant Index"", which finds Halo's distant cries submerged in synth washes and long stretches of delay. It's no coincidence that Halo is at her best when returning to-- and refining-- the ideas presented on King Felix. So Hour Logic ultimately seems like an intermittently interesting misstep, a bold experiment that doesn't quite come off.","On the follow up to her debut EP, Laurel Halo ditches conventional melody for dark, propulsive rhythms and lets her beats run wild.

Since then he has quietly issued a handful of singles. In January, Wruhme-- né Gabor Schablitzki-- put together a sly, melodic mix for Cologne's Kompakt, followed in April by Thora Vukk. Released on DJ Koze's increasingly impressive Pampa imprint, Wruhme's second LP is an elegant, eminently listenable blend of chirpy beats, homespun voices, and sighing keyboards. Wruhme's music has taken a path similar to that of one of his contemporaries, Isolée; tracks that once feasted on funny noises and unexpected pops have been smoothed over, like practical jokers settling into masters of the quip. Thora Vukk also has something in common with Nicolas Jaar's Space Is Only Noise; both are albums of modest treated-keys beauty, though Wruhme's music is deeply rooted in house traditions and tempos that Jaar's plays fast and loose with (or, more accurately, slow and loose). Thora Vukk is a sunrise album, one that sits lightly. Its tracks don't build and peak so much as arrive and taper. ""Brucke Eins"", already a placid interlude featuring dollops of organ, ends with someone calmly pecking at a keyboard. Wruhme uses voices sparingly but memorably; ""Pnom Gobal"" features a back-and-forth between casual scatting and a string section. The closest Thora Vukk comes to cresting is a breakdown during ""Tulpa Ovi"", in which a skittering break comes to a stop for joyful call and response between a performer and a child audience. It's telling that Thora Vukk's most memorable moment occurs when the music all but drops out, but it's also misleading. Wruhme's sound design is careful and deep; the album's homespun feel is in tone only (it would be lazy to compare it to the sweet, sepia-toned photograph on the album's cover, but, well, yeah). He leaves plenty of space between the muted chirps of his drums and those lovely velvet keys, and there's lots to be gained by playing the record loudly on a good system. Wruhme's career path and stature make Thora Vukk the type of album that never escapes the clutches of house connoisseurs, but fans of Jaar and even Four Tet will find a lot to like in its pacing and beauty.","German electronic music veteran's second album is an elegant, eminently listenable blend of chirpy beats, homespun voices, and sighing keyboards.

It felt as if the duo of Benjamin John Power and Andrew Hung were shifting around vast tectonic plates of noise, daring one another to see how much detail their music could retain while pushing the volume firmly into the red. That love of scale remains firmly intact on Power's debut album under his Blanck Mass moniker, although he's purposefully tempered its overall feel with a more reflective bent. This is a themed work, based around ""cerebral hypoxia and the beautiful complexity of the natural world"" according to the Blanck Mass Bandcamp page. At times it crosses paths with the folksy elements of the Ghost Box aesthetic, where creepy electronics are twisted to produce the kind of deadened atmosphere found in old horror flicks like Witchfinder General. It sometimes shares that film's lack of refinement, with Power allowing his sounds to loop over vast expanses of time, matching Fuck Buttons' prowess for chiseling crude beauty from repetition. Much of this music is rooted in the ambient tradition; there are no beats, and Power often leans heavily on a wash of wave-like noise similar to what Brian Eno cultivated on ""Alternative 3"" from Music for Films. On first glance it can feel like there's little structure underpinning the glass-like inflections of ""Sifted Gold"" or ""Chernobyl"", but dig a little deeper and subtle shifts in tone and mood gradually unravel. It demonstrates how adept Power has become at adding and subtracting layers of gentle abstraction in his music. Blanck Mass also shows how well he can foster an atmosphere of unease without pushing everything skyward all the time. Occasionally it threatens to topple over into a Fuck Buttons-style morass of jagged edges, but on songs like ""Sundowner"" the prickly distortion dissolves into clear digital glitchiness. The track has a woozy atmosphere, causing it to feel like Power and his table of instruments are rocking back and forth on a creaky old ocean liner. Elsewhere the Blanck Mass sound sinks into introspection. ""Sub Serious"" is a densely layered piece full of twinkling loops and percussion elements that make it sound like it was recorded in the middle of a rain forest. The mood subtly slides from pessimism to dejection throughout; on ""Sub Serious"" it's the former, while the similar ""Land Disasters"" and ""Icke's Struggle"" use great swells of synth to generate an air of sadness. The latter two songs both use sampled birdsong, one of the few overt attempts to maintain the natural-world theme. Occasionally Power steps close to his other band's territory, particularly on ""Land Disasters"", where he channels that wall of gnarly distortion again and sets it to the kind of icy interference that dominated ""Sundowner"". Those two tracks feel like distant cousins here, both feeding off the same kind of ultra-frosty banks of towering electronics that Power was clearly obsessed with creating during the making of this record. Blanck Mass reaches its apex in the form of the extraordinary 13-and-a-half minute ""What You Know"". The shifts in tone encompass many of this album's contrasting styles, including the glacial pile-ups of noise and the dips into impossibly quiet reflection. At its close there's even a hint of groove as a bass synth expands and contracts, ultimately blocking out the rest of Power's palette and opening up new lands for him to explore with this project. The air of serenity shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Fuck Buttons' work-- in many ways Blanck Mass functions as a continuation of the bittersweet emotion pulled out of the closing Tarot Sport track ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"". But this mostly feels like Power taking all his musical impulses and tunneling inward toward a more nuanced spot. The shadow of his other band always feels like it's on his shoulder, but that tension between his past and present guises is what makes this work so well. Blanck Mass is all about Power excavating new domains while still working within that great glut of voluminous space he's already mapped out.","Fuck Buttons' Benjamin John Power offers his solo debut as Blanck Mass, working in a slower paced ambient vein to hypnotic effect.

Black Up,Shabazz Palaces,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc8b1335d7bf1699fe1/1:1/w_160/60d59e95.jpg,2011-06-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15570-black-up/,Sub Pop,"Shabazz Palaces emerged two years ago with an air of carefully cultivated mystery: Two EPs appeared, identified only by the Arabic patches on their covers. The music was some of the most exploratory hip-hop of the year, an enticing batch of fragmented raps and woozy, disorienting beats. You could find precedents for this stuff-- the amorphous wanderings of cLOUDDEAD, the jazz rap of the early 1990s-- but these EPs were largely on some sui generis shit: Nothing else out there sounded quite like Shabazz Palaces. The Shabazz Palaces and Of Light EPs featured an MC going by the name Palaceer Lazaro, and he introduced an alternately glittering and gritty urban noir taking place in the unlikely setting of Seattle. That the reedy yet resonant voice behind Palaceer's raps was readily identifiable as Ishmael ""Butterfly"" Butler of downtempo rap collective Digable Planets (and, later, Cherrywine) did little to lift the shroud. Butler declined interviews and dodged photographers, and when he did speak, his answers were as evasive as his raps were richly, if obliquely, illustrative. His reticence was an attempt to let the music speak for itself and avoid comparisons to his previous acts (adding some alluring intrigue didn't hurt). And some comparisons are inevitable: The EPs continued the darkening trend that occurred in between Digable's unlikely breakthrough Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space) and thornier follow-up Blowout Comb, and which developed further with the sinister funk of Cherrywine. But if Shabazz Palaces' first phase was about building a mystique, their Sub Pop debut is the product of opening up. Black Up lets some sunlight in, breathes fresh air, and finds Butler returning to an occasionally lighter flow, the most unburdened he's sounded since the world first heard him. Which is not to say that these are easy, uncomplicated songs. Butler continues to eschew traditional verse-chorus structures in favor of tracks that unpredictably diverge and then pool into lone, evocative words or concise chants. And if some of Butler's rhymes and sonics are breezier than before, his tracks still retain their moody, hard-thudding, and sometimes psychedelic atmospheres. Most of these tracks end somewhere very different from where they begin. ""Free Press and Curl"" opens the album with a down but defiant rap (""Musically and bitch-wise, too/ I lost the best beat that I had"") delivered over stuttering crunching drums and bass vibrations. Three minutes in, the tempo slows into a kind of galley song, a murky drift over which Butler fires off a couple of final, biblically imperative (""thou shalt..."") verses. ""An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum"" (the album's track titles throughout are fascinating) begins as a playground chant stretched and smeared into a queasy loop over muffled kick and grainy snare. But then after a minute, everything drops out for a spooky mbira solo from Shabazz sideman and percussionist Tendai Maraire. ""Youlogy"" starts as a busy, druggy swirl-- a heaving bass, a synth wobbling in one ear, voices cut and pasted, echoing asymmetrically, everything dropping out on the word ""high"" in ""to get you HIGH""-- and then breaks for some jazz trumpet and snippets of stylized dialogue, before proceeding as an altogether different, relatively cleared-out, bass-and-drum track. That Shabazz Palaces' songs follow such inscrutable routes makes it all the more striking when they coalesce around a repeated word or phrase. ""Free Press"" builds up to the rousing chant, ""You know I'm free!"" over a ghosted gospel chorus. On ""Are You... Can You... Were You? (Felt)"", Butler exclaims, over ringing piano notes, wafting strings, and one great tinfoil handclap that swings in just half a beat later than expected, ""It's a feeling!"" ""Recollections of the Wraith"" glides in on two of the album's most effortless choruses, Butler first proclaiming/promising, ""Tonight!"" over a swooning, oohing female vocal, and then requesting, ""Clear some space out/ So we can space out."" That last one is about as involved as any chorus here gets-- these are hooks boiled down to their most essential. Even forays into traditional structure end up typically idiosyncratic. The album's lone loverman song comes out a treatise-- well, actually, ""A treatease dedicated to The Avian Airess from North East Nubis (1000 questions, 1 answer)"". It's birds and bees rendered as bop poetry, working up to an insistently smooth come-on line that turns from astral to anatomical with the addition of one little two-letter word: ""I want to be there/ Let me be in there."" The record's dis track, ""yeah you"", snarls and bites but it also laments and ends as a breathless, headlong exorcism. All this is both in keeping with Butler's track record and indicative of his status as a hip-hop elder, an MC with some well-earned gray in his goatee. And it's deeply refreshing to hear an artist who exudes such depth and consideration. Still, Butler is hardly yelling the kids off his lawn-- in fact, two of Black Up's best moments come from young guest stars THEESatisfaction, a similarly ""afro-eccentric"" female duo with whom Shabazz Palaces have been collaborating for much of the past year. Cat Satisfaction lends her rich singing voice to the dusty, repurposed jazz of ""Endeavors For Never (The last time we spoke you said you were not here. I saw you though.)"", while partner Thee Stasia raps over the hard, roboticized boom bap of album closer ""Swerve... The reeping of all that is worthwhile (Noir not withstanding)"". That the last sound you hear on the album is one of THEESatisfaction's voices echoing out into the ether feels like an anointment and a look ahead (news that Sub Pop signed the duo leaked back in February). For all his recent (relative) forthrightness, Butler is still fascinated by art's ability to communicate what conversations cannot. ""I can't explain it with words/ I have to do it,"" he raps on one song; on another, he delivers one of the album's catchiest, most motivating maxims: ""If you talk about it, it's a show/ But if you move about it, then it's a go."" Beyond the ""just do it"" swooshing of these lines is a meatier paradox: that Butler uses a lyrical form to decry the limitations of words and exalt the meaningfulness of action. In Shabazz Palaces, Butler enacts the union of these opposites-- words as action, action into words-- and it's no exaggeration to call this transmutation what it is: magic.","After two fine EPs, the experimental hip-hop project helmed by former Digable Planets leader Ishmael Butler steps out with a brilliant full-length debut.

"I Love You, Dude",Digitalism,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc49d034d5c69bf477c/1:1/w_160/8f2b1faa.jpg,2011-06-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15562-i-love-you-dude/,V2DowntownCooperative,"A lot has changed since Digitalism debuted with Idealism in 2007. France's Justice and their blog-house followers took peak-hour rave rock to its breaking point and left it limping by the side of the road. Electronic dance music cycled back through more traditional and frequently more mellow strains of disco and house. And everyone more or less stopped talking about once hopelessly hot labels like Ed Banger and Kitsuné. All of which actually leaves the Hamburg duo poised for a big second act. Idealism showed clear pop aspirations, from the Cure-repurposing of ""Digitalism in Cairo"" to the streamlined vocal number ""Pogo"". With thumping house beats still a big pop presence, now might be as good a time as any to realize such a crossover. But I Love You, Dude doesn't shake off the confines of genre to reveal a shiny new pop act underneath. Nor does it meaningfully improve on Digitalism's previous formulas. Instead, Dude is a mere rehash, as its title's similarity to 2009 Paul Rudd-Jason Segel bromance I Love You, Man, would suggest. Lead single ""Blitz"", with its filtered, circling synth lead, effectively recreates some of the glitzy appeal of Idealism's ""Zdarlight"", but with no moment quite as catchy as that song's effervescent guitar break. ""Antibiotics"" sort of recalls Tiga's Soulwax collab ""What You Need"", with its pitched-down exhortations giving way to jabbing drum machines and distorted synth. Neither track is more essential than its predecessors. The songs that go for the pop jugular don't have much better luck. ""2 Hearts"", with its eighth-note keyboard builds and buzzing, sidelong synth stabs, comes off like a pale echo of Phoenix's ""1901"". The album's collaboration with the Strokes' Julian Casablancas is a slight improvement, its chorus rising almost gracefully out of its dull lumbering verses. But if naming your album I Love You, Dude is perhaps guileless, then what would you call having Casablancas sing the chorus (""And so you run,"" he yelps) and then calling the track ""Forrest Gump"" (because, you know, Forrest ran)? The rest of the album is one undistinguished track after another of grinding, growling synths and digitally clipped drum machines, from the impotent fanfare of ""Stratosphere"" to to the distorted plod of ""Miami Showdown"". There's a reason that, a single here or there aside, the Hype Machine hive mind collectively burned out on blog-house, and it's that all the super-compressed synth noise just gets to be physically exhausting to take in after a while, whether over the course of a club night or a long-playing album.","The Hamburg duo's sophomore album adds bromance to the blog-house of 2007 debut Idealism, a house-rock hybrid recalling Justice or Simian Mobile Disco.

Memories Come True,Cliffie Swan,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afca5e6ef95969321e71/1:1/w_160/a99d5a7c.jpg,2011-06-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15573-memories-come-true/,Drag City,"Late last year, Cliffie Swan's Sophia Knapp and Linnea Vedder gave up on Lights, the acrobatically eclectic psych-pop troupe they'd led through two increasingly daring LPs. With Cliffie Swan, the pair-- alongside Alana Amram, and, on tour, with Erika Spring and Hannah Rawe-- have nixed much of the bend-over-backwards genre-melding of their previous work, paring down Lights' wide-ranging, whiplash-inducing influences to a more manageable shortlist while playing up their considerable way with hooks. Memories Come True, their debut as Cliffie Swan, matches patient 70s style power-pop with hints of sleek, Ric Ocasek-indebted 80s sheen and slack, rangy 90s rock; a mix less heady than their old band's, perhaps, but even more deftly handed. The ramshackle riff singer-guitarist Knapp gives ""Dream Chain"", a sunkissed little groover about making eyes at a show, all but tumbles out of the speaker, whereupon she musters a lovely, easygoing vocal. Knapp's clear, cool voice seems absolutely at ease over the low-key tangle of her guitar turnarounds; never the showiest singer, these softer, more spacious songs are a far better fit for her warm, laid-back style than the histrionic hard-rock dalliances on Rites. Memories' first three songs prove its most immediately ingratiating; after ""Chain"", the husky ""Soft and Mean"" gets a little snarl going-- Knapp's cooly delivered kiss-off of, ""you know, your attitude, it really wrecks my mood,"" cuts to the quick-- and the Cars-like ""Yes I Love You"" strips things back so far the hook can't help but jut out. They may be making fewer moves on these lean, chorus-heavy tunes than they did flitting between styles on Rites, but they seem more confident in each one. Memories' title track beings as a dirge-y, downtrodden flute-driven psych-rocker until its chorus turns lovely and languid; ""Full of Pain"" sounds more than a little like a Stevie Nicks tune until Knapp's scuzzy guitar snakes its way into the frame. Memories' midsection is its most psychedelic, with lighter-flicker ""California Baby"" taking on the sludgy metal that occasionally snuck its way onto Rites. Just as the disc's knotty pop lead-in often calls to mind Fleetwood Mac without ever quite going full McVie, there's something about this mid-LP mix of vocal serenity and bleary guitar crunch that suggests they've been rummaging around in the mid-90s buzzbin. But they've gotten so good at couching even their more obvious influences in threads of ambling melody that any easy comparisons seem somehow beside the point. That's a big shift from Rites, an album that seemed most impressive for the derring-do of its genre-stacking. Echoes of everything from the Breeders to Black Sabbath may ring throughout Memories now and again, but there's a serenity and self-possession driving these tunes that isn't on loan from any other band. The chanty ""Home"" throws another curveball before the fluttery, harmony-driven ""She's Almost Gone"" twirls in. The track's light-as-a-breeze melody threatens to blow away before Knapp throws a bit of guitar boogie underneath it; as with Lights, Cliffie are constantly tucking little bits of melody into the pockets of their tunes, and while there's less zig-zagging in these arrangements, their melodies still seem to dodge the obvious move. While sturdy, the album's final three-fer-- slow burner ""Take It Easy"", the gossamer ""So Long"", and the Pretenders-esque closer ""Climb on Top""-- proves a bit less satisfying than the killer trio that opens the record and the swirly stuff in its center. But the pair has gotten rather good at jamming out deceptively direct, harder-to-place pop-rockers, and while Memories doesn't exactly end with a bang, it's hardly a whimper, either. Those who fell for Lights' anything-goes genre eradications may feel a bit shortchanged by the relative simplicity of the easygoing Memories, and fans of pure pop may find these low-key hooks a bit too low-impact. But while Cliffie Swan's airy melodic excursions might be several degrees less daring than Lights' exploratory pop-psych, it's both easier to like and easier to grok. And, hey, no whiplash.","Duo behind the eclectic psych-pop group Lights offers this debut under its new moniker, rife with 70s power-pop, 80s sheen, and slack 90s rock.

Mount Moriah,Mount Moriah,by: Stephen M.

It's really as simple as that. I really wanted people to see Bellafea especially. I think you don't see a stage presence like Heather McEntire's more than a few times in your life. She's unbelievable."" Five years later, Bellafea's fate is unknown-- it's unclear whether they're on indefinite hiatus or broken up permanently-- but McEntire's charisma comes through strong and clear in her new act, Mount Moriah, which she formed with guitarist Jenks Miller of Horseback. While Bellafea derived its sound from spartan postpunk experimentalism, Mount Moriah explores more traditional folk, country, and gospel sounds. Those are, of course, the hallmarks of the bustling North Carolina scene-- one of the most interesting and active in the country right now-- but this new sound is a perfect setting for McEntire, whose voice suggests the expressiveness of Dolly Parton, the forcefulness of Carole King, and the textured restraint of Emmylou Harris. That voice is the ideal conduit for McEntire's lyrics-- or perhaps the lyrics are the ideal vehicle for her voice. She writes in a direct style that manages to incorporate interesting turns of phrase, knotty combinations of words, and evocative imagery. ""Social Wedding Rings"" deftly dissects circle-of-friends politics, neither lambasting nor condoning those interrelationships but finding a finer balance between fond remembrance and bitter regret. Even singing about hanging out in Colorado Springs and listening to Buffy Sainte-Marie, she's makes the song specific to her own experience yet sympathetic enough to apply to any listener. On ""Lament"", McEntire slyly subverts love-song conventions to write a declaration of love's opposite: ""A mouthful of bees couldn't stop me from whisperin', 'I don't love you,'"" she sings with a steeliness in her phrasing, right before the handclaps come in. Her repulsion is just as intense and wild as the attraction and excitement of first love. Dominated by shuffling drums, slow southern rock guitar licks, and pedal steel, the music on Mount Moriah is unobtrusive and reserved-- at times almost too much so-- but there are some fine flourishes in these songs, which feature members of Megafaun, St. Vincent, and Bowerbirds. The strings on ""Old Gowns"" quiver and sob, as if allowing McEntire to maintain her composure, and Miller's steady, chiming guitar theme on ""Lament"" gives her something to lean on. The music isn't as distinctive as the singer, but the band's mission is to support, not compete with, her performance. The accompaniment is understated by necessity, because what else can you do when the album's finest moment is McEntire singing wordlessly and eloquently on ""Old Gowns"", sustaining a single syllable to show the full, gorgeous grain of her voice?","Bellafea's Heather McEntire leaves the spartan postpunk of that band in favor of more traditional folk, country, and gospel sounds on this new project.

Tamer Animals,Other Lives,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb29d034d5c69bf4760/1:1/w_160/16c02ad2.jpg,2011-06-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15545-tamer-animals/,TBD,"Tamer Animals, the sophomore release from the Stillwater, Okla., five-piece Other Lives, is meticulously written and arranged and, at times, vividly cinematic. In the wrong hands, this music could feel labored or overstuffed, but thanks to the makeshift orchestra's shaggy ringleader, Jesse Tabish, these wistful Americana-styled tracks (influenced by Tabish favorites Sigur Rós and Godspeed You! Black Emperor) rarely feel forced. Instead of the big studio sound of their self-titled debut, Tamer Animals feels organic and lovingly crafted, a record whose lushness often invites you to simply collapse into it. Other Lives fits nicely with the pastoral richness of Fleet Foxes (whose influence is felt in the vocal harmony arrangements here) and the elegantly wasted music of Kurt Vile. On ""Landforms"", crestfallen strings swell with Tabish singing about the ""oceans and plains,"" and you can almost taste the salted air. The dark, hymn-like ""Weather"" is similarly visual, but prophetic and baleful. ""The sun is getting closer to the world,"" sings Tabish, clearly not talking about soaking up rays. Tabish has enlisted a group of players that holds these intricate pieces in place. It's not as if the songs here feel heavy or overloaded-- in fact, most of them are positively buoyant, thanks to the richly colored interplay of all the instruments and the spacious production. Nearly every member pulls double and triple duty on cellos, violins, clarinets, keys, trumpets, and drums, and in a live setting, the band constantly shifts and repositions to hit every mark. On record, these professional assets come through even stronger. Still, Tamer Animals isn't without its flaws, the quality of the vocals chief among them. For something so painstakingly made, it's strange that most vocal takes-- including some of those terrific harmonies-- sound oddly flattened. On an album about leaving behind the things you love, this seems like one element Other Lives should've made more of an effort with, as the pained stoicism in Tabish's voice doesn't always match the grandiosity of the music. But that grandiosity makes it feel as if Other Lives are coming from a million different directions at once. ""Old Statues"" has the whispery endlessness of a spaghetti western soundtrack; the string draws nicked from Radiohead's ""How to Disappear Completely"" impart a deeply haunted vibe to the provincial lope of ""For 12""; ""Woodwind"" channels the magical spook of a Grimm fairytale. Even if the emotional intent often feels recycled from other records, Tamer Animals is a record that takes you places.","Meticulously written and arranged, the wistful Americana of the sophomore album from this Oklahoma group feels organic and lovingly crafted.

Coming Up [Deluxe Edition] / Head Music [Deluxe Edition] / A New Morning [Deluxe Edition],Suede,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afcb5e6ef95969321e74/1:1/w_160/a12a7e30.jpeg,2011-06-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15571-coming-up-deluxe-edition-head-music-deluxe-edition-a-new-morning-deluxe-edition/,Demon,"The story of Suede splits well into two acts: the first version of the band, with guitarist Bernard Butler, and the second version of the band, with Butler gone and replaced by Richard Oakes, as well as keyboardist Neil Codling. The first version of the band released two albums, the crackling, sexually aggressive debut and the grotesque, brilliant, and dark follow-up, Dog Man Star, made as Butler and the rest of the band were pulling apart. The original version of the band fed on the tension between its two songwriters, Butler and vocalist Brett Anderson, and the records it made were harrowing and complex, both musically and lyrically. When the band reconstituted after its messy split with its guitarist, Anderson was in no mood to make another Dog Man Star. It's a difficult kind of record to follow up-- to come back with something that aimed for the same epic sweep and catharsis of that album would have ensured failure. Instead, when Anderson began to write with his new partners, he sought to change almost everything. The new Suede would be a very different band from its predecessor, even though it had the same singer and rhythm section. The new pieces had a lot to say about that. Oakes and Codling immediately began writing new material for the band, and Anderson found that what they were writing fit well with the new direction he hoped to take the band in. It wasn't a clean stylistic break, necessarily. Oakes had found his way into the band by sending a demo tape to the Suede fan club; when Anderson overheard drummer Simon Gilbert listening to it, he thought it was an old Butler demo, and the 17-year-old guitarist vaulted to front of the long line of people auditioning to be Suede's newest member. Codling came to the band more conventionally: He was Gilbert's cousin, and the new songs they'd been working on immediately after Oakes joined required keyboards, so he was hired. This new three-way creative partnership was considerably less volatile than the Anderson/Butler pair, and partly as a result, the music lost its dark edge. Back in the band's early days, Suede were heralded as one of the banner acts of the UK music media's new Britpop obsession-- a fact that chagrined and even disgusted Anderson-- and Dog Man Star had in some respects been Anderson's attempt to show that Suede were something distinct from Britpop. The band's next album, Coming Up, released in 1996, feels somewhat like Suede jumping back on board the movement it helped launch. At the very least, it finds the band returning to its glam-rock roots, and it's about the most day-glo rock record this side of Ziggy Stardust, with an intentionally garish Peter Saville sleeve to match. It vaulted the band back to massive commercial success in the UK, selling over a million and a half copies and spawning five top 10 singles. Listening today, the album's biggest shortcoming is its lack of low-end. Producer Ed Buller chose to highlight the vocals, guitar, and synths over the band's formidable rhythm section, a decision that unfortunately leaves the album's roughly 50/50 mix of bouncy pop songs and melancholy ballads sounding a little thin. Coming Up is still a very good album, though. Anderson's lyrics are considerably more superficial and humorous than they had been in the past; this would eventually become a problem, but on uptempo, fluorescent rock songs like ""Beautiful Ones"" and ""Trash"" it works because these songs are just so damned catchy. And there is a lot of depth in the ballads. ""By the Sea"", actually written by Anderson during the Butler years, is simply beautiful and heartbreaking, while ""Saturday Night"" works perfectly as a long exhalation at the end of the album's long and disorienting party. The album is reissued with all of its contemporary B-sides, minus the Neil Codling demo ""Digging a Hole"", which is omitted without explanation. This is very important, because there's a whole second album on disc two that's easily as good as Coming Up itself. The epic slash of ""Every Monday Morning Comes"", the relentless dub stomp of ""WSD"", the grinding descent into debauchery of ""Europe Is Our Playground"", the exhilarating pop rush of ""Sound of the Streets"" and Anderson's baritone-voiced lead on the scuzzy, Dog Man Star-ish rock song ""Have You Ever Been This Low?"" are all essential to understanding just how versatile this band was at this point in its career, and that's just a sampling of the 19 B-sides included on this set. This is an important theme of this reissue campaign, and one that will become even more important later. The huge success of Coming Up left Suede in a position to do basically anything they wanted with their next album, but it took three years for the band to put together the follow-up. Codling was at times bed-ridden with chronic fatigue syndrome after the grueling 18-month world tour in support of Coming Up, and Anderson had fallen deeper into drug addiction, especially crack. Bassist Mat Osman, who along with Simon Gilbert has always been a source of stability and reason for the band, recalls Anderson's drug buddies hanging around a lot during the sessions and generally ruining the atmosphere. The UK music press interpreted the long wait between albums as a sign that things were going wrong and that the next LP might be another Dog Man Star. When Head Music finally came out in 1999, anticipation was so high in Britain that Virgin Megastores all over the country changed their name to Head Music for a day on the release date. The album wasn't another Dog Man Star, but it was considerably darker and thornier than Coming Up. The band worked with producer Steve Osbourne to get a much heavier, more groove-oriented sound, and Codling's synths moved to the center of the sound. Head Music is neon to Coming Up's day-glo, and it's aged well sonically-- it is easily the band's most underappreciated album. Part of the reason for that is Anderson's lyrics, which on certain songs were simply terrible. ""Savoir Faire""'s notorious opening couplet, ""She live in a house/ She stupid as a mouse,"" is the worst offender, but the slide toward superficiality that began on Coming Up accelerated here, with Anderson sounding more like a bored observer than participant in the nightlife he sings about. Most of it sounds splendid, though. ""She's in Fashion"" is a simply effervescent and weightless pop song; the mysterious orchestral swirl of ""Indian Strings"" is captivating; ""Hi-Fi"" has a chunky electro bounce that still sounds modern; and the slinking pop noir of ""Asbestos"" easily forgives the sometimes clunky lyrics. The band's attempts at stomping, punky rock on ""Can't Get Enough"" and ""Elephant Man"" might have been better replaced by breezy fluid B-sides ""Leaving"" and ""Let Go"", though, and Anderson's solo acoustic stab at political commentary on ""Crack in the Union Jack"" is expendable. Perhaps reflecting the band's unsettled state at the time, the period B-sides overall aren't the world-beaters of the past, and they're spread across different producers (here again, a Codling-sung B-side, ""Weight of the World"", has been left off). Suede's final album, A New Morning, is almost an afterthought in the context of the band's whole career. In his liner notes, Anderson wonders whether it even should have been made and imagines a much different tracklist from what actually went on the album. The disc of B-sides here is very important, because it's easily better than the proper LP-- it's the reason I'm rating this reissue higher than I did the album on its original release. The band was coming apart as it made the record. Codling had left due to his illness, though he still contributed some songwriting; he was replaced by Alex Lee, the former keyboardist for good-but-forgotten Britpoppers Strangelove. For his part, Anderson had kicked drugs and isolated himself to write songs. The record that came of all this is Suede's sunniest and most organic, but also its least substantial. On ""Lonely Girls"", Anderson outright repeats himself-- the song is a list of girls, coupled briefly with something that each of them does, which makes it a virtual re-write of the old B-side ""Young Men"". His voice was also worn by years of abuse, and he sounded a little ragged singing the otherwise buoyant hooks of ""Obsessions"" and ""Positivity"", though it's hard to begrudge him the brighter outlook he displays on those songs. Listening to all the music here, though, it's easy to hear how, by bringing songs such as the stately ballad ""Simon"", the strangely haunting acoustic singalong ""Campfire Song"", and the unusual, slightly psychedelic ""Instant Sunshine"" out of B-side exile, they could have pieced together a better album from these sessions. Still, A New Morning is not a bad record, and it sent the band out on a hopeful note that was strikingly at odds with much of what had preceded it. The five-piece Anderson/Codling/Gilbert/Oakes/Osman version of Suede has reunited and is touring, and a few years ago Anderson and Butler reconciled and made an album together as the Tears. Anderson has a budding solo career but has left the door open to a possible Suede album sometime in the future. If it never happens, so be it-- the band's legacy is already sealed. These three albums, and Coming Up in particular, show a band that picked itself up remained creative and worthy in the wake of what could have been a fatal loss. These releases give us that whole run in all its messy imperfection.","The latest in the Suede reissue series show a band that remained creative and worthy in the wake of what could have been a fatal loss.

Fania Records 1964-1980: The Original Sound of Latin New York,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc25e6ef95969321e65/1:1/w_160/e2706af0.jpg,2011-06-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15564-fania-records-1964-1980-the-original-sound-of-latin-new-york/,Strut,"In 1962, Johnny Pacheco got divorced. One of the partners in the firm that represented him during the proceedings was Jerry Masucci. Pacheco was a bandleader; born in the Dominican Republic, he moved to New York with his parents when he was 11, studied percussion at Julliard, and started his own band in 1960. With this band, he was working on a fusion of all the Caribbean styles that could be heard in New York at that time, bringing together the related traditions of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban music to plant some of the seeds that became salsa. Pacheco and Masucci formed a much deeper connection than the average lawyer-client bond, and in 1964, they founded the Fania label, initially selling records out of the trunk of a car in Spanish Harlem. Pacheco and Masucci signed many of the brightest young lights on the New York Latin scene, and over the next 15 years, the label became essentially synonymous with the emerging salsa movement. Pacheco was the label's house producer and from 1968, led the Fania All Stars, a supergroup of some of the label's best musicians. But Masucci was more than just the business end of things. He attended sessions, bought lunch for the musicians, and with his brother Alex, encouraged the development of the music. Strut's new Fania compilation documents that development over two packed discs, with key tracks by Willie Colón, Rubén Blades, Héctor Lavoe, the Fania All Stars, Celia Cruz, Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria, Joe Bataan, and others. It's a good introduction to the Fania sound and stable of artists, steering refreshingly clear of songs where the funk beat has taken over. In fact, one of the central tensions of this music is the way the musicians work to incorporate some of the groove of funk without surrendering their own rhythmic heritage. Caribbean music (and much other Latin American music as well) is built on a very different concept of rhythm and harmony than most North American music. The African elements of North American music come to it less directly than the African elements of Caribbean music, which were preserved more strongly. Where rock, R&B, funk, soul, and even classical music tend to think in terms of a beat or pulse that is determined separately from the key the song is in, Caribbean music is constructed around a different rhythmic concept called the clave, which covers both the rhythmic drive and tonality of the music. So you'll hear plenty of cycling, hypnotic piano figures, locked in with simple bass lines, underpinning these songs, while an arsenal of percussion defines and accents the different parts of the rhythm. It gives even the slowest, mellowest songs an undeniable momentum, as one bar pours effortlessly into the next, with vocals and horns syncopated on top. Most of the songs are sung in Spanish, though there are exceptions. Fania artists tended to be bilingual, with Caribbean heritage and American upbringing, but frankly, Spanish is the language better suited to the music. A substantial jazz influence can be heard in some of the playing as well-- check Willie Colón's nicely phrases trombone solo on ""The Hustler"", or the way Ray Barretto's swirling ""Indestructible"" seamlessly builds the clave around a series of jazz chord progressions. Mongo Santamaria's ""O Mi Shango"", by contrast, displays a heavy Afrobeat influence and rides a drum kit that plays with a sort of proto-disco accent on the upbeats. But that's the exception. For the most part, this set functions as an ace introduction to salsa music in all its brassy, undulating glory.","Strut's new 2xCD compilation documents the rise of salsa, with key tracks by Willie Colón, Rubén Blades, Héctor Lavoe, and others.

H–p1,White Hills,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbeea9e61561daa64dc/1:1/w_160/6b27ffc8.jpg,2011-06-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15559-hp1/,Thrill Jockey,"White Hills are a prolific, freewheeling sort of band. The New York space-rock explorers have stamped their name on more than a dozen releases from about half as many labels in the past six years. But they're at their best onstage, where they're loud, exhilarating, and unhinged, playing strings of songs as long as most bands' full sets. Though they're generally that way on record, too, I've never gotten the same feeling from White Hills through my own stereo speakers as I have through some bar's PA. The same holds for H–p1, a 72-minute, nine-track album that's often invigorating but sometimes just seems endless. White Hills are at their best when they're at their busiest, as on the closing, 17-minute title track, with misanthropic lyrics, a jagged riff, and expansive solos. It's complicated and exhausting, but it succeeds through sheer momentum. Moments like these make the band's second album for Thrill Jockey worth at least one trip. Similarly, ""The Condition of Nothing"" is a moody anthem with a squealing, instrumental midsection; it's nasty and noisy, a passage that a band with less of a filter might have omitted. Meanwhile, ""Monument"" evokes claustrophobia through power electronics and stacked, broken rhythms. It's intensity is compelling. But that lack of restraint cuts both ways. Elsewhere, White Hills include entire experimental sections that would have been better left in the practice room. Synthesizer study ""Hand in Hand"" is a jam with little movement, an exercise without an idea. ""No Other Way"" rumbles quickly to a doomy churn, with Ego Sensation's bulbous bass tone serving as ballast for Dave W.'s guitar and synthesizer builds, but then it spends its last three minutes whirring and droning through an Amon Düül II haze. It seems like an attempt to make an art-rock statement, but it mostly just thwarts the trio's thrust. Similar tones work much better during ""Paradise"", a krautrock heater (assisted by Oneida drummer Kid Millions) that lets up only in the last of its 13 minutes; by then, it's actually time for the band to exhale. Despite White Hills' plentiful output, pacing remains a problem for the group. Live, as they run marathons around a riff, that's less of an issue; you're surrounded in the moment, lost in the feeling. On H–p1, though, it means you spend half of your time waiting to reach the crest.","The New York space-rock explorers seek to capture a loud, exhilarating, and unhinged live show on their second Thrill Jockey album.

Fjree Feather,Forest Swords,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afae13d197565213a30d/1:1/w_160/2cf35932.jpg,2011-06-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15541-fjree-feather/,No Pain in Pop,"Matthew Barnes had a pretty good 2010. Not only did the UK producer known as Forest Swords release the Dagger Paths EP (twice), he was able to spend a whole year watching adventurous music fans slowly come around to his vision. What initially sounded like the dubby musings of a post-rock acolyte eventually revealed themselves to be much more: treatises on voice and memory, half-remembered R&B, and haunting guitars. The reissued Dagger Paths included six early Forest Swords tracks, which the Fjree Feather EP repackages (yes, again), with proceeds now going to Red Cross tsunami relief. This pre-Dagger Paths work shows that while Barnes' vision was already mostly developed, his toolbox was noticeably lighter. The six tracks here rely almost uniformly on slow, powerful drumming and a thick guitar assault that has way more in common with, say, early Flying Saucer Attack or Codeine than, well, Timbaland or Four Tet, whom Dagger Paths at its best could evoke. Barnes works in layers, his tones distorted but his pace measured. Fjree Feather sounds sinister as a result, churning over into psychedelic sludge and back again. Even in these early recordings, Barnes' style is distinct: ""Bones"" is, structurally, a metal song, with its bass lapping up against its plodding drums. But everything is thin-- that bass has no depth, those drums no oomph-- as if it's being played underwater. Dagger Paths was notable for its use of sampled, garbled voices. Fjree Feather features just the barest hints of that. ""Trust Your Blood"", the most forward-thinking track here, trades quasi-tribal chants with peals of electric guitar, its rhythms resisting the urge to putter to a stop. Fjree Feather finds a nice middle ground; it's sometimes a well-executed leftfield guitar album and other times a primer for the ghostly lean-tos on Dagger Paths. But Barnes is most exciting for where he might be going, not necessarily where he's been. With Forest Swords' back catalog presumably now exhausted, we can return to awaiting his next move.","Reissue of Matthew Barnes' pre-Dagger Paths work includes six early Forest Swords tracks, and the proceeds go to Red Cross tsunami relief.

Digital Lows,Cities Aviv,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc35e6ef95969321e67/1:1/w_160/87de979e.jpg,2011-06-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15563-digital-lows/,Fat Sandwich,"Cities Aviv begins ""Fuckeverybodyhere"" with a swaggering declaration: ""I could say some chill shit, but fuck all that."" Given the song's hazy production--Steely Dan's ""Midnight Cruiser"" hammered into jagged boom-bap-- the impulse to lapse into laconic stoner rap makes sense, but nothing plays out quite so predictably on Digital Lows. And so, in a drunken RZA-like flow, the Memphis rapper narrates his heroic origin story (""Bluff City born with a mic in my palm, I came up out the womb spittin' in the rarest of form""), hilariously big-ups himself (""In this 8-bit world I'm Bowser""), and mockingly croons the song's shit-talk title. Even the usual hip-hop clichés are afforded specificity thanks to his expressive wit and precise determination not to use words in the same exact way as every other rapper. He describes the girls he's pulling in by joking, ""as a youngin' jerkin' off I could never picture this,"" and refers to his haters as ""voyeurs."" Dude's got personality. He's a conflicted, searching thinker, with an outsider/insider perspective that merges the personal and the political, and lashes-out against the street mentality that mocks his forward-thinking hip-hop. ""Niggas say I dress white,"" he observes a little hurt, and retorts, ""flow must be cocaine."" He also makes a joke about ""white bitches"" whose ""favorite band is Mr. Bungle,"" which is just really funny. A few years ago this would be derisively called ""hipster rap,"" but that kind of categorical thinking has been pleasantly deconstructed by now. Digital Lows also has a group of out-of-nowhere, brilliant producers (Muted Drone, RPLD GHOSTS, Danny Dee, and others) behind it, all of whom contribute imaginative but still traditionalist beats. ""Black Box"" gives Gil Scott-Heron's ""Winter in America"" a blunted beatmaker refix. ""Die Young"" loops the intro to Depeche Mode's ""People Are People"" and turns the new wave classic into a hybrid of Rammellzee's avant-rap and Southern fight-rap. Three 6 Mafia's subtle influence on this next-generation Memphis rapper always manifests itself in subtle, indirect ways like that. ""A Beautiful Hell"", ""Doom x Gloom"", and ""sixsixsixes"" invoke Three 6 shock rap at moments when Cities, usually thoughtful and witty, sounds at the end of his rope, far beyond ""fuck it""-- so he lets loose with lines like, ""we fuck broads on the cross and they gulp the semen."" For contrast, placed between ""Doom x Gloom"" and ""sixsixsixes"" is ""Meet Me on Montrose (For Ex-Lovers Only)"", a bittersweet love story based on a sample of ""Oh Lori"" by the Alessi Brothers, which is quite possibly the least ""hard"" song ever made. ""Voyeurs"" lobs goofy disses at fellow rappers (""In a city full of fake Rick Rosses/ I rock Cuban link chains with inverted crosses"") and ends with a burst of digitized noise before giving way to hopeful album closer ""Float On"", a wizened freestyle over Blackbird Blackbird's cover of the Modest Mouse hit. Balance is important here, and the darkest moments of Digital Lows soon enough let up to highlight Cities Aviv's most winning quality: his mordant humanity.","Memphis rapper proves himself a conflicted thinker, with an outsider/insider perspective that merges the personal and the political.

Go Tell Fire to the Mountain,WU LYF,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb113d197565213a313/1:1/w_160/04cff0ac.jpg,2011-06-23 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15567-go-tell-fire-to-the-mountain/,L Y F,"WU LYF are for the children. Thus far, World Unite Lucifer Youth Foundation have taken equal inspiration from A Clockwork Orange and fellow Mancunians Happy Mondays to play out that adolescent fantasy of having every bird-flip rewarded by authority figures they're meant to offend. The British rags will help you fill in the rest, but here are a few talking points: getting a cold call from Michel Gondry only to ignore it; charging desperate A&R's 50 pounds for a demo; telling the UK press to fuck off, only to have them respond with statements like, ""they're reinventing the wheel."" Their web presence is so cryptic, they make Dead Air Space look like Lil B's Twitter feed. The band's incomprehensible frontman, Ellery Roberts, is an experiment in rock vocal abstraction, and yet sold-out crowds sing along to every proto-linguistic grunt. But the centerpiece of Go Tell Fire to the Mountain-- a stunning lockstep of drum rolls, tart guitar chords, and a maddening chant for raising beers and clenched fists-- makes it clear: This is life-affirming music, repulsed by hype and cynicism. The name of the song? ""We Bros"". The first word of the title is the important thing: Go Tell Fire celebrates togetherness. Approach the record with no context whatsoever, and it's fairly trad indie rock for crescendo junkies that could be laid over just about anything-- a stirring football highlight, your morning commute-- for instant widescreen effect. Dissatisfied with the sound they were getting in traditional studios, WU LYF self-produced in an abandoned church, which could once again be sniffed at as another publicity stunt. But they needed every bit of open airspace to capture their sound in full, and the building itself acts as an active participant. Silvery, melodic guitar lines are given extra dimension with decay and release, and a pipe organ draws lengthy sustain. And man, what it does for the percussion: the term ""crash cymbal"" has rarely sounded so literal, and a critical mass of reverb pushes the kick drum's natural tone to its limit on ""Dirt"" and ""14 Crowns For Me & Your Friends"". But underneath all that bouncing room echo, you hear a band trying to live up to its own hype, unglamorously woodshedding until every arrangement was tight as hell. It's danceable in the same way older Modest Mouse is-- a sweet spot that feels more limber than rock and too jittery to congeal into a groove like funk, but always in the service of some sort of physicality. Even the ballads rarely feel settled: The opening piano chords of ""Concrete Gold"" echo around a kick drum beat, before a call-and-response chorus that evokes the melodicism of D.C. hardcore. So while musically it connects the divergent anthem-fashioning of  Explosions in the Sky or Wolf Parade, Roberts' vocals evade just about any facile comparison. Attempts to classify it have ranged from Captain Beefheart to a variety of feral animals or malfunctioning household appliances, all making the same point, more or less: this is a trial by fire. He's screaming ""I love you forever!"" on the first track (""L Y F"") while revealing an alternate translation for their band name, yet in the urgency of Roberts' voice, you can see the matted fur and gnarled teeth of an endearingly ugly stray that you're still hesitant to love back (see also: his performance on the aptly titled military funeral march ""Such a Sad Puppy Dog""). And yet, similar to the way Jónsi applied the rhythms and phonetics of Hopelandic to convey an immutable, beatific divinity, Roberts lives within WU LYF's musical viscera as a vocal embodiment of animal instinct, projecting from the primitive part of the brain that can sense danger and react before it even acknowledges the source. You can occasionally make out his marching orders on ""Cave Song"" and ""Dirt"", but Roberts and WU LYF match up spasm for spasm to make their point clear: keep your head on a swivel, move. Do something. WU LYF bark out the title of ""Spitting Blood"" repeatedly over heraldic organ, and it's an evocative image leaving its completion up to the listener. On the chorus, Ellerby and crew yell ""we are so happy! Happy to see...,"" the intelligibility fittingly cutting off right there. After all, what is the phrase Go Tell Fire to the Mountain besides an open-ended call to arms? Closer ""Heavy Pop"" might be the only time WU LYF actively and clearly suggest what they're getting at (indeed, a dispatch on the band's mailing list describes the album as ""10 tracks of true heavy pop""). But Go Tell Fire rarely scans as ""pop music,"" and at times, it's content to give into pure texture and drift. Rather, this ""heavy pop"" translates to me as populism of real heft. More artistically rewarding records have been made this year, but when I think about WU LYF in the manner of Iceage or Odd Future as musicians that have made me genuinely excited about their potential impact on listeners, the same things that make them seem juvenile-- the artistic and personal volatility, the semblance of a roving gang more than a band, the invitation to indulge in your most disturbing impulses and yet feel morally superior to an ill-defined majority-- are the same things that feel totally galvanizing. And it's easy to imagine Go Tell Fire to the Mountain giving disaffected listeners the promise of an entry to something beyond themselves in a way that James Blake or Bon Iver can't. Maybe you've grown past that sort of thing, but what about a record of exhilarating expanse and passion that sounds like indie rock and yet feels way bigger? Well, Go Tell Fire to the Mountain is that too.","These mysterious Mancunians craft a debut of exhilarating expanse and passion that sounds like indie rock and yet feels way bigger.

Gimme Ten,Ungdomskulen,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb9b1335d7bf1699fbe/1:1/w_160/b4f6ef5a.jpg,2011-06-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15554-gimme-ten/,self-released,"Pitchfork's Stephen M. Deusner summarized Cry-Baby, the album Norway's Ungdomskulen released in 2007, by pointing out that it crammed in ""eight long songs with as many digressions, tangents, and asides as possible."" Anyone deterred by such extravagance may find something more palatable to chew on in Gimme Ten. But this is indulgence of a different kind. Here the band has simply stripped everything down and produced an album of 10 songs that are each around one minute long. The entire record breezes past in less time than it takes the average krautrock jam to hit its stride. The band members are doubtless prepared for people to wave this album away as a gimmick without actually hearing it, but to do so wouldn't entirely be fair. There's definitely an air of novelty about it, but there's still as much care and attention put into these songs as there is in their other material. Those ""digressions, tangents, and asides"" are all still intact-- they've just been vacuum-packed into an impossibly tiny space. That level of detail maintained by Ungdomskulen recalls other artists who have worked in a vaguely similar manner, such as the earliest material by Glasgow's the Yummy Fur or Manchester post-punkers bIG fLAME. This album also borrows heavily from the same stylistic mien as the latter. Much of it contains elements of the syrupy-funk undertow that bands like Orange Juice and A Certain Ratio were dabbling in during the 1980s. There's a spikiness to the guitar sound and a playfulness to the lyrics that also recall that era. ""Elle"" contains most of those elements, with its jerky stop-start rhythms and liquid bassline combining to do some pitch-perfect Gang of Four cloning. Some of these could be decent off-kilter pop songs if they were allowed to spread their wings a little-- ""It's Official"" and ""Number One"" cover the kind of ground that Franz Ferdinand and Queens of the Stone Age were respectively delving into with some success in the past decade. But therein lies a big part of the problem with Gimme Ten. Too many of these sounds and directions have been thoroughly regurgitated and explored in recent years. Ungdomskulen are certainly well drilled at taking those ideas and condensing them down into bite-sized chunks; it's just a shame they couldn't have chosen some less picked-over territory in which to perform this experiment. There are flashes of inspiration, but the nature of this record makes it a frustrating listen at times. ""Silver or Bronze"" matches synthesized handclaps with some wickedly lumpen rock riffing at one point, and ""Take It Back"" almost bears a chant-along chorus to go with its buzzsaw guitar. Ungdomskulen are more than capable of packing such short songs with plenty of belief, but too often it feels like they're straining under the weight of it all. With so little room to function, the rush to get to where they're going causes any genuine flashes of insight to be discarded with indecent haste. Despite such reservations, it's to their credit that Ungdomskulen have taken to this task with considerable zeal. There are 10 videos, one to go with each song, and the audio files are available for free download from the band's website. They even prove the worth of the one-minute format a couple of times. ""Walking the Dog"" works just fine as an impossibly brief pop track interrupted by quirky burping noises reminiscent of Elastica's ""Line Up""; ""Your Soul"" filters in post-hardcore yelling that's well suited to such claustrophobic expanses. As an exercise put out into the world for free, albeit with a decent amount of love and perspiration, Gimme Ten provides fleeting moments of enjoyment. But instead of really inhabiting its restraints and taking them somewhere revelatory, much of this album serves to highlight why it's not a very good idea to deliberately impose shackles on musical notions that are on the cusp of heading somewhere stimulating. If they're looking for a quickie follow-up project, it might be worth filtering these songs through the same kind of ambition they demonstrated on Cry-Baby, just to see whether all this abstraction can congeal into something more substantial.","Norwegian band offers a free album made up of 10 songs that are each around one minute long.

One Night in the Borough,6th Borough Project,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb69d034d5c69bf4767/1:1/w_160/3b75eb25.jpg,2011-06-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15552-one-night-in-the-borough/,Delusions of Grandeur,"What does ""deep"" mean? House music has been earnestly applying its wiki brainpower to this question for a couple of years now, processing decades of house and disco tropes and rendering an endless stream of variations upon the theme. Record after record aspires to the ideal type, with just the right balance of disco breaks, vintage-sounding drum machines, blocky piano chords, and suggestively yearning vocals. This goes for a lot of crappy records, but it also holds for some of the good ones, too. The debut album from Scotland's 6th Borough Project feels, in many ways, like a quintessentially of-the-moment dissertation on deepness; fortunately, it falls to the worthwhile end of the spectrum. I don't think that 6th Borough Project-- the duo of house producers Graeme Clark, aka the Revenge, and Craig Smith-- would dispute their role as a certain kind of revivalist (or, better, caretaker, preservationist, gene-splicer). It's right there in the introduction to ""Deep C"", where a stoned-sounding voice intones, ""Nothing is original. All human expression is really just endless variations. There are only a limited number of stories you can tell, but there's an unlimited number of ways to tell the same story."" Their story is a kind of idealized version of classic, disco-infused house, chock full of soul samples as super-saturated as old Polaroids. (I realize that we used up that metaphor on chillwave, but it does beg the question: Is house music's current retro fetish a manifestation of the same rearview-yearning currently running through indie music? Possibly.) They've definitely got a certain formula down: Tracks start off demurely, with a simple boom/clap drum pattern and a bass line, maybe a flickering loop of voice or guitar; then they swell about the middle, adding layers of keyboards and carefully daubing on more samples, like horn and voices. The climax often consists of a clipped phrase unrolling itself to its full length, a pocket in time before the groove kicks back in and the track disassembles itself, piece by piece. It's music made with a DJ's sense of sequencing, which is also a way of saying that it's largely about balance. And, make no mistake, it can be thrilling, especially when they slow down and linger on the contours of their source material, luxuriating in the wobble of a drum fill or the silvery arrow of a delay chain. 6th Borough Project and the Revenge are often counted as adherents to a slow-mo tendency in house music (along with Mark E, John Talabot, Nicolas Jaar and the Wolf + Lamb crew, and Prins Thomas and his Internasjonal label, among others), but not everything here is quite so downbeat. Perhaps half the tracks could fit into the second hour of any dance party-- or even the 11th, depending upon the club. ""Find a Way"" is a driving filter-disco number, all jangly guitar and throaty exhortation, that could crack the cinderblocks in a basement dive; the percussive ""Iznae"" is spacious but powerful, with bass and drums that thump your sternum, sampled snares leaning forward into the beat. (The album's least typical cut, it's also one of the best.) But ""If the Feeling's Right"" and ""Deep C"" both sink into wonderfully woozy territory, with blurry disco samples and synthesizers congealing around stumbling 4/4 kicks and handclaps. With its synths and vocoders, ""Deep C"" sounds like an experiment in new wave disco, maybe with a touch of Mike Oldfield's ""In High Places""; ""If the Feeling's Right"" shuffles along the border between exhaustion and ecstasy, spurred on by keening vocal loops. Back to nostalgia: the guys in 6th Borough Project know what they're doing. The name itself falls in line with classic house and disco monikers like Terrence Parker's Seven Grand Housing Authority and Began Cekic's Brooklyn Express; it gives off the same scent of sun-baked concrete and sweaty basements. It's not an original image of urban America, but then, nothing is original. 6th Borough Project repeat themselves sometimes, but they've got a solid grasp of the story they've chosen to tell. Somewhere, someone's writing a variation on one of their variations right now. The parts of this album where they depart from the script are enough to make me curious about how they'll respond.","Scottish production duo's debut album feels like a quintessentially of-the-moment dissertation on deepness in house music.

This art-folk group, comprised of recent Bennington grads (including Mountain Man's Amelia Randall Meath), are fascinated by opposites and negatives, by the sharp disparities between ambient and rhythmic, airy and earthy, restive and tranquil, male and female. For their self-titled debut, the circle of friends holed up in a tiny Massachusetts hamlet to arrange these dozen songs (most written by de facto frontman Tom Greenberg), then recorded them in Woodstock, New York. Spacier and less Americana-based than those settings might suggest, the result is an intriguing marriage of familiar sounds in new settings, sounding variously like a nodding-off Joanna Newsom or tUnE-yArDs with the caps toggle off. BOBBY's songs float loose and untethered, occasionally nudged along by percolating percussion. The contrast between drift and momentum are intriguing, especially on ""Sore Spores"", which pits an emphatic female vocal on the verses with a smoother, slyer male vocal on the chorus. The transition between them is intentionally jarring, suggesting a he said/she said account of a relationship. With its sleepy-eyed bassline and whispers of guitar, ""Nap Champ"" lives up to its title, then rouses itself, upping the tempos and setting the guitars on high shimmer. Neither half would work without the other, but together they form a dynamic whole. Sprawling to seven members, BOBBY take advantage of their inclusive roster by indulging many ideas, from the slightly menacing basslines to the great yawns of synths to the wordless vocal flourishes that adorn several songs. Opener ""We Saw"" knots up a melody that crescendoes with each steady repetition of its central phrases, the harmonizing voices moving against instead of with the plateauing chord changes. Few songs on BOBBY are quite so assertive, although the arrangements are often busy and mercurial: ""It's Dead Outside"" changes shape almost constantly, yet maintains its murky drift across seven minutes. At times, the extremes are too extreme, with too much dead air abutting too many busy passages. Mid-album instrumental ""Loading Phase"" lulls BOBBY to sleep, while closer ""The Shed"" marries a churchly organ theme to a small chorale of voices, suggesting a cathedral in miniature-- or a shed, perhaps. The idea is more intriguing than the music itself, yet the idea is appreciated, as is the ambition to mix sounds together in subtly new ways. In that regard, BOBBY intently evoke that drowsy space between wakefulness and sleep. It's lively in its drowsiness, which may be the album's most compelling and distinguishing contrast.","Art-folk group's debut plays upon the disparities between ambient and rhythmic, airy and earthy, restive and tranquil.

Although Pritchard's production shares way more in common with Californian beat-makers Flying Lotus and Daedalus, there's a fidgety energy at the core of his debut album, Limerence, that aligns itself with small town boredom and restlessness. ""Sacré Cool"" emerged last year and still sounds fresh and vital, with its low-end pumping against a wonky beat culled from Chemise's ""She Can't Love You"". Pritchard's retooling of that sample is full of left turns as he pulls the beat this way and that, but still keeps enough of a solid centre to nod along to. Indeed, no matter how deeply Young Montana dives into noodly, intricate production on Limerence, there's still a party edge propping things up. Most of the record drips pretty heavily with the influence of beatmakers like FlyLo, Madlib, and Prefuse 73 but there are some nicely unexpected nods in Pritchard's production too. The start of ""Mynnd"" errs towards the type of glacial, icy sound of Boards of Canada as analog-sounding synths sprawl on top of each other before being overtaken by typically skronking beat. With grimey synths and a swarm of exaggerated sounds, ""Legwrap"" is probably the most uncompromising production on the record. Propelled along by a clattering beat, a collection of outré sounds jostle for attention in the mix. The rattle of drums eventually falls in on itself, giving way to a stark, wobbly synth interlude. It's an example of pretty meticulous beat-mapping and might be a bit alienating if not for a gorgeous end section that Pritchard ushers in out of nowhere. The passage recalls Prefuse 73 at his more playful with a smooth soul sample chopped and spliced with subtle horns and cut-up vocals. The sudden change in direction at the end of ""Legwrap"" is something Montana pulls on quite a few of these tracks, lending the whole record the feel of an endlessly tuning radio, flickering from station to station. It adds a kind of broken, wonky dynamic that makes things feel slightly intangible. But occasionally these interludes add an interesting context to beats just at the moment they almost lose steam. Take ""Midnight Snacks"" for instance, a track that pumps with robotic, destroyed threads and a concealed vocal sample repeating, ""Can't take my eyes off you,"" until late on when Montana flips things again, delivering the sample back to its original old-timey roots. Moments like that, while not exactly groundbreaking, are nice touches that contribute to the overall sense of careful craft that exemplifies Pritchard's production. While his seamlessly stitched-together beats aren't quite as meticulous or obsessively compulsive as something like Prefuse 73's glitch-hop epic One Word Extinguisher for instance, there's still an impressive attention to detail. His thorough and restless production helps Pritchard transcend the efforts of many other bedroom producers by sheer virtue of his work ethic. Coming from a town like Coventry, one imagines you have to make your own fun, and that's exactly what Young Montana does on Limerence.","UK beat-fiddler's production shares plenty in common with Californians Flying Lotus and Daedelus, abounding in left turns and outré sounds.

Unknown Mortal Orchestra,Unknown Mortal Orchestra,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afaa13d197565213a308/1:1/w_160/d8690481.jpg,2011-06-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15539-unknown-mortal-orchestra/,Fat PossumTrue Panther,"Perhaps we'd all be better off if it was always ""all about the music, man."" But until recently, most discussion of Unknown Mortal Orchestra understandably went from lauding the unshakeable hooks of ""Ffunny Ffriends"" and ""How Can You Luv Me?"" to wondering why, true to their name, they remained anonymous. Protracted mystery can cause as much skepticism as the most overt press blitz, and information had been scarce since they popped up last year with a Bandcamp page of intriguing and untraceable songs. Some time after, those songs started being performed live by human beings who do mundane things like wear Baja drug rugs, live in Portland, and maintain an active Twitter feed. But there's still something eerily extraterrestrial about their debut LP, as if it were something that fell from the sky completely intact. You wonder if it might be an artifact from some psych-rock acid casualty, a long-forgotten Kiwi-popper, or an Elephant 6 offshoot. You want to poke at it, prod it, and try to carbon date it. None of the ambiguity would matter if UMO didn't spring to life from the first happily bopping seconds of ""Ffunny Ffriends"" and provide a half hour of rich analog sizzle that extends far beyond its meager recording budget (seriously, try and find it on vinyl, if possible). Though obviously more camera shy than Sleigh Bells or Cults, UMO represents a similar merger of simple and catchy melodies lovingly marooned in a raw, buzzcut production that puts an emphasis on the beats. The major difference for UMO is that their grit radiates from the inside out. Funk too often comes off as a jittery affectation or genre exercise even for rock bands who are pretty good at it. But for bandleader Ruban Nielson, it feels like a natural songwriting mode. The tortured but deceptively joyous hook from ""How Can You Luv Me?"" does plenty to draw you in, to the point where it might take the fifth listen to focus on just how limber the rhythm section is. It's hardly alone in sounding like a readymade breakbeat, so it's not surprising that the cratedigging likes of El-P, ?uestlove, and Das Racist have all taken to tweeting UMO's praises. But the sound wouldn't matter without songwriting. When a singer gets praised for incorporating his or her voice like another instrument in the mix, it's usually a reference to texture. And while Nielson often works in an androgynous, bristling tone that's certainly ingratiating on its own merits, it's more remarkable for its sophisticated approach to melody. Whether gripping the thrilling hairpin turns of ""Bicycle"", arranging complex lattices of syncopation on ""Thought Ballune"", or simply doubling down on his own leads on ""Ffunny Ffriends"", he converses with the inventive guitar playing like he's making a sales pitch. The riffs tell you what you're gonna hear, the vocals respond, and they link up in a way that makes everything so welcoming and familiar by the middle of the song itself. Combined with an expert use of space rare for such a lo-fi record, UMO manages a unique immersive and psychedelic quality without relying on the usual array of bong-ripping effects. As with Treats or Cults, it's easy to view the band's ability to do just a few things very well as a potential liability. But many of UMO's charms come while they jab at their limitations. ""Little Blu House"" dots its airy landscape with harmonies that seem to change color with each stacked layer, and closer ""Boy Witch"" indulges in some intriguing post-punk guitar damage that could indicate a future direction. That said, the track stuffed with the most experimentation ends up being the weakest. ""Nerve Damage"" is part envelope filter-hotdogging and part goony thrash, but pretty much all filler, ultimately. But hell, being able to recognize Unknown Mortal Orchestra's imperfection, however minor, lends their debut some humanity. As does being able to see a press photo of the shaggy but high-functioning space cadets who made it.","On its promising debut full-length, this Portland outfit mixes catchy psych-pop with a surprising and convincing undercurrent of funk.

Lovers Do,Bruno Pronsato,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb45e6ef95969321e51/1:1/w_160/d8d0596e.jpg,2011-06-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15550-lovers-do/,Thesongsays,"Bruno Pronsato is getting more ambitious. Despite cementing his reputation in 2008 with Why Can't We Be Like Us, one of the late decade's finest documents of minimal techno, Pronsato has spent the proceeding years taking risks. He made his debut on DFA as half of NDF with the entrancing ""Since We Last Met"". Most impressive was 2009's The Make Up the Break Up, a 38-minute, Nico-sampling single/EP/album that spun off into salty psychedelia. Not content to develop his ideas over the course of compartmentalized, 10-minute tracks, Pronsato's work has grown larger in scope. This growth culminates in his third LP, Lovers Do, a striking and massive statement that inverts the collaborative nature of much of house music in favor of a more self-contained approach. Simply put, Lovers Do aligns Pronsato with artists like Terre Thaemlitz and Theo Parrish, artists who abstract house music into large, emotionally charged canvases. Pronsato isn't quite as Art-focused as those two-- from its title on down, the politics of Lovers Do is personal-- but he does juggle house music's tropes to create a vast, rich world. He seems to ignore the genre's most confident ingredients (heavy four-to-the-floor beats, jacked-up sloganeering) and focus on the insular: snatches of jazz, mournful Rhodes keyboards, dubby rhythmic patter. He employs no divas, just a cast of mumbling insomniacs. On the album's second track, over a surprising amount of marimba, you are reminded repeatedly: ""Anybody else/ Anybody but... you."" There are moments-- as during the amorphous, copper-mouthed ""Trio-Out""-- that Lovers Do seems to have more in common with, say, Brooklyn beat-manglers Excepter than Berlin techno. Impressively, Lovers Do manages to be tonally dark without being foreboding or sinister. ""Noir"" probably applies, but not just the rainy vistas and shadowy alleys that term normally conjures. Think also of waking up in strange rooms, or characters floating in and out of focus. You could certainly stare out at the skyline with Lovers Do as your soundtrack, but its darkness is born out of moments of isolation and doubt we all experience. This happens because Pronsato takes great care not to suffocate listeners. Lovers Do is long-- too long, quite frankly-- but it offers plenty of outs. Its structures are smoky and ill-defined. Pronsato is reticent to let any one element dominate the mix: The vocals weave in and out, the drums flutter to sudden stops, and the electric pianos thumb through just a few notes at a time. Lovers Do picks up steam as it ends. The title track, which closes the album, sounds fittingly optimistic opposite the heavy-lidded opener, ""Lovers Don't"". There is a structure and logic to Lovers Do; it is immersive and artful but Pronsato went to great lengths to ensure that it not be overwhelming. Working again with muse Ninca Leece, Lovers Do acquires a femininity that suggests Lovers Do is a conversation, not an invective. Lovers Do casts this conversation into a diffuse cityscape, one whose darkness feels only temporary.","Seattle producer crafts an immersive and artful album that juggles house music's tropes to create a vast, rich world.

New Heaven,"1,2,3",by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9c5e6ef95969321e2a/1:1/w_160/fe0e877b.jpg,2011-06-21 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15532-new-heaven/,Frenchkiss,"It's hard enough to get a read on the evasively named Pittsburgh duo 1,2,3 before you get to its debut album, New Heaven, and it doesn't become much easier from there. Ten minutes in, ""Heat Lightnin'"" and its combination of flickered acoustic guitars, overeager stereo panning effects, and Nic Snyder's campfire-lit whispers conjure a hi-fi version of Animal Collective's embryonic Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished. Immediately afterward, there's a Raekwon namedrop over a digital dancehall beat on ""Lonesome Boring Summer"". And that's all before a true-blue C&W waltz wherein the narrator steals a soldier's sweetheart and tries to offer some sort of cold comfort by getting the poor chump to see it from his perspective. What the hell? Despite the above description, New Heaven isn't a Ween-style mock survey of the past decade's indie rock trends; 1,2,3 are too good-natured and enthusiastic for that sort of thing. Rather than dutifully checking off a to-do list, 1,2,3 select their sounds à la carte, and the strongest songs within the far-flung coordinates of New Heaven simply scan as of-the-moment. They're wise to lead off with ""Work"", where Snyder's flamboyant falsetto gives spangly frill to the sort of fists-up, surging arrangements that Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene made their stock-in-trade. With its flubbed intro and off-kilter guitar leads, ""Confetti"" has a similarly boozy appeal, but the band proves more than capable of craft and finesse on ""Wave Pool"", which acknowledges Brian Wilson's infamous fear of the ocean by applying a Beach Boys melody to a suicidal love letter. So yeah, it's pure populism down to their lyrical concerns: girls, drinking, or being broke as fuck. Snyder surveys ""the caracass of my mid-twenties"" during ""Lonesome Boring Summer"" and finds little but overlong naps and unpaid bar tabs. For a moment, 1,2,3 escape headlong into fantasia, wondering about Jack Bruce back in the record industry's days of ""golden yachts,"" (""Riding Coach"")-- but rather than put forth a tone-deaf industry lesson, he admits his complicity in stealing his share of music. New Heaven's biggest liability is how frontloaded it is. Snyder does an admirable job breaking character and adapting his vocals to a droopy barroom drawl on ""Sorry, Soldier"", but his citric tone is occasionally an awkward fit on New Heaven's slow-jamming back half, where the tempo and the melodies slack in lockstep. ""Just Like Heaven (Is Gone)"" and ""20,000 Blades"" are nice enough on their own, but they submit to a certain kind of wallflower indie rock formalism that the first half of the record merely flirts with. For a relatively new band, it's not so bad to be better at fitting in than standing out; in the case of 1,2,3, the songwriting chops are strong enough to give the impression they'll figure out how to be equally adept at both.","Pittsburgh duo's debut shows a depth and breadth of songwriting that hints at better things to come.

City Limits Volume 2,Silkie,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb05e6ef95969321e49/1:1/w_160/9beaee20.jpg,2011-06-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15547-city-limits-volume-2/,Deep Medi,"If Silkie's City Limits Volume 1 had an immediate identity, it was dubstep's more upfront tendencies dialed into a somewhat upscale frequency-- tasteful without being bland, busy without being messy. Headphone music that worked just as well filling rooms, his material had a strong sense of rhythmic pull and intricate density. And while Silkie augmented his developing sound with occasional detours into ""purple"" bass and evergreen boogie funk, what stood out was an overarching style that didn't see a mutual exclusion between cocktail-lounge ambiance and tons of wobbly bass. At times it skewed closer to the pop-gloss sophistication of late-90s UK garage than the escalating bassbin arms race of crossover dubstep. Follow-up City Limits Volume 2 isn't as immediately gratifying or revelatory-- it's a logical progression, reliability replacing novelty. But it also explores the possibility of connecting on a level simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary, right down to the decades-past pirate-radio evocations of its song titles: ""Get Up N Dance"", ""Rock Da Funk"". Repeating themes seem intent on sparking flashbacks, vivid enough to hit specific nerves but vague enough to avoid coming across as specifically derivative-- and threading together a narrative of genre developments in the process. The synth sax that drove the melody of Volume 1 track ""Beauty"" is a more prominent component here, punctuating tracks with melodic stabs that could have originated from a decade-old Locked On garage 12""-- if not a late-80s hip-house remix. ""Selva Nova"" tweaks the neo-jungle turf that its title hints at, wringing jittery force out of the old ""Amen"" break and dousing it with a choppy yet liquid 303 bassline. And whenever a voice breaches the surface, it's in a familiar form-- Rastafarian incantations (""Feel""), Roger Troutman talk-box warbles (""New York City""), or a distorted, pitched-up note or two from a rave diva (""Snowed In""). Even the synth and piano melodies that drove some of the more compelling hooks on Volume 1 sound more comfortably worn and identifiable from eras past, like the rollerskate-jam electro of ""Boogie Boy"" or the Junie Morrison-esque g-funk extrapolations in ""Lucky"". The catch is that once Silkie gets ahold of these vintage signifiers, he pushes them all the way into the red with the pedal-down immediacy of current bass music. Even with the obvious nods to dance music's past, from rave to garage, the forward-looking listener can be assured that Silkie's found a way to make his rhythms even more nuanced and multifaceted. Attempting to break down drum patterns into individual components of snares, hi-hats, and kicks will just wind up causing dizziness; some of the beats are so stuffed with counter-rhythms and jostling emphases-- even before the buildups and breakdowns shift the topography-- that it's almost easy to lose track of just how supple they are. The bass feels a bit more aggressive, too. There are some points, such as late-album tracks ""Taxi Mi Get"" and ""Only For You"", where it takes on the hissing crackle of a shorting-out amp, and others where the wobble shakes things out until rich, individual notes turn into frenetic, staccato trembles. It's bracing stuff when all the elements click-- ""Selva Nova"", the cheery prog-funky of closer ""Outlook"", and Skream collaboration ""Untitled"", which pulls off a great double-paced slow-stride/fast-scramble momentum. And if this album's status as the final City Limits installation marks the end of an early career-defining phase, it suggests a good transition for Silkie: The body of work he's put together so far proves that the man knows his roots, and he knows where to follow them.","Silkie follows up his 2009 debut with a sophomore effort that's simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary.

James Drake,Bombé and Mr. Caribbean,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbc5e6ef95969321e5c/1:1/w_160/f6725960.jpg,2011-06-21 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15556-james-drake/,self-released,"Puns work on ""The Daily Show""-- especially when there's a shamed congressman involved. But when it comes to mashups, such wordplay has lost all of its charm. In fact, a punned-out title can now act as an active deterrent for listeners. James Drake-- a half-hour mix that combines the songs and sounds of, yes, James Blake and Drake-- is an exception to the lame-name rule. This is even more impressive since the twentysomething Philadelphia producers/DJs behind it, Bombé (Tim Shaw) and Mr. Caribbean (Luis Angel Cancel), started with the title. ""Luis is constantly thinking up pun-based ideas like this,"" wrote Shaw in an e-mail, ""and the James Drake concept was just too perfect."" The match really is well-suited beyond rhyming monikers, in part because Drake and Blake are both masters at the art of loneliness. Along with his right-hand producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, Drake has perfected the after-party comedown; he's moody, he's drunk, and he desperately needs to talk to someone about about how he's getting vertigo from being at the top. Blake, of course, is a bit more elusive and introverted in his confessionals, but the core sentiment is similarly down and wary. There's not a huge gap between Blake singing, ""I don't know about my dreamin' anymore/ All that I know is I'm fallin' falin' fallin',"" and Drake's, ""What am I afraid of?/ This is supposed to be what dreams are made of."" Both artists' uneasy sense of disillusionment cuts deep. Not only did Shaw and Cancel pick a wisely like-minded duo, they treat their creation more like a DJ mix than a traditional mashup. This isn't just 30 minutes of Drake verses pasted over Blake's willowy keyboards and stuttering bass. Both music and vocals are cherry-picked from each artist, and the mix is Blake-heavy, with Drake's unmistakable hum buzzing in on only a few tracks. And even when we do hear the rapper, his voice is often slowed down or fucked up; Shaw and Cancel manipulate Drake's vocals the same way James Blake often messes with his own croon, resulting in an even more symbiotic pairing. On ""Fear Logic Freestyle"", Drake is screwed as he repeats, ""Gotta lift the doors/ Blades choppin' through the city streets/ Liquid swords""-- close your eyes tight enough and it's not hard to imagine the same passage showing up on a legit Blake release (give or take a GZA reference). It's hard to tell where Drake ends and Blake begins. The men behind James Drake also shy away from simply pimping out their subjects' hits, instead seeking more natural combinations. ""Fall for Your Man at 9 a.m."" gets its pulse from the Blake obscurity ""Give a Man a Rod"", while Drake's early mixtape collaboration with Lil Wayne, ""Ransom"", is used to backbone highlight ""Ransom Money Youth"". Shaw and Cancel also use effects and processing to smear the lines between songs, and they add a touch of original production to the mix, though, according to Shaw, ""We tried to keep it minimal as far as major edits and let the two different voices speak for themselves."" Along the way, we learn just how little difference there is between those voices; James Drake's title might be facepalm-worthy, but its execution is anything but.","Two Philly-based producers start with a pun on the names of Drake and James Blake and finish with a surprisingly effective mixtape.

Goodbye Bread,Ty Segall,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb7b1335d7bf1699fb9/1:1/w_160/b41ae482.jpg,2011-06-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/,Drag City,"Before Ty Segall recorded ""Girlfriend"", a gem from last year's Melted, he channeled sounds we don't normally associate with humans. Through polluted streams of distorted guitar, you could hear him convulse, spitting wordless sounds as a bubblegum drumbeat took hold. It was evil, it was scary, and it sounded like demons were controlling his organs and limbs. ""Girlfriend"" was a glorious blast of fuzz, here and gone in just over two minutes. It both demonstrated Segall's gift for economy as well as perfected the tone for his work since he left his Epsilons outfit to make music on his own. But Melted as a whole made loud and clear that he was capable of more than just dishing out hard-charging hooks at blazing speeds. He was uncovering an innate understanding for craft as well. In Goodbye Bread, his first full-length for Drag City, Segall has embraced singer-songwriter craft wholeheartedly. While garage rock O.G.s like the Troggs and the Stooges continue to be an influence, Segall has turned in a relatively calm effort here, choosing to downshift into slower tempos and cleaner sounds, evoking instead the work of John Lennon, Neil Young, and Marc Bolan. Heavyweights. But what makes Goodbye Bread such a success is that we get an even keener sense of what a Ty Segall song sounds like and what that means. Jay Reatard, whose wild-child persona has often been linked to Segall since the former's passing last year, proved that it takes a little more to stand out in this sphere. The same dark energy that set ""Girlfriend"" in motion can be heard here in varying forms, whether in the enormous chorus of ""My Head Explodes"" (a head-bangers delight), the wheelie-popping solo that slices through ""Comfortable Home (A True Story)"", or the sweaty, shivering verses of ""You Make The Sun Fry"". Though Goodbye Bread rarely takes a direct route, the thrill becomes much more about the ride from start to finish, than the speed or force of impact. He achieves this by playing around with notions of pace and structure, as shown by the opening title track. It's a strummy early statement that's altogether very different from what he's shared before. Segall's vocals no longer sound like they're broadcast from the bottom of a well, the guitars are warm and bright, and its melody is vibrant in a very simple, patient manner. ""California Commercial"" is a basher that plods along happily before taking flight on some tightly coordinated guitar lines in the homestretch. And take a look at the run times here and you'll see some welcome variety, too. At first listen, ""I Am With You"" seems a bit aimless over its four minutes, but the way Segall transitions from crescendo to detour to crescendo to left turn to mangy solo proves deliciously inventive upon closer listens. Goodbye Bread is filled with such rich, breathtaking moments, and Segall, who plays every instrument here, sounds as though he's savoring every part of his process. On the slightly creepy ""You Make the Sun Fry"", there's joy in how he rhymes ""love me still"" with ""your Coupe De Ville."" Same goes for the way he locks together the chiming guitar licks that carry ""I Can't Feel It"" home and the thundrous drum fills that punctuate ""My Head Explodes"". It sounds like he's having a blast, excited with every sound and riff he finds, even as he slows down to zoom in on the details.","On his first full-length for Drag City, the SF-based garage rocker slows down but doesn't mellow out while demonstrating growth as a songwriter along the way.

Realism,Shine 2009,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afaf9d034d5c69bf4759/1:1/w_160/d7fd5808.jpg,2011-06-20 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15548-realism/,Cascine,"Time-stamping the name of your group might seem counterproductive in a musical climate that clamors for all things new and exciting. Shine 2009's name is destined to date unpredictably primarily because it refers to a recent and quite unremarkable year (a quick digest includes swine flu, the birth of chillwave, and the death of Michael Jackson). But even a cursory listen to Shine 2009's Realism shows how deeply the band is committed to the allure of dated sounds. The Balearic-leaning drum breaks and keys of opener ""Graduation"" nod toward the early 1990s, and indeed that decade's pop music legacy looms large over most of the record. Wistful shades of Air France also emerge on that track, which has a pleasant collage feel with beachy ambient sounds lending a bit of texture and character. Singer Sami Suova's straight-laced vocals sound like a cross between a more lackadaisical Bernard Sumner and the slightly angelic tinge of 1990s European boybands-- ""Pray"" by Take That comes to mind here. The kitsch dynamic is even more heavily pronounced on ""So Free"", as a frozen-in-time Paula Abdul contributes backing vocals on top of Suova's blissed-out chorus. She ramps up the camp factor, almost ad-libbing on top of cheap-sounding electronic piano stabs and synth strings. As a pastiche it has a certain charm, and while it's easy to be carried away by the light-hearted fun at its core, there's a nagging feeling that Shine 2009 don't move much beyond playing dress up. The moments where the group looks to update the conversation, as on ""New Rules"", sound far more persuasive. That track in particular bounces with a hypnotically looping synth pattern and clubby drums, and it feels a little less studied. The shades of darkness in the textures and vocals in particular make for an interestingly sunburnt take on the Balearic sound. The directive of ""I'll tell you how to do it/ Get ready for the new rules"" also comes across as unexpectedly creepy in this context and makes for an oddly gripping narrative. The title track is another intriguing moment, layering a delicate, monastic chorale on top of sliced keys and what sounds like a synthesized didgeridoo. As on ""New Rules"", there are enough leftfield elements and sounds to make for an interesting and evocative collage of material. But ultimately these moments of subversion are outnumbered by Shine 2009's more hollow imitations-- the worst being ""One"", a song played way too straight, its wah-wah laced guitar and glockenspiel synth sounding like the type of tacky chillout music played in an upscale cocktail bar. Suova's unassuming voice becomes part of the malaise instead of the laid-back counterpoint it plays on the record's stronger moments. At their best Shine 2009's backward-leaning pop songs make for a lighthearted, fun listen. But the problem with the remodelled nostalgia of Realism is that it's hard to recommend it over the real thing, beyond the sensation of kitsch novelty that the record invokes. Dig any deeper and the pastiche feels a little empty; it can't hope for the kind of memories conjured up when you are caught off guard by a song you used to know and love.","Finnish duo's backward-leaning pop songs are deeply committed to the allure of dated sounds.

Twist Again,Bodies of Water,by: Stephen M.

Dramatizing a post-Rapture socialist society and featuring a song written by Christian rock wunderkind Larry Norman (unfortunately performed by the awful Fishmarket Combo), the movie is an intriguing artifact from a time when believers didn't flee from popular culture but embraced it as a vehicle for a spiritual mission. It's a sharp contrast to the 80s, when the Satanic Panic scared many Christians away from rock music, and to the 90s, when the Christian rock industry marketed itself as a message-first alternative to secular music. Bodies of Water, an L.A. outfit whose unison and harmony vocals suggest the enthusiasm of a spirited youth choir, harken back to that open-minded 70s heyday, although thankfully not to the scare tactics of A Thief in the Night. Core couple David and Meredith Metcalf pepper their songs with Biblical imagery, yet remain too enamored with pop music in all its many forms to confine themselves to any one particular genre or approach. That excitement and a sense of boundless possibilities fueled their 2007 debut, Ears Will Pop & Eyes Will Blink. Following a lackluster sophomore album on Secretly Canadian, the Metcalfs channeled a lot of their energy into ABBA-tastic side project Music Go Music. Founding members Kyle Gladden and Jessie Conklin left the group, eventually to be replaced with a revolving roster of friends, acquaintances, and onlookers. Finally, the Metcalfs built a home studio and recorded their third album, Twist Again, which they're releasing on their own Thousand Tongues label. They're also having their first child. Twist Again, then, signals a period of rededication, rebirth, and just plain birth, but its songs sound surprisingly somber and subdued. In this more restrained setting, Bodies of Water aren't quite as commanding or charming, but they compensate with more confident, nuanced songs that incorporate elements of showtunes, disco, and folk, plus mariachi fanfares and hallelujah choruses. ""Ever With Us"" juxtaposes barebones doo-wop piano with countrypolitan strings, and the stylistic friction mirrors the domestic drama of the lyrics. Standout ""Rise Up, Careful"" fits in a lengthy saxophone solo, and the curious pairing with Meredith Metcalf's mournful vocals makes for one of the best and most unexpected moments on the album. On the other hand, ""New Age Nightmare"" nearly works itself into a frenzied din but backs away. Rather than let the music go wild, Bodies of Water play it safe. Both Metcalfs remain sharply charismatic performers, but the downcast quality to Meredith's vocals, especially on ""Lights Out Forever"", is new. The woman who once yelped ecstatically to the back pews now exudes a spiritual melancholy similar to that of her husband's grainy voice. There's a newly ponderous tone to their music, too, which may stem from the lyrics: Twist Again is preoccupied with the conflict between heavenly love and earthly love. Traditionally, love of God ought to supersede romantic and musical love, yet that order is in constant flux from one song to the next*,* as Bodies of Water indulge some new musical idea or wrap their voices seductively around each other. Even if Twist Again occasionally comes across as less than rapturous, the Metcalfs' conflicts animate these songs, as though they've realized that marriage, music, and God are not only inseparable, but quite possibly all the same thing.","After lineup changes and a side project, Music Go Music, the spirited L.A. band's third album signals a rebirth, but it's surprisingly somber and subdued.

Fiend Without a Face/West End Motel,Brent Hinds,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af90b1335d7bf1699f71/1:1/w_160/83d80930.jpg,2011-06-20 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15521-fiend-without-a-facewest-end-motel/,Rocket Science,"Of all the members of metal gods Mastodon, Brent Hinds is the guy who looks most like a bloodthirsty Viking, which is saying something given the rest of the band's appearances. He also seems like an agreeably silly and approachable goofball who just likes to play. (Let us not forget his recent appearance in a burrito commercial.) That not-taking-yourself-too-seriously side is what comes across here. Fiend Without a Face and West End Motel are two of the guitarist/vocalist's outside projects, one newish and one long-running, packaged here together as a value-priced two-fer. But if you fell in love with Mastodon's early, raw blood-and-thunder, or got on board with their more recent cosmic-scale prog-metal epics, know that you won't be getting much of either here. Though Fiend Without a Face opens with a spazzy blast of guitar and some unhinged shrieking on ""Calypso"", it sounds more like early Meat Puppets-meet-QOTSA than your average horn-throwing extreme act. The rest of the album ventures into places even more surprising-- sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes heart-on-sleeve sad-- given Hinds' rep as a glowering shredder. Anyone with a full-time band, especially one as musically demanding as Mastodon, who still has the energy to spearhead two other groups has to be a little musically restless and prone to compulsive songwriting. Hinds indulges here, stretching wildly across parched desert-rock boogie, down-and-out country, even (whisper it) sprightly indie-ish guitar pop. There's a playfulness to both bands' material, especially the occasional deranged vocalizing and overall jamming vibe, but things never (or mostly never) stray into sloppiness. If anything, what unites the music here, at least the Fiend Without a Face material, is Hinds' manic virtuoso guitar playing. But instead of Priest theatrics or Sabbath crunch, we get a guitar that veers between rockabilly at warp-speed, surf music stripped of kitsch, 1960s chase-scene scores, and amphetamine-grade country jangle. ""Tsunami"" even reminds me of the bright, jittery sound of the early Feelies. It's not all grins and crazy rhythms, though. The latter-half, especially the off-brand Tom Waits barroom lament ""Under My Skin"", hews closer to country's crying-on-the-floor side, and ""She's on Fire"" is just plain pretty alt-rock. This record is in no way a Crack the Skye-style statement; its off-the-cuff amiability will probably be off-putting to as many Mastodon heads as it is charming. It sounds like a lark, especially if you're expecting metal's cathartic roar, but even so, it's an undeniably fun lark.","Mastodon guitarist's two outside projects, one newish and one long-running, are packaged here together as a value-priced two-fer.

Dr. Lecter,Action Bronson,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af74ea9e61561daa6462/1:1/w_160/69330d2e.jpg,2011-06-20 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15497-dr-lecter/,Fine Fabric Delegates,"In any discussion about the new-on-the-scene Queens rapper Action Bronson, two things inevitably come up: (1) He sounds a whole hell of a lot like Ghostface Killah, and (2) he loves rapping about food. Both of these things are entirely true. Like Ghost, he's got a pinched, high-pitched, urgent delivery, rendering his boasts in a dense, inventive New York slur that moves from one idea to the next with necksnap immediacy. He's not a rip-off artist; he's got none of Ghost's emotional streak and little of his vividly violent storytelling impulse. But the mere grain of his voice is similar enough to provoke the momentary sensation every time a new verse starts that you're actually hearing Ghostface. Similarly, the food fixation is no invention. In a recent web interview, Bronson claims he hopes his rap career can bankroll his culinary studies in Tuscany. And even ""Ronnie Coleman"", the song where he laments his weight and lack of impulse control, has enough impassioned food descriptions to make you seriously hungry: ""An hour later, eat the burger with my drug dealer/ Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer."" Bronson raps about food with the same loving linguistic dizziness that Pusha T raps with about cocaine, or that Lil Wayne raps with about blowjobs. But even though both the Ghostface and the food talking points hold true, they don't really get to the bottom of what makes Dr. Lecter, Bronson's debut album, such a breath of fresh air. Simply put, Dr. Lecter is a rock-solid, ridiculously fun New York rap album, one that recalls the city's past glories without ever feeling like an act of stylistic exhumation. All the tracks on the LP come from one producer, the heretofore unknown Tommy Mas, whose style would've fit the late-80s classics of Marley Marl and the Juice Crew but maintains a crispness and energy that we rarely hear in retro-rap. Mas chops up breakbeats and soul samples, all the while keeping his sound simple, sparse, and funkier than any recent hip-hop. And Bronson attacks every one of his tracks, delivering quick bursts of streetcorner shit-talk, having too much fun to take himself seriously. Bronson's lyrics can be ignorant as fuck (""Take a dyke on a date/ She let me pipe cuz I'm an ape""), but he doesn't have the nihilistic edge of an Odd Future affiliate. He's just kicking silly bullshit, and it's tough to imagine anyone seriously getting offended. Maybe the greatest thing about Dr. Lecter is how the album never announces itself as some triumphant return of New York rap. Bronson never claims to be the savior of anything; he just belts out his punchlines and then disappears. Songs typically don't have choruses, and the album's 15 tracks end in less than 45 minutes. Bronson names songs after relatively marginal figures: perennial WWF jobber Barry Horowitz, 90s NBA journeyman Chuck Person, 60s/70s football great Larry Csonka. A few guests show up, but none of them are big names. And though the two rappers' styles are radically different, Dr. Lecter calls up memories of Marcberg, the great and underrated 2010 album from fellow New York shit-talker Roc Marciano. Like that LP, Dr. Lecter doesn't try to break any ground; it just does a long-established style very, very well.","Up-and-coming Queens rapper releases a rock-solid, ridiculously fun album that recalls the past glories of New York rap without feeling derivative.

Bon Iver,Bon Iver,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb313d197565213a317/1:1/w_160/d44901b5.jpg,2011-06-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/,Jagjaguwar4AD,"The guy who recorded an album alone in the woods. This line might end up on Justin Vernon's tombstone. There's something irresistible about the thought of a bearded dude from small-town Wisconsin retreating, heartbroken, to a cabin to write some songs-- especially when the result is a record that sounds as hushed and introspective as Bon Iver's 2007 debut, For Emma, Forever Ago. These days, Vernon is more likely to poke fun at the image, but it endures because it fulfils a fantasy for us as listeners. Even if we don't care for the outdoors, most of us occasionally want to escape our lives, be alone with our thoughts, and see if we can tap into something true. In a time of easy distraction, the idea of heading into a cabin at the edge of the world to create is alluring. By tying the intimacy of that image to Justin Vernon's music, we're able to take the trip with him. Since that album's release, Vernon's approach to writing and recording has changed. ""I don't find inspiration by just sitting down with a guitar anymore,"" he recently told Pitchfork. ""I wanted to build a sound from scratch and then use that sound to make the song."" That difference is clear on Bon Iver. Instead of something that scans as ""folk,"" the music here is more like rustic chamber pop with an experimental edge that makes careful use of arrangement and dynamics. And rather than being tied together by a central theme of loss, Vernon has fully shifted into a more impressionistic mode; these songs are broader and more musically sophisticated than those on For Emma at every turn. But the thread between this album and its comparatively skeletal predecessor is Vernon's voice, an instrument that feels warm and personal and close regardless of setting. Now that we've heard him singing hooks with Kanye West and taking the lead with Gayngs on songs that touch on R&B and soft rock, the general sphere of Vernon's voice is clear. He simultaneously evokes the grain and expression of soul music along with the mythological echoes of folk. But more importantly, no one else sounds like him. The Beach Boys have been the primary touchstone for layered vocals in indie music for years, but Vernon's timbre comes from somewhere else entirely. Where ""Beach Boys harmonies"" have a spiritual undercurrent that brings to mind a choirboy's dream of perfection, Vernon sounds like a man who has outgrown such ideas. His voice is earthy and wounded and, despite his astonishing upper register, not something you would describe as ""angelic."" ""Holocene"" contains one of this album's many virtuosic vocal performances. ""Part of me, apart from me,"" Vernon sings early on, and those six words hold a lot. The evocative nature of his diction is apparent even in a simple line like ""I was not magnificent."" He sounds centered and clear while taking stock and allowing memories to be mixed in with the details of the present. His conflicted vocals trigger a half-dozen feelings all at once before releasing the tension with a refrain that finds the fleeting moment where the world seems right: ""I could see for miles, miles, miles."" Vernon posted Bon Iver's lyrics shortly after the album leaked last month, but they're not easy to parse-- the storytelling here is oblique. But there are connections. The song titles reference actual places (""Calgary"") and places that sound real, but aren't (""Hinnom, TX"", ""Michicant""); they're less about geography and more about putting a name to a state of mind that mixes clarity and surrealism. And the deeper you sink into these tracks, the harder it becomes to extract specifics. One recurring element is intoxication-- lines about being drunk or high that come with recounted details. Which makes sense, because the album deals with escape and the struggle to get outside yourself. The narrator takes in what's around him, mixing those thoughts with memories of where he's been. Sometimes the lines have a startling specificity (""Third and Lake it burnt away, the hallway/ Was where we learned to celebrate,"" on ""Holocene"") and sometimes they contain words that seem to function more as sound (""fide"" or ""fane"" on ""Perth""). Throughout, there's a strong sense of an observer taking things in and processing confusing images, trying to figure out what can be learned. If you caught Vernon live after For Emma, you gradually saw him putting more and more emphasis on his band, moving Bon Iver from that solitary project into something that felt more like the work of a group. And Bon Iver, with its rich and layered arrangements, extends that development in a striking direction that's both logical and surprising. Blending natural instrumentation supplied by recruited players-- such as string arranger Rob Moose (Antony and the Johnsons, the National, Arcade Fire) and a horn/woodwind section that includes versatile saxophonist Colin Stetson-- with an array of electronic and treated sounds, the album combines varied textures in ways that are ambitious and unusual but often subtle enough to miss on first glance. At points, Bon Iver draws on the experiments of Volcano Choir, Vernon's side project with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees (members from that group play on the album). Freed from conventional verse/chorus/bridge/chorus structure, the songs become more like tone poems, patient explorations of moods that proceed deliberately but unpredictably. The holistic style is evident on opener ""Perth"", which builds from total silence into a crashing peak over the course of four short minutes. And there's an uncanny moment on the breathtaking ""Michicant"", a song in part about childhood, where a bicycle bell rings twice, pulling you deeper into Vernon's reverie. It's a simple, brief effect, but it's indicative of how the album uses elemental sounds in unexpected ways. Vernon has taken that voice, and these arrangements, and crafted an album that unfolds like a suite. The structure is flawless right up to its conclusion, ""Beth/Rest"", which has been much remarked upon for its unabashed and unironic embrace of 80s adult contemporary pop sounds. If you've spent any time in the vicinity of a radio tuned to light rock, you hear the keyboard tone that opens the song and you think Lionel Richie, Richard Marx, and ""No One Is to Blame"". It's almost naive of Vernon to think he could pull this off. Yet, heard in context, it stands as one the record's bravest and most deftly executed moments-- not just because it lays bare Vernon's stated admiration for artists like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby, but because it's executed to perfection. And while the production attempts to wring something new from a long-maligned sound, the song and voice remain true to Bon Iver as an idea. As a closer, ""Beth/Rest"" is more about finding comfort and resolution after a musical experience that asked more questions than it answered. The song draws a line in the sand for anyone with a deep investment in cool, and Vernon stands behind it with confidence. His belief in himself and in the power of his music is something that encourages us to transcend labels and preconceptions. After the closeness and austerity of For Emma, Vernon has given us a knotty record that resists easy interpretation but is no less warm or welcoming. You can feel it even as you don't completely understand it-- a testament to its careful construction and Vernon's belief in the power of music to convey deeper meaning. It's a rare thing for an album to have such a strong sense of what it wants to be. Bon Iver is about flow, from one scene and arrangement and song and memory and word into the next-- each distinct but connected-- all leading to ""Beth/Rest"". On the way there, the music moves like a river, every bend both unpredictable and inevitable as it carves sound and emotion out of silence.","Justin's Vernon's project started out low-key and largely solo but has grown into an expansive and ambitious full-band affair with brilliant results.

In Vogue Spirit,Wet Hair,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af97ea9e61561daa649e/1:1/w_160/d172bdab.jpg,2011-06-17 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15528-in-vogue-spirit/,De Stijl,"Wet Hair have a long and long-winded history as some of the Midwest's reigning vibe merchants. The Iowa City duo's members-- percussionist Ryan Garbes and keyboardist/vocalist Shawn Reed-- used to play in Raccoo-oo-oon, a sorely missed noise-rock group that released three records and a handful of rambling, live-to-tape jam sessions before disbanding in 2008. Since then, Reed in particular has established a heavy underground presence, both through his Night People label (Peaking Lights, Dirty Beaches, Pocahaunted) and his hieroglyphic-style visual art. Where Raccoo-oo-oon went heavy on spastic syncopation and post-punk guitar skree, Wet Hair have followed a mellower path. By patching rinky-dink synths through a bevy of effects, they work up vintage krautrock haze on a DIY budget. The band's two albums have been heavy with luxuriant lo-fi drones and unhurried eight-minute bliss-outs. This time around, they've opted to rein in the jams a little. Wet Hair's third LP, In Vogue Spirit, is its most straightforward batch of songs yet. Garbes and Reed temper their open-ended improv with the traditional stuff of rock: guitar riffs, deep bottom end, and propulsive rhythms. Album opener ""Echo Lady"" flows forward at full speed, powered by fuzz-bass and motorik percussion beneath a wall of dizzying keyboard textures. It's In Vogue Spirit's immediate, head-bobbing moment. After that, things only get weirder. On ""Tarantula"", a web of interlocking melodies spins over the distant rattle of a junk-shop drum machine. Reed delivers his lyrics in a cool-headed, Alan Vega-worthy whisper, which is then further obscured by a cloud of echo. In their previous output, Garbes and Reed took heavy inspiration from the German electronic psychedelic music of the 1960s and 70s, but added a layer of ear-scorching grit inherited from the mid-00s noise scene. On In Vogue Spirit, their reference points have drifted toward the dreamy pop moves of Silver Apples and Spacemen 3, as well as contemporary psych-droners like Moon Duo and Sun Araw. The headier compositions, ""Liquid Jesus"" and ""Cosmic Radio"", forgo distortion in favor of lush and dreamy texture. In both Raccoo-oo-oon and Wet Hair, Garbes and Reed have been uncompromising in their pursuit of the outer limits. They set up a table full of banged-up doodads, set the controls for the heart of the sun, and let it rip. That hasn't changed. But with In Vogue Spirit, Garbes and Reed have delivered a more consistent, considered record. Space is still the place, but they've found shortcuts to getting there.","On third album, Iowa noise-psych vets (formerly of Raccoo-oo-oon) temper their open-ended improv with the traditional stuff of rock.

Country Stash / What I Became,MV & EEMatt Valentine,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9e5e6ef95969321e2d/1:1/w_160/a66bdf58.jpeg,2011-06-17 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15533-country-stash-what-i-became/,Three Lobed,"By necessity, any conversation about the music of Matt Valentine (MV) and Erika Elder (EE) is eventually going to touch on their prolific output. The Vermont duo's constant production has simply become one of its defining facts. In addition to a steady stream of studio albums for Ecstatic Peace!, MV & EE have continued to release small-batch recordings on their own Child of Microtones label, including a Dick's Picks-style series of live recordings on the offshoot Heroine Celestial Agriculture subsidiary. Over the course of this massive discography, MV & EE's music has ranged through overlapping regions of pastoral psych-folk, cosmic country and blues, and expansive, Crazy Horse-inspired guitar jams that occasionally cozy up against what was once known as grunge. As with many such prolific acts, the duo's work can strike a balance between the deeply rewarding and the exasperating, as each listener is bound to choose a favorite from among the different aspects of their sound. When fatigue sets in, there seems to be little harm in sitting out a few albums and waiting for them to cycle back around again. MV & EE have now rewarded such patience with two fine new studio albums, Country Stash and What I Became, the latter of which is nominally a Matt Valentine solo album. On each album, the musicians have drawn in the fences just enough to sharpen their focus on a specific portion of their overall sound. Longtime fans will find much to savor on both albums, or, failing that, will almost certainly fall heavily for one or the other. It might sound strange to call an album that features multiple nine-plus-minute jams ""restrained,"" but that nevertheless is how Country Stash can feel. Despite the extended guitar solos, the album is one of MV & EE's most tuneful and song-oriented collections to date, and their most immediately likable since 2006's Green Blues. Not too surprisingly, the duo has found a kindred spirit in Woods' Jeremy Earl, who contributes harmony vocals on ""Foxy One"" and ""Crash Palace of Records"". And though MV & EE have never been prone to creating the type of melodic hooks that actually prove hummable, both of these tracks have the amiable spirit and loose-limbed energy that are familiar features on Woods records. MV & EE's albums have frequently benefitted from guest appearances, including such notables as J Mascis and Sunburned Hand of the Man's John Moloney. Country Stash features perhaps their most unlikely collaborator yet in Andy Ramsay, best known for his work with Stereolab and the High Llamas. Ramsay's high-precision style seems a counterintuitive match for MV & EE's improvisational wandering. But the pairing works surprisingly well, with Ramsay providing atmospheric electronics, percussion, and production for ""Tea Devil"" and ""No There, There"". ""Tea Devil"", which has appeared on at least one previous MV & EE release in a different form, is here rendered with a brooding, ominous pulse, as Elder delivers a smoldering vocal performance to craft an instant highlight in the group's catalog. Matt Valentine takes a largely different approach on What I Became. The album's solo billing is a little misleading: Elder contributes vocals to one track and Jeremy Earl adds percussion in several places, while throughout MV applies a delicate lacing of acoustic and electric guitar overdubs. In other words, this release doesn't seem that different from a proper MV & EE album, and it achieves a sound that is more introspective than solitary. It is, however, one of Valentine's more folk-oriented albums in a good while, and it should be a welcome sight for those who've been missing that side of his playing. On refreshing opener ""Continuing the Good Life"", Valentine offers a reminder of what an expert acoustic picker he can be. On such tracks as ""PK Dick"" or ""Ave. B"", the electric and acoustic instruments seem to descend upon the same spot from opposite directions, illuminating the songs in hazy silhouette. Valentine's effects-heavy vocals tend to shy from the spotlight without Elder there for assistance; his voice often seems there as much to provide an atmospheric backdrop as to deliver his whispery lyrics. Both albums have been issued in nice-looking vinyl editions, which is fitting. For as many cassettes and CD-Rs as MV & EE have released, the immersive qualities of vinyl make it a natural format for the duo. Pressed in limited runs, these albums might prove a little more difficult to track down, but by now MV & EE fans should be used to exercising patience.","Prolific Vermont duo rewards fans' patience with two new studio albums, featuring guests Jeremy Earl (Woods) and Andy Ramsay (Stereolab, High Llamas).

Plantation,Arrange,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa0c0084474cd0c1ae7/1:1/w_160/3a27d16d.jpg,2011-06-17 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15534-plantation/,self-released,"""Still can't feel much of anything,"" Malcom Lacey sings on ""Tearing Up Old Asphalt"", a slow-burner from the South Floridian's first LP as Arrange, Plantation. With his soft voice awash in electronic hums and next to a tranquil piano line, you can almost believe him. But the claim seems mostly aspirational. His unassuming vocals quiver and crack with emotion, giving the impression not of a person who can't feel, but of one who must be cautious of feeling too much. That's a common symptom of being a teenager, which Lacey is. So it's extra-impressive that Plantation never goes over the top. Instead, this highly personalized fusion of dark indie-pop and laptop ambient taps into volatile wellsprings of longing, resentment, and fear with controlled intensity. Plantation is very much a bedroom production. Often using either a cloud of tone or a simple piano figure as a base, Lacey fashions understated, compact hooks from guitar, vocal loops, and software synthesizers, and then rolls them out for just long enough to lodge them in memory before they vanish. As mentioned in a Playlist review of ""When'd You Find Me?"", Bright Eyes might wind up with something like Plantation if he judiciously added vocals to a Kompakt Pop Ambient sampler. But Lacey's vision is unique, and makes the album cohesive despite its piecemeal diversity. Many different touchstones flow into one retiring mood. Opening instrumental ""In Old Theaters"" has the stately drive of M83. The standout ""Tiny Little Boy"" nods to R&B with splashy mechanical drums and a soulfully lilting vocal performance. A techno influence becomes more pronounced in the back half: On ""Blinds with You"", a droning synth line soars and slumps with weary majesty over crisply staggered drums, and ""Veins"" owes an unabashed debt to the Field's slithering pulses. The blurry melodies of chillwave, the drafty space of dubstep, and the hypnotic repetitions of classical minimalism are all contextual influences. But everything blends into a unified voice thanks to Lacey's knack for thoughtful connective tissue and striking lyrical point of view. This is thoroughly a break-up record, but Lacey deals in implication and austerity. His perspective has a mature balance: He makes accusations that cut both ways, and then he questions them. We get not just the wounded heart and its grudges but the filter of the skeptical mind, watching from a critical distance. *Plantation'*s recording quality is a little uneven, but that seems a small price to pay for the genuine intimacy that can occur when a young person holes up in a bedroom with a computer, a guitar, and his complex sorrow, figuring out on his own what can be made of it all.","This promising self-released record from a young singer-songwriter mixes grim and emotional songwriting with expansive electronic production.

Archives Performance Series Vol. 9: A Treasure,Neil YoungInternational Harvesters,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa2ea9e61561daa64ae/1:1/w_160/bf8e6aba.jpg,2011-06-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15535-archives-performance-series-vol-9-a-treasure/,Reprise,"Neil Young spent the 1980s making more headlines than hits. He defended Ronald Reagan in interviews, skewered Pepsi and Budweiser in a video banned by MTV, and fought off lawsuits from his label, Geffen, over a string of stylistically divergent albums. One of these was Old Ways, a traditional-country throwback that wasn't too many cornfields removed from Young's star-making 1972 release, Harvest. After some twists and turns that included 1982's synth-pop transgression Trans and 1983's goofy 50s rock homage Everybody's Rockin', a radically revamped Old Ways eventually came out in 1985, between a couple of tours backed by a crack live band of country-music veterans called the International Harvesters. This short-lived group included longtime Young collaborators Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, and Tim Drummond. The International Harvesters may not hold the same exalted status in the Neil Young story as Crazy Horse or the Stray Gators, but they get their proper due on the latest installment of Young's Archives Performance Series, which continues to defy all laws of chronology and numerical order. (A Treasure, the sixth set released in the series, is classified as Volume 9; it follows 2009's Dreamin' Man Live '92, aka Volume 12.) So far, the Archives Performance Series has mostly featured embryonic performances of what would become Young's best-known work; A Treasure is the first entry to put the spotlight on a less celebrated stretch of his career. As such, this choppy compilation of Harvesters tour highlights allows us to reassess some of Young's 80s output outside its contentious context. Among all of Young's 80s genre exercises, the Harvesters country detour was the most musically in tune with his canonical turn-of-the-70s work. But Young shot that music through with a persona every bit as calculated as the skinny-tied humanoid heard on Trans, or the ersatz Elvis seen on the cover of Everybody's Rockin'. For the Harvesters tour, Young wasn't so much playing country music as playing the role of a country-music singer: taking the stage in a Harley-Davidson ballcap, spouting over-the-top pro-America rhetoric in the press, and booking the band to play state fairs, rodeos, and variety TV shows instead of the usual big-market concert halls. Only Young knows how genuine his new image really was, but the recordings on A Treasury capture a very real desire to leave behind Geffen-- and the increasingly corporatized rock world-- by taking refuge in the heartland. Helped by the frenzied fiddling of Rufus Thibodeaux, the Harvesters transform Harvest warhorse ""Are You Ready for the Country"" from FM-radio road-trip anthem into an advertising jingle for their own Nashville-bound sound. (Yes, Old Ways' ""Get Back to the Country"" is included here, too.) And if Young's label and old fans were frustrated by his Music City makeover, the middle American audience ate it up. Auto-industry address ""Motor City"", from 1981's Re-ac-tor, may have originally been written in cranky character, but on A Treasure, an enthusiastic crowd receives its made-in-the-U.S.A. boosterism as gospel. However, unlike previous Archives Performance Series issues, A Treasure's set list pulls from a diverse, career-spanning range of sources. The collection stands less as a specific document of an elaborate ""fuck you"" directed at Geffen and more as a testament to Young's undiminished reputation as a fiery, inventive live performer-- even when he was releasing the weakest albums of his career. The standouts here are a pair of reworked obscurities: a gorgeous rendition of the Buffalo Springfield chestnut ""Flying on the Ground Is Wrong"" (written by Young but originally sung by Richie Furay) and a show-stopping charge through ""Southern Pacific"" that upgrades the Re-ac-tor version's sluggish boogie into a banjo-powered barn-burner. A Treasure also boasts five previously unreleased tracks. Some of them could have easily been left in the bootleg bin, such as the cheeky tear-in-my-beer ballad ""Let Your Fingers Do the Walking"" and swinger ""Soul of a Woman"", which predicts later Young band Bluenotes. But others handily transcend the datedness of so much 80s Neil. The sweet serenades ""Amber Jean"" and ""Nothing Is Perfect"", for instance, could sit comfortably among the timeless, low-key classics on 1978's Comes a Time, while the closing rager ""Grey Riders"" anticipates 1989 return-to-form Freedom. All of which suggest that Young's greatest affront to Geffen in the 80s wasn't making subpar, ""unrepresentative"" albums. It was not giving the label the satisfaction of releasing his better efforts from the era.","The first Archives Performance Series entry to feature a less celebrated stretch of Young's career rescues his mid-80s country phase from its context.

Over a muted beat and a quiet circular guitar line, Nadler again pines for a lover who's left, something she's done about as well as any young American songwriter during the last decade. ""Cobalt and sea, come back to me,"" she sings, her loneliness delivered like a ghost's whisper. ""I'll never do you wrong."" But 90 seconds in, ""Puppet Master"" takes an unexpected turn, adding vibraphone and transitioning to a near-waltz that suggests the Ronnettes, just slowed and simplified. Nadler's experience sublimates into a puppet's innocence: ""Lately, all I want is you,"" she offers, sweetly and almost cheerily. ""Puppet master, see me through."" Nadler volleys between mourning and flirting on ""Puppet Master"", the centerpiece of her first album for own label, Box of Cedar. It's a telling move, too: Her looks at love have grown increasingly intricate, subtle and-- most importantly-- realistic since her 2004 debut. Her songs are now much too considered to be only elegiac, too complex to be simply sad. That idea translates musically as well. Just like ""Puppet Master"", the best songs here make slight and unexpected detours. With the help of producer Brian McTear, the songs fit together naturally; whether above synthesizers or acoustic guitar, Nadler never sounds forced. ""In Your Lair, Bear"", for instance, is an opening masterstroke, a bold six-minute move that patiently rises over its duration. Drums, strings, electric guitars, and harmonies enter and exit in turn; Nadler's two characters use each other, seasonally wearing one another like amulets or accessories. ""I took you home, and I crashed you,"" she sings at the end, subverting her general role as the one demolished by love. She assumes the power just to admit she's abused it. Nadler's songs are frank, careful examinations of all the ways a relationship can grow cold. Her music sounds as somber as ever here, and her distant air remains one of the most absolutely haunting things you're likely to find anywhere near indie rock. But she's grown past solipsism to become more of a reporter on the battles she's seen. During ""Alabaster Queen"", she admits giving over to a someone who is nothing but trouble, excusing the ""women wistful wanting"" with a deliberateness that foretells how badly this will all end. For the emotional minefield ""Baby I Will Leave You in the Morning"", Nadler's protagonist preemptively asks for forgiveness before she hits the road, where she'll drink to sleep-- most likely, with another lover. She doesn't blame the despair of the gorgeously pained ""Wind Up Doll"" on the dead husband, and she doesn't badmouth the lover who doesn't reciprocate her eternal, exhausting feelings during ""Wedding"". She just shares those stories in songs that are as gorgeous as they are elliptical and intriguing. Nadler's diligently expanded her reach as a writer and arranger during the past decade, culminating so far in the expansive sounds of 2009's Little Hells and the subtly twisting forms of this new eponymous album. But she's part of that caste of American songwriters who don't make music grand enough to be Joanna Newsom or Bon Iver, brazen enough to be Fleet Foxes. Rather, her contemporaries might be considered Richard Buckner, Doug Paisley, Alela Diane, and Bill Callahan-- really good songwriters who can get lost in the current indie climate, or, as Mike Powell wrote about Callahan earlier this year, folks who might ""have nothing to add to the general conversation about music in 2011."" These are writers sitting on terrific strings of records, yet remaining relatively unnoticed. Once again, though, Nadler has maintained and etched out yet another album of cold, stony truths about the ways we love, or fail to.","On her first album for her new label, the subtly devastating singer-songwriter continues her dark exploration of love and loss.

7,Puerto Rico Flowers,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afadea9e61561daa64bd/1:1/w_160/0ce54b4e.jpg,2011-06-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15542-7/,Fan Death,"It's too bad that the final Clockcleaner record, 2010's Auf Wiedersehen, was so short and so overlooked, because it was a bit of a revelation. Over four songs, the Philly band's dark noise-rock, which had echoed bands like the Birthday Party, Butthole Surfers, and Killdozer, moved into catchier territory with surprising ease. Particularly impressive was singer John Sharkey III's shift to a more melodic bellow. He had hinted at this before, but his Ian Curtis-ish baritone seemed bigger and bolder. Sharkey's solo project, Puerto Rico Flowers, creeps a couple of steps further from Clockcleaner, trading that band's guitar spew for soaring synths and big bass lines, and replacing punk speed with lurching mid-tempos. In the process, Sharkey approaches the dramatic 1980s goth-pop of Bauhaus, the Cure, and Depeche Mode. (The man himself says PRF ""has more in common with Journey than any fucking cold wave band,"" but his hilarious interviews always have to be taken with a pound of salt). *7'*s best song, ""3 Sisters"", could pass for a cover of the Cure's ""Fascination Street"", borrowing that song's stair-climbing bass and rolling drumbeat. But the pulse is insistent, and Sharkey's vocals (as well as his dreamy lyrics, a contrast to Clockcleaner's brutal verses) are entrancing, helping the tune avoid full-on mimicry through sheer force of will. That's actually a fair way to describe the rest of 7. Sharkey leans hard into all seven tracks-- many of which march beyond the six-minute mark-- and fills them with compelling torque that only hard-earned musical muscles can muster. So while every moment sits squarely in goth-pop mode, and each song could be compared pretty quickly to a band that was in its prime 25 years ago, Sharkey never lets you forget he's behind the wheel. The catch is you have to like the way he drives and the retro roads he's traversing. It's hard to imagine 7 grabbing anyone who doesn't dig both. Still, it's easy to get caught by Sharkey's hooks, especially during the final three cuts, a kind of enchanting mini-suite. The heavy float of ""Freezing Tears""-- ""Why am I freezing?"" Sharkey sings like Ian Curtis in ballad mode-- curves into the punching ""Keep Me Around"", then cascades into the beat-less closer ""After the Weekend"". That final track is the kind that lots of 80s records ended with-- a mopey meditation, complete with sad piano, that carries the album off into the fog. It's a nice fog to get lost in, but hopefully Sharkey will return with something less drenched in the past next time around.","Ex-Clockcleaner singer John Sharkey III's solo project trades guitar spew for soaring synths, approaching the dramatic 1980s goth-pop of Bauhaus and the Cure.

Change Is Gradual,Processory,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af89c0084474cd0c1abc/1:1/w_160/8099a402.jpg,2011-06-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15515-change-is-gradual/,Sugarcane,"Finland's Jori Hulkkonen and Jerry Valuri come from a long line of electronic musicians who, instead of focusing on either dance or experimental music, choose to put more emphasis on using traditional structures to craft dream-lit pop songs. On Change Is Gradual, their second full-length release as Processory, Hulkkonen and Valuri are among a growing faction of revivalists taking their cues from the new romantic pop music of the 1980s. Processory's approach may be more straightforward, but like contemporaries the Tough Alliance, the goal is to write solid, accessible songs with an unusual bent, no matter what tools are at their disposal. There's something wonderfully familiar about these songs; you could swear that any number of subtle synth hooks and vocal turns have been patched-in from some reimagined Tears For Fears or Spandau Ballet track. Dramatic, distant and oddly sexual, Change Is Gradual sounds like a surrogate soundtrack to The Breakfast Club if Ally Sheedy's character were the only member. And yet, there's something very current in the touchstones the duo uses to get its point across. Drums sound suspended in a viscous liquid, Hulkkonen's vocals feel specter-like, and helium-tuned synths and celestial atmospherics rise and fall with a scope reminiscent of M83. But for all the retro touches, there are moments that feel positively futuristic-- for starters, the tellingly titled ""Human, Unfortunately"", which sounds like Sade for replicants, and ""Farewell, Welfare"", which features the booming voice of Big Brother monotonically rattling off a number of societal ills. The pair of songs that conclude the record (""In the Unlikely Event of an All Life Erasing Gamma-Ray Burst, This Is the Soundtrack"" and ""Adaptation For Survival"") give off an apocalyptic vibe that's also transportative: for all the earthbound carnality and desperation that floods the album, this strange final cosmic arc somehow manages to take you somewhere very far away. Still, you could probably attribute all this head-tripping to the giddy exhaustion felt from listening to the whole thing in one sitting. Change Is Gradual is nearly as long as a feature film, and there's no getting around the fact that it can be daunting. But Hulkkonen and Valuri do their best to break up the frozen detachment, offering a few groove-centric detours. ""Take Me to Your Leader"" is a smoky, Balearic-tinged body-rocker, and ""Recovery Measures"" glides and jukes with an appealing foreignness. As if that weren't enough, Change Is Gradual comes supported by three separate EPs, featuring remixes from heavy-hitters like Hercules and Love Affair, CFCF, and Aeroplane. The result is yet another full hour of music. Fortunately, the reinterpretations here add needed bounce while still honoring the chilled minimalism of the originals. Hannulelauri makes the most of the opportunity, putting up a remix and a dub of highlight ""Recovery Measures"" that are both faithful yet movement-minded; for pure batty fun, Pink Skull's funk-struck take on ""Take Me to Your Leader"" is the real keeper. Needless to say, Change Is Gradual-- not to mention the extras-- is a lot to digest, and it sometimes feels as if all this music has just mushed together in your brain. But Processory's ambition and hard work ultimately trumps the album's exhaustive length.","On their second LP, Processory are among a growing faction of revivalists taking cues from the new romantic pop music of the 1980s.

Don't Blame the Stars,The Black Swans,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa85e6ef95969321e39/1:1/w_160/de90f1d4.jpg,2011-06-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15543-dont-blame-the-stars/,Misra,"The Black Swans' violinist Noel Sayre died in a swimming accident in July of 2008, three months after his band had gathered in an Ohio garage to begin recording their new LP, Don't Blame the Stars. The group set aside the unfinished Stars sessions in the wake of Sayre's passing, putting together last year's limited-edition Words Are Stupid before returning to the project. Which makes sense, as hearing Sayre's mournful bow work while still grieving for the man himself might've been too much, too soon. Sayre's rippling violin, echoing and amplifying frontman Jerry DeCicca's pitch-black lyrics, was key to the sound of the Black Swans, and Don't Blame the Stars proves a fine showcase for their late bandmate. But it's also a testament to the Swans' adaptability, both as a band of survivors and an ever-changing musical unit. With its spacious pick-up arrangements and occasional shaggy-dog spoken word interludes (a tribute of sorts to Willie Nelson's Yesterday's Wine), Don't Blame the Stars is perhaps the closest the Swans have come to a straight-up country record. The gothic smear that sat underneath 2007's Change! is largely gone, and while the stripped-back remnants aren't exactly Bakersfield smooth, much of it lands somewhere between, say, Nashville Skyline and early-70s outlaw. The playing is stellar, if sparse, with apt but unobtrusive accoutrement; they leave that to Sayre, whose violin winds and weaves through much of the empty space left by DeCicca's halting delivery. It's a gorgeous sounding record, its live-in-a-room feel and tastefully-employed vintage flourishes-- the reverb-heavy guitar under its title track, the chug of the barely-there background vocals in ""I Forgot to Change the Windshield Wipers in My Mind""-- lending it the same gentle charms of a beat-up gem from the C&W bin. As ever, it's the weary bemusement of DeCicca's lyrics that really sets Don't Blame the Stars apart. He begins the ""woe is me"" crisis of ""Boo Hoo"" with a bit about getting buggered by a clown; later he loses a lover in plain sight, eats cold soup, and rationalizes his way through another drink. DeCicca seems to be toying with country conventions here-- especially the earnest-seeming spoken word stuff-- but there's a deep tradition-steeped reverence to it as well. What seems a bit staid and straightforward at first reveals a subtle richness over time. DeCicca's delivery, alternately grim and genial, sometimes averages out into nonchalance, and some of the black humor in these lyrics is a bit funnier on paper than on the record itself. But he's always been sort of a tricky read as a singer, allowing Sayre's ever-present violin to hammer home the emotional content, and Don't Blame the Stars finds the two neatly complementing one another. When, on ""My Brother"", a sweetly descending string part wraps around DeCicca's sigh of ""can't forget what we've been through,"" it's devastating, but quietly so. So, too, is Don't Blame the Stars.","Returning to the LP abandoned after the death of violinist Noel Sayre, the Black Swans craft a quietly devastating album that showcases his mournful playing.

FRKWYS Vol. 6,Ikue MoriJulianna Barwick,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa99d034d5c69bf4750/1:1/w_160/4b90478f.jpeg,2011-06-16 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15538-frkwys-vol-6/,Rvng Intl.,"Up to now, Julianna Barwick has not often engaged in collaboration. Her process, which involves layering her voice with a Loop Station, is defined by solitude; a feeling that comes across in her music with full force. So it was a nice surprise to hear that she would contribute to the Rvng label's FRKWYS series of 12"" records, which pairs contemporary and classic electronic artists. Barwick drew Ikue Mori of the seminal no-wave band DNA, who has ably kept up with new technology, evolving from trap sets to drum machines to computer software. The four extended, improvised movements that compose FRKWYS Vol. 6 are familiar turf for Mori, but a whole new world for Barwick. The music was recorded in New York's White Columns gallery last fall-- half with the musicians each isolated in a cubicle; Mori with her laptop and Barwick with her looping console. (A video documenting the performance can be found here.) Right away, with ""Dream Sequence"", fans of Florine and The Magic Place will find themselves in new territory. Barwick's voice is lightly scattered amid an array of computerized slide whistles and metallic resonance-- not an enveloping presence, but a thing among things. Several minutes elapse before she unleashes one of her trademarked melodious shrieks. Playing against Barwick's usual placidity, it's almost chaotic, but still has a clear build, climax, and resolution. Mori's music comes from machines but evokes the natural world, pulling in sounds like dripping water, crackling electricity, and warped chimes. This is consistent across all four tracks, though each has a singular arc and feel once you get past the uniformly distressed surfaces. On ""Stalactite Castle"", Barwick's voice competes with mechanical vortices that call to mind Ellen Allien and Antye Greie. Then she takes a more leading and openly songful role on ""Rain and Shine at the Lotus Pond"" and ""Rejoinder"", with an almost choral home stretch bringing the record to an arresting close. Barwick fans may feel an initial wave of disappointment that this doesn't bash you over the head with holiness the way her records do. And those who appreciate her music through the filter of Enya, rather than Brian Eno, may find Mori's haywire electronics simply indigestible. It's not the sort of thing you just throw on in the background, as The Magic Place could be. But taken on its own terms, it's a sneakily bewitching record that bodes well for Barwick's future. Until now, we knew that she was very good at one thing-- FRKWYS Vol. 6 is an encouraging sign that she's willing and able to branch out.","Fresh off her hypnotic LP The Magic Place, Barwick collaborates on a live set with experimental music vet Ikue Mori.

Deserter's Songs [Deluxe Edition],Mercury Rev,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef49d034d5c69bf4626/1:1/w_160/6ecdcabf.jpg,2011-06-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/,V2FontanaCooperative,"Early promo copies of Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs were mailed out to press in a cardboard-replica postal packet, complete with a stamp and a postmark advertising its release date. This was no random act: In 1998, a new Mercury Rev album could have felt like a postcard from a long-lost, old friend. Unlikely beneficiaries of the post-Nirvana major-label cattle call, Mercury Rev initially overcame the inter-band acrimony that fueled their first two brilliantly frazzled albums (1991's Yerself Is Steam and 1993's Boces), only to slip further into oblivion with the more refined but commercially ignored 1995 release, See You on the Other Side. A subsequent improvised recording released under the name Harmony Rockets (1995's Paralyzed Mind of the Archangel Void) suggested the band was forsaking populist ambition to delve deeper into the psych-noise underground. Aside from a songwriting credit for Rev ringleader Jonathan Donahue on the Chemical Brothers' Dig Your Own Hole, by 1997, Mercury Rev had effectively vanished. The arrival of Deserter's Songs on the nascent V2 label was a brow-raiser in and of itself; but that sense of pleasant surprise turned to dumbstruck disbelief once the CD was dropped in the player. Mercury Rev had flirted with symphonic flourishes and sentimental balladry before, but usually delivered them in a haze of distortion (Boces' ""Something For Joey"") or cheeky, irreverent arrangements (See You on the Other Side's ""Everlasting Arm""). Deserter's Songs' opening track, ""Holes"", however, was something else entirely: Never before had Donahue left his helium-high croon so vulnerable and exposed, and never before had the band's densely textured arrangements been deployed to such moving emotional effect, with the song's eye-welling surge of orchestration and weepy bowed-saw lines perfectly complementing Donahue's crestfallen lyrics. And while there were always themes of New York state iconography running through the band's disjointed discography-- the Coney Island Cyclone, the Rockettes, Bronx cheers-- Deserter's Songs projected an especially vivid sense of place, casting a set of intimate, romantic narratives against the staggering natural beauty of the band's upstate New York surroundings. Credit producer/bassist Dave Fridmann for foregrounding certain agrarian classic-rock influences-- namely, Jack Nitzsche-era Neil Young, the Band, and Brian Wilson-- that were heretofore buried behind the band's wall of squall; Mercury Rev even went so far as to solicit guest contributions from Levon Helm and Garth Hudson for some authentic Big Pink flavor. In a sense, Deserter's Songs practically functions as a tourist brochure for the Empire State, with the stirring centerpiece track ""Opus 40"" referencing both the titular stone-sculpture garden in Saugerties and the looming Catskill mountains, while ""Hudson Line"" pays tribute to the train route that provides an upstate escape from New York City. I had always written off the latter track as Deserter's Songs' most frivolous-- owing to Hudson's supper-club-smooth sax line and the meek vocal courtesy of guitarist Grasshopper-- but in it, we hear the album's guiding philosophy: ""Gonna leave the city, gonna catch the Hudson Line/ You know I love the city, but I haven't got the time."" Deserter's Songs was likewise a necessary act of retreat for a band that had long been defined by chaos and turmoil, and its peaceful, back-to-nature ethos felt all the more radical at a time when the harsh, mechanized sounds of big-beat electronica and nu-metal dominated the airwaves. The album's considerable critical success practically spawned a sub-genre of its own, with subsequent releases by the Flaming Lips (The Soft Bulletin, also recorded by Fridmann at his Tarbox Studios), the Delgados (The Great Eastern; Fridmann again), and Grandaddy (The Sophtware Slump) all hewing to a similar balance of lyrical intimacy and orchestral expanse. And while Mercury Rev's spotty track record since Deserter's Songs has currently driven the band into the same sort of limbo in which they found themselves prior to recording the album, you can still hear a distinctly Deserter's mix of the rustic and the epic in contemporaries like Fleet Foxes, My Morning Jacket, and Arcade Fire. Hopefully, this 2xCD reissue will serve to raise the band's stock once again, and that could very well be the true impetus behind this package; tellingly, Mercury Rev have chosen to mark their 20th anniversary not by re-releasing their 1991 debut, but rather the record that has effectively allowed them to survive for two decades. Collectors of Deserter's Songs' singles will know that, for B-sides, the band often resorted to its deep arsenal of covers, but none of these is represented on this issue's bonus disc (presumably because many of them were already compiled on the 2006 best-of collection, Stillness Breathes). But we do get a batch of rough yet illuminating demos that help connect the dots between Mercury Rev's experimental roots and Deserter's Songs' immaculate conception. The Tascam takes on ""Endlessly"" and ""Tonite It Shows"" sound closer to early-70s Lennon than their more Disneyfied final versions, and the sax-less ""Hudson Line"" feels much less anomalous in this setting. Most remarkable of all is an embryonic version of ""Goddess on a Hiway"", both for its crude, tape-decayed presentation and its original recording date: 1989. That Donahue was sitting on Deserter's Songs' lead single for almost 10 years could be seen as proof of the early Mercury Rev's preference for the anarchic over the affecting. Or maybe he just needed to wait for his band's darkest, most uncertain hour to sing that chorus-- ""I know... it ain't gonna last""-- with the conviction and desperation it demands.","Mercury Rev's influential orchestral rock landmark from 1998 has been reissued in 2xCD form, with an extra disc of demos and rarities.

Ways of Meaning,Kyle Bobby Dunn,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af92ea9e61561daa6493/1:1/w_160/437e1219.jpg,2011-06-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15523-ways-of-meaning/,Desire Path,"For a drone artist, the differences between one release and the next are often subtle. It comes with the territory. You make subtle music to begin with, and like any artist you feel the burden of not wanting to repeat yourself. Kyle Bobby Dunn clearly feels this burden. He's been making drone records since 2002, and since 2005 he's released a fairly steady stream of albums, EPs, limited cassettes, and other small-run recordings. So he's covered a lot of ground within his style already. Ways of Meaning sticks to what we already know Dunn does well: patient drone. But it does it differently from anything he's released before. It's his least varied and most musically active album, though that's not quite as paradoxical as it may sound. Here, Dunn is focused on a certain type of rounded, pillow-soft tone that has the feel of cold, clear air, or in its more active moments, the play of light underwater. But there's a lot you can do with those types of sounds, and Dunn does a lot over 40 minutes. With one exception, he keeps the pieces short and homed-in on a single idea, leaving behind both the rougher, organic tones and the longer structures of much of his past work. The album opens with a pair of pieces that move in opposite directions to explore dissonance and consonance. No music made with the sounds Dunn uses could ever be described as harsh, but ""Dropping Sandwiches (in Chester Lake)"" manages to make them slightly unsettling by combining them in strange harmonies. The purity of the tones and half-empty texture of the music have a strange effect on the dissonant harmony, though-- rather than coalescing into a sour chord, the notes seem to hang next to each other in gentle disagreement. Tones overlap on ""Canyon Meadows"" with a rhythm roughly equivalent to wind chimes-- there appears to be no set meter for the comings and goings of individual tones, but the clamor as they emerge and disappear still constitutes a harmonious whole. The one long track, ""Movement for the Completely Fucked"", essentially stretches the rest of the album's approach across 15 slowly drifting minutes. ""Drifting"" is really the right word for it, too. When I think of more ballasted drone music, like that of Stars of the Lid, I think of ""shifting,"" because those sounds seem like they'd take some effort to move. But these feel like they might blow away and drift forever if you let go. Ways of Meaning is drone music with a light touch and the gravity turned off.","Drone artist subtly drifts from the rougher, organic sounds of his past work to rounded, pillow-soft tones with the feel of cold, clear air.

The Errant Charm,Vetiver,by: Eric Grandy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa513d197565213a303/1:1/w_160/79e52d79.jpg,2011-06-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15537-the-errant-charm/,Sub Pop,"Saying a record makes great background music is usually taken as damningly faint praise at best. Sure, the music sets a mood-- so what? But for something to fade gracefully into the scenery, it has to be finely crafted enough that nothing snags or jars. Unobtrusiveness isn't always a fault, nor is attention-grabbing necessarily a virtue. I realized this one afternoon last summer at a BBQ, where Vetiver's 2009 album Tight Knit was playing at low volume from another room, providing the perfect sonic wallpaper for the day: gentle folk songs drifting into not-quite-yacht rock-- wooden ship rock, maybe. The album didn't grab your attention so much as gently hold your interest, complementing rather than interfering. Paradoxically, half-listening to the album revealed something that giving it full focus did not. It was like some ""Doctor Who"" creature that you could see in peripheral vision but which disappears when you look directly at it. Vetiver's new album, their fifth (and second for Sub Pop), pulls off much the same trick. This is part sound design:The drums are muted, often no more than a muffled kick pulse; the guitars are finger-picked acoustic or else electric with the edges slicked entirely off; and singer/songwriter Andy Cabic holds his vowels long and lofty, sighing his lyrics as much as singing them. It's also part songwriting: Cabic's melodies are impeccably understated, and his leisurely lyrics set an undeniably easy-going mood. This sort of thing has been Vetiver's lane since their anomalously freak-folky debut, and there's not much here in the way of either deviations or dramatic leaps forward; if Cabic and longtime producer Thom Monahan have tinkered with the band's sound, their improvements are subtle enough as to be imperceptible. Of course, given time, the best background music insinuates its way into your foreground, and after about a week with The Errant Charm, a few of its highlights will work their way into a listener's head: the way Cabic's vocal traces the guitar scale on the chorus of ""Worse for Wear""; the cruising JJ Cale vibe of ""Ride, Ride, Ride""; the deck chair-ready guitar glide of ""Fog Emotion""; the soft organ trill and backbeat to ""Can't You Tell"". Best of all is ""Wonder Why"", an upbeat and unreservedly catchy number, driven by bright guitar picking backed by piano, bobbing bass, chords that rev up to the chorus, and the album's most straight-ahead, snare-hitting drumming. Over the top of it, Cabic harmonizes and hums, world-weary and a little worried, but still sounding largely optimistic. Presumably if Cabic-- formerly of dub percussionists Tussle and frequent touring sideman of Devendra Banhart-- just wanted to make an ambient drone album, it would certainly be within his powers, and it would probably be fine. But his songs as Vetiver, for all their breezy lightness, seem to aspire to something more like the spotlight, or at least the talking-stick spot at the campfire. The Errant Charm doesn't entirely succeed in that regard, but it remains a pleasant listen, perhaps just a bit too subliminally so for its own good.","Andy Cabic's folk-rock project still has a way with good vibes and appealing arrangements on its fifth album.

Locussolus,DJ Harvey,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7aea9e61561daa6468/1:1/w_160/a4c4c104.jpg,2011-06-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15501-locussolus/,International Feel,"Harvey Bassett has had a long and idiosyncratic career in dance music, one that speaks as much to the necessity of scene and tastemakers in that sphere as actual musicians. At least partially responsible for the spread of influential house and disco sounds to England, the Cambridge-born Bassett spent the 1990s booking DJs like Larry Levan in London and holding supposedly awesome residencies at a handful of influential clubs. These days, Bassett resides in Los Angeles where he hosts his epic, invite-only Sarcastic Disco parties. Suffice to say that if it was dance music and it was created in the 1980s or 1990s, Bassett was on that shit before you. Not that Bassett wasn't making music as well; he was just doing so sporadically and seemingly in deference to his career as a party-starter of unimpeachable taste. DJ Harvey Presents Locussolus represents the first time in Bassett's 20-year career that a full-length CD of his work will be available (he released a Late Night Sessions mix for London's Ministry of Sound in 1996). (It's a fitting title, ""Locus Solus"" being the private estate of a mad scientist in Raymond Roussel's novel of the same name.) It's not a proper album-- not even particularly close-- rather a collection of the three Locussolus 12""s he has released since 2010. One new track, ""Bloodbath"", and remixes by the likes of Andrew Weatherall and Lindstrom & Prins Thomas round out the collection. Sequenced cleverly, Locussolus actually functions well as a long player. If you close your eyes and forget the track titles, the fact that ""Gunship"" is just one track removed from a remix of itself makes it sound more like a variation on a theme rather than CD padding. Bassett is all over the dance music map, but he mostly sticks to the sounds of mid-80s electro and house, with heavy doses of Ze Records hippie-dust. It is a beguiling and slippery mix. During Weatherall's dubby ""Gunship"" remix, as a lunatic rants about hams in the middle of the street (20 listens later and I'm still flipping a coin to decide if this is a metaphor), I am certain I am listening to electronic music and that DJ Harvey made this music, but little else. Locussolus isn't immersive; rather, it commands your attention without making a fuss about it. ""I Want It"" checks of most of the ""classic house"" boxes-- thick, salty basslines, insistent kick drums, reverberating synth pads-- but Bassett's banal, circular back-and-forth with a female voice gives the track life as it morphs into a (G-)funky strut. ""Tan Sedan"" steams forward as a sci-fi floor-filler, its UFO-synths jamming languorously over its lock-step bassline. Bassett isn't a sonic radical, just a hip, studied craftsman unafraid to let his freak flag fly. For those of us not privy to Harvey's parties-- old or new-- Locussolus is a treat: a document of one of dance music's behind-the-scenes/decks all-stars.

Castlemania,Thee Oh Sees,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa7b1335d7bf1699f9c/1:1/w_160/be54e9b5.jpg,2011-06-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/,In the Red,"Over the past decade, San Francisco's Thee Oh Sees have morphed from a showcase for skronk-savant John Dwyer's sensitive side into the hardest working band in garage-rock. Their output is prolific and their live show combustible. But on Castlemania, Dwyer opts to go it alone. With the exception of live-band regular Brigid Dawson-- who, along with the Sandwitches' Heidi Alexander, contributes some backing vocals-- the shaggy-banged songwriter handles almost all of the instruments. Drummer Mike Shoun and Guitarist Petey Dammit aren't out of the picture permanently. They're just off-duty until the fall, when Thee Oh Sees are scheduled to release yet another full-length record. Castlemania is a fairly introspective affair, at least by Oh Sees standards. It's Dywer's most melodious batch of songs since 2006's mostly acoustic Cool Death of the Island Raiders. Without the heavy full-band artillery he leans toward skewed bubble-gum pop, fleshing out the guitars and drums with flutes, bells and thrift store synths. It was recorded, at least in part, at Dywer's former group house. ""This here is the last record worked on at 608c Haight Street in San Francisco (very near and dear to my heart and heavy in my memories) before control was assumed by rich assholes,"" he writes in the liner notes. Not that this is Thee Oh Sees' answer to Nebraska. Even at his most reflective, Dwyer's songwriting retains a sinister, ""Sesame Street""-on-LSD sensibility-- simple melodies and creepy lyrics, frequently delivered in a whacked-out monster-voice. ""It don't feel too good to be dead in the 21st century/ I am dirt but I can be/ A home for wayward hungry seeds,"" Dwyer growls on ""I Need Seed"", deploying a Looney Tunes-worthy narrative in a song about death. It's summery retro nuggets pinned into the red, shot through with a healthy dose of drugs and dread, while ""Pleasure Blimps"" finds him singing of machines stripping away flesh over shimmering glockenspiel lines and 12-string guitars. All in all, Castlemania is a fairly loose and scattered record. There are plenty of oddball tangents, including a stripped-down and spooky cover of West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's ""I Won't Hurt You"" and the forlorn mellotron and sax instrumental, ""The Horse Was Lost"". Songs frequently melt down into racket rather than stop on a dime. But it's good to hear Dwyer step away from his backing band's big guns, if only for a moment.","The latest installment from the prolific SF-based psych rockers finds frontman John Dwyer handling more of the instruments and taking the pace down a notch.

McCartney / McCartney II,Paul McCartney,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa39d034d5c69bf4746/1:1/w_160/6f88d6f5.jpeg,2011-06-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15536-mccartney-mccartney-ii/,Concord,"Released 10 years apart, McCartney and McCartney II are the first two post-Beatles albums to be credited solely to Paul McCartney, without Wings or Linda McCartney. In that respect, it makes some sense to reissue the two simultaneously, but their original contexts could hardly be more different. In 1970, when advance copies of McCartney were sent to journalists, they included a press sheet announcing Paul's departure from the Beatles, which had the further effect of breaking up the band. McCartney was released a month before Let It Be, and it contained a fair amount of music that had been kicking around for some time. McCartney II, on the other hand, was released in 1980, about a year before the breakup of Wings, a band that was never much more than a vehicle for McCartney's solo songwriting efforts. Wings had no John Lennon to play foil to McCartney. Lennon and McCartney, as everyone knows, were the songwriting partners who made the Beatles such a titanic force in the 1960s. By the time the band broke up, however, the partnership had been mostly dissolved for years. The two were almost always writing separately, and on those late Beatles albums, you can hear their personalities pulling apart. The separation is complete on the solo albums the two former Beatles released in 1970. Lennon's Plastic Ono Band is rough, nasty, self-absorbed, not a little narcissistic, and devoted to laying bare the rawest of emotions and memories. It has overshadowed McCartney since its release. McCartney is a different type of album. First, let's talk about that title. This is a name that had been paired with Lennon, separated by a slash, for years-- we weren't used to seeing it all by itself. When the media ran stories on McCartney, he was often just ""Paul."" He could have called his album Paul McCartney, but he pointedly did not. I think he wanted people to see his name out there as a songwriting credit, without the old prefix. And the album he made has some parallels to Lennon's, too. They share a rawness, a seeming desire to move away from the opulence of 1969's Abbey Road, the last album the Beatles recorded together. But where the rawness of Plastic Ono Band plays into anger, aggression, and disillusionment, the rawness of McCartney is only in the sound. The record has a homespun charm, and a feel that suggests McCartney wasn't putting too much pressure on himself to carry on the Beatles flame or make a statement. Paul played everything on the record himself, apart from some backing vocals by Linda, recording much of it at home on a four-track. No singles were released, there are several instrumentals, and it's all a bit ramshackle, the type of album that in the hands of most musicians would lend itself to introspection. And yet McCartney doesn't really tell us much about McCartney. As a songwriter, he wasn't (and still isn't, really) the confessional type. To a degree, McCartney is an actor whose medium is his songs. His love for Linda, expressed so ebulliently on ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", was certainly genuine, but he wrote this eventual FM-radio staple as a classic, universal love song. When presented with the opportunity to let his guard down and show us his unvarnished self, Paul McCartney never did-- even in this intimate setting, his songs remain extroverted and devoted to achieving some measure of pop accessibility. The highlights of McCartney's later solo albums were often uptempo rock songs, or big, show-stopping tunes, but here, apart from ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", the peaks include two versions of the same quiet song, ""Junk"". The sparse vocal version features McCartney accompanying himself with acoustic guitar and a bit of bass and percussion, ticking through a nostalgic inventory of disused objects. McCartney later reprises ""Junk"" in a ""singalong"" instrumental version, with mellotron and piano joining in for a pretty waltz. I'd be surprised if Elliott Smith didn't learn something from it. Much of the rest of the album was written and recorded off the cuff, and it shows-- McCartney plays with Latin rhythms (""The Lovely Linda""), a bit of blues (""That Would Be Something""), and some bounding, half-time country pop (""Man We Was Lonely""). ""Teddy Boy"" is sentimental storytelling, and closer ""Kreen-Akrore"" is McCartney experimenting in his weird, humorous way with oddball drum patterns and sound effects. That sort of experimentation and lack of polish was something McCartney didn't often allow himself on later solo efforts. As the 70s moved on, he got back to consciously crafting big hits, and he scored quite a few. Ram, Venus and Mars, and Band on the Run rank among the best Beatles solo albums, and all exhibit the kind of studio perfectionism that was absent on McCartney. On McCartney II, the polish is there, but that's partly down to improvements in home recording technology-- McCartney did much of the recording on his own at his farm in Scotland, and there's a similar low-pressure, anything-goes vibe to the final product. That said, this album is likely to be jarring for an unsuspecting McCartney or Beatles fan. It's largely experimental, devoting most of its songs to eccentric synth-pop that's just as weird as anything from the early days of new wave, and not all of it is compelling. McCartney II's opener and first single, ""Coming Up"", wastes no time getting right into this startling territory, with a guitar part that could have been lifted from a Talking Heads song, buzzy keyboard hooks, and vocals that find McCartney singing through a filter and backing himself up with quirky falsetto. McCartney's discography is actually filled with strange little one-offs and experiments, including late-period work with Super Furry Animals and Fireman, but this one is unusual for the way he presented it as a central part of his output rather than a side project. Elsewhere on the album, McCartney remains similarly difficult to pigeonhole. If I told you the instrumental ""Front Parlour"", with its tinny drum machine and sunny keyboard melody, was a 2009 blog hit by a lo-fi synth act, you'd likely believe me. And then there's ""Temporary Secretary"", a frankly irritating but still interesting song that combines frenzied synth programming with a self-consciously bizarre vocal-- McCartney sings as nasally as possible on the refrain, and tweaks it to sound robotic. Other songs turn away from this type of maximalist approach. ""Summer's Day Song"" is pretty and sparse, featuring just McCartney and a few keyboards. TLC-presaging single ""Waterfalls"" is even more bare, only McCartney and an electric piano, with a tiny dollop of synth and acoustic guitar. Two other songs stand out on McCartney II, and they're as distinct from each other as this record is from McCartney. Album closer ""One of These Days"" is simply great, benefiting from a rudimentary approach that strips away the synths and drum machines that dominate McCartney II. Bonus track ""Secret Friend"", included on the second disc of this reissue, is also pretty jaw-dropping-- a 10-minute, beat-driven synth opus that shares plenty in common aesthetically with dance music a decade its junior. Though relegated to the B-side of the ""Temporary Secretary"" single, ""Secret Friend"" is among the most forward-looking things McCartney has recorded in his post-Beatles career. Those McCartney II extras stand in sharp contrast with the bonus material for McCartney, which is largely inconsequential-- the live tracks are 1979 performances with Wings, hardly illuminating where McCartney was as an artist at the time he made the album. Still, McCartney is a very good record and deserves another look. And this is just about the perfect time to take another look at McCartney II, despite its flaws. Parts of the album sound oddly current; it's difficult to gauge whether McCartney II had any real influence on the synth-pop of the 80s, but its diffuse and slightly wobbly atmosphere certainly aligns with a great deal of recent music made on synths and drum machines. Though an odd couple in many ways, these two albums represent often-overlooked corners of McCartney's music, and they're worth rediscovering.","Separated by a decade, the first two post-Beatles albums credited solely to Paul McCartney are a strange pair, but they shouldn't be overlooked.

Walls,An Horse,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8fea9e61561daa648c/1:1/w_160/04e7b20a.jpg,2011-06-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15520-walls/,Mom + Pop,"An Horse frontwoman Kate Cooper spends the band's second album, Walls, struggling to connect to other people and watching other lives as they fall apart. On ""Swallow the Sea"" she hits on a possible explanation: ""Maybe it's our convict blood,"" posits the refrain, a clever and poignant nod to Cooper's and bandmate Damon Cox's Australian heritage. Perhaps that's not the most scientific rationale for why the duo's songs are full of so much heartache and dissolution, but it's the best one An Horse offer, unless you count the time in ""Not Mine"" where Cooper admits, ""That's enough 'Twin Peaks' for one night."" These moments of self-awareness and cheek stick out because Cooper spends much of Walls navel-gazing and mired in helplessness. As a result, the success of the album's songs is pretty much directly proportional to how much of a riffy ruckus they kick up to bolster Cooper's bum trips. An Horse may seem superficially limited with only two members and a stripped-down reliance on guitar and drums, but the duo still manages to range impressively between indie-rock anthemics and straight-up punk-pop blasts. The punky stuff is the most fun of course-- ""Airport Death"", ""Trains and Tracks"", and ""Leave Me"" invite favorable Sleater-Kinney comparisons in the marriage of Cooper's aggrieved, plaintive vocals and the music's ripping uptempo blur. Even with more space to breathe, though, An Horse prove capable of powerful songcraft, taking a more ruminative but still rousing emo-indie tack on ""Dressed Sharply"" and ""Know This, We've Noticed"", songs that show you why the band made a worthy opening act to Death Cab for Cutie in 2008. The back half of Walls finds An Horse's music propping up Cooper with decreased verve, and the results are accordingly hit or miss. Her heartsick complaints can grab you by the throat when the band's pleading too, but midtempo meanders and subdued strummers tend to make the whole effect downright grating, with the title track and closing ""Tiny Skeletons"" being the worst offenders (though the pretty acoustic detour ""Windows in the City"" is a notable exception). Walls is still a likeable and engaging album on the whole, but it's hard not to be a tad worried that An Horse's debut album began with a song where Cooper fiercely and endearingly sang, ""And like that good Hole album/ I can live through this,"" while its follow-up ends with a song where she mewls, ""Ian Curtis said it would tear us apart.""","At its best, this Australian duo brings to mind Sleater-Kinney's mix of plaintive vocals and ripping uptempo blur.

Are You Gonna Eat That?,Hail Mary Mallon,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9aea9e61561daa64a3/1:1/w_160/7340e39d.jpg,2011-06-14 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15530-are-you-gonna-eat-that/,Rhymesayers,"In a certain dark corner of the music universe, Aesop Rock was a very, very big deal. As arguably the biggest name on the Definitive Jux roster, Aesop made for an unlikely star, but I can vividly remember the hordes of hoodied, stubble-headed, tough-looking suburban and outer-borough kids who'd cram into clubs and roar along with his bent, cluttered, wriggling lyrical abstractions. Aesop was and is a born cult figure, his sleepy stoner charisma intersecting just right with his berserk linguistic flights. And in the Def Jux world of clattering psych-rap production and elaborate sci-fi packaging, he did more than fit in; he stood above. The Aesop era seems like it's been over for a few years, and there are a few reasons for that. Rap moves fast, and we're seeing a whole new wave of Internet-borne young rap iconoclasts; old cults give way to new ones. Definitive Jux, a label built at least partly on gorgeous packaging and object fetishization, wasn't built for today's world; it effectively closed up shop last year. But mostly, Aesop just hasn't been around. He released his last album, None Shall Pass, in 2007, and where he once guested on virtually every album that his scene produced, his verses have become less and less frequent. So it's truly refreshing to see Aesop return in pleasantly low-stakes form, as one of three guys in the new group Hail Mary Mallon. On Are You Gonna Eat That?, Aesop and co-conspirators Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz don't exactly let up on the brain-addling lyrical and musical density. But the album isn't some grand statement. They sound exactly like what they are: three guys off in a room somewhere, making rap music and having fun doing it. Rob Sonic is an old Def Jux labelmate of Aesop's, and to say they've got chemistry might be understating things a bit. For stretches of the album, they practically sound like the same person. Rob's been getting Aesop comparisons for years, and his style is truly similar; like Aesop, he raps in tumbling nasal syllable-clumps, blasting us with one obscure image and then moving onto another before our brains have caught up. His delivery is a bit less guttural and more straightforwardly laid back, but he's got the same commitment to fucking with our collective head. (The first line of Rob's first verse on the album: ""Leopard print Speedo on the FDR, saying 'Follow that car!'."") Rob and Aesop jointly produced the album, and their combined style is a psychedelic knock familiar to anyone who ever paid attention to Def Jux: fuzzed-out guitars fighting for space with sputtering cluster-bombs of drums. But there's also a variation to it; the album's over in 41 minutes, and the tracks jump restlessly from one idea to the next. Choruses are rare; Big Wiz's precise, musical scratches usually play that role. And there's not a single rapping guest on the album; this is strictly a family affair. At times, they sound like they're having too much fun; the absurdist 808 thud of ""Grubstake"" and the intentionally annoying chipmunk voices of ""Breakdance Beach"" were probably more enjoyable to record than they are to hear. But there's real joy in hearing Aesop and Rob compete to see who can come up with the most inscrutably memorable turn of phrase. (Aesop wins on ""Garfield"": ""Document the war of the department-store Santas from the POV of cameras hid in the dog's antlers."") About a decade after the Def Jux boom, it's almost comfort food to hear these guys slip-sliding over bent beats like these, but it's still a heady, potent experience. And it reaches a peak on final track ""Plagues and Bacon"", on which Aesop tries out a double-time flow over a twisting speedball of a psych-dance beat. These guys may not be back in their ambition-heavy fighting form on Are You Gonna Eat That?, but they're back to rapping just for the fuck of it, and that can be a beautiful thing to hear. And hearing the album, it's immediately apparent that Aesop is still a major talent, someone who can do whatever the hell he wants and get away with it. Aesop's next album might be a collaborative thing with Moldy Peaches member Kimya Dawson, and that's a confounding prospect but also an intriguing one. Are You Gonna Eat That? is a retrenchment move, but that's OK. But once Aesop returns to full-on bent-experimentalist mode, that's when he could really become a force again.","This pleasantly low-stakes side project from cult MC Aesop Rock sounds like three guys making rap music and having fun doing it.

With U EP,Holy Other,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9b13d197565213a2f1/1:1/w_160/fa1936f2.jpg,2011-06-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15531-with-u-ep/,Tri Angle,"Depending on which article or news story you read, Holy Other could hail from Manchester, Gothenburg, Stockport, or Berlin. The fact-shy producer is apparently now settled in Manchester, but there's a sense of disconnection that remains integral to his ghostly productions. There's a strong sense of loneliness in the swarm of sampled vocals that make up the spine of the tracks on With U, reflecting both in the way Holy Other treats his sources and the mixture of genres he pulls from. Take the title track, which shuffles out from a poppy, electronic piano sample in a motif that is at once disarmingly gentle and slightly creepy. As skittering rhythms pan from left to right, a pitched-down vocal bathes the track in darkness, and ""with you"" is the only discernable lyric as the sample repeats. The track has a yearning sound, each element working to intensify that feeling, from the off-kilter piano line to the vaporous layers of reverb. That echoing atmosphere is abundant on the EP and has a knack for making Holy Other's production seem tantalizingly half-solid and transient. ""Touch"" uses the same kind of tricks with a lithe vocal line at the heart of the track. This time, the voice sounds closer to the kind of manipulations Burial mined so successfully on Untrue. That kind of skewed affectation has been a common device in electronic music since then, but something about Holy Other's cloud of overlapping vocal samples gives it a different, more romantic feel. While that busier vocal work makes up the bulk of the track, an ominous bass line thunders deep in the mix, gliding slowly from note to note. The drop is one of the more noticeable signifiers from witch house and aligns Holy Other more strongly with other Tri Angle Records artists Balam Acab and oOoOO. The glacial drag of those artists is reflected again on closing track ""Feel Something"", with its starkly contrasting bass and trebly keys. It shares the listlessness and detached atmosphere common in this scene, but once again Holy Other's use of vocals pulls the track somewhere unexpected. This time, the sample hews closer to its native pitch and feels all the more striking for it. Transplanted out of its original context, the latent sensuality and drama in the vocals are squeezed down to their stark essence. On first listen, the haze of With U can seem pro forma, but diving deeper beneath the surface reveals a deceptively fragmented record made up of enticing titbits and interesting juxtapositions. It's a strangely affecting synthesis of sounds and marks Holy Other's short debut out as a darkly oppressive but ultimately rewarding piece of work.","Holy Other's debut EP on the Tri Angle label uses tools common in the post-Burial witch house scene but manages some intriguing new twists.

An Empty Bliss Beyond This World,The Caretaker,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8dc0084474cd0c1ac6/1:1/w_160/acb40c9a.jpg,2011-06-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/,History Always Favours the Winners,"An Empty Bliss Beyond This World sounds like a collection of edits of prewar parlor-room music because that's what it is. ""This Caretaker album is built from layers of sampled 78s and albums,"" James Kirby told me in an email recently. ""Things have been rearranged in places and other things brought in and out of focus. Surface noise""-- which is abundant-- ""is from the original vinyls."" Kirby is an artist whose concepts are sometimes more fun to engage with than his music. As V/Vm-- a project he started in the early 1990s-- he made grotesque edits of soft-pop songs and released an entire 7"" of the sounds of pigs feeding. His albums as the Caretaker have been comparatively more subdued, tending toward ambient music made from preexisting recordings. Bliss was inspired by a 2010 study suggesting that Alzheimer's patients have an easier time remembering information when it's placed in the context of music. What makes it unique isn't that Kirby resuscitates old but vaguely familiar source material; it's how he edits it. Several of the tracks here take pretty, anodyne phrases and loop them mindlessly; several stop in what feels like mid-thought; several reach back and then jump forward. They never feel filled-in from start to finish, and they tend to linger on moments that feel especially comforting or conclusive: the last flourishes of a song, maybe, the pat on the shoulder, the part when we're assured everything is drawing to a close. Kirby isn't just making nostalgic music, he's making music that mimics the fragmented and inconclusive ways our memories work. Unlike Kirby's last few albums, whether as the Caretaker or Leyland Kirby, Bliss isn't dissonant or heavy-handed. Nobody has to remind me that losing my memory is upsetting, or that I'm losing it as I type, or that the loss will probably accelerate as I get older, or that I'll probably spend my final hours sitting by a window repeating myself. What I like about Bliss is that, as the title suggests, there's something at least metaphorically beautiful-- even slightly funny-- about living inside a locked groove, dancing with nobody. The last five years or so have been filled with music that feels haunted by an unresolved moment or looks at the past from a crooked perspective. The Ghost Box label has been consistently good at making jigsaw puzzles from cultural memories; Ariel Pink's grotesque soft-rock finally has an audience-- even music by a producer like Burial relies on the intrusion of a voice that sounds more part of history than the present, something reaching forward from a time we thought was gone. Kirby isn't unaware of what he's doing here-- everything he's put out in the past few years plays around with these ideas directly, down to his choice of titles (2009's Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Was being the most impressively gymnastic). Even calling himself ""The Caretaker""-- a reference to the endlessly recurring ballroom parties of The Shining-- feels like an effort to suss out the inherently psychedelic properties of memory. Bliss reminds me of Ekkehard Ehlers' ""Plays John Cassavetes 2"" and Gavin Bryars' ""Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet"", two pieces that transcend high-concept nostalgia. ""Cassavetes"" is a layered loop of the opening string figure from the Beatles' ""Good Night"", and the Bryars piece-- which was explored in a column here last year-- is a loop of a homeless man singing a hymn as an orchestra gradually builds behind him. In both cases, the actual amount of musical material is relatively small, and the ""work"" done on the part of the composer is minimal-- even Bryars' 30-minute build consists mostly of consonant drones. Bryars' and Ehlers' conceptual leap was to wear their moments out as completely as possible. Repetitive music has a way of dissolving a listener's ability to pay attention to it: by the end, Ehlers' and Bryars' pieces sound different from the beginning, but there's no part I can point to in them and say, ""here, here's where things change for good."" They're constantly changing. They're also constantly returning. With Kirby, the effect is even more subtle and confusing. ""Libet's Delay"", sounds like it confuses its end for its beginning (or vice versa), and ""Mental Caverns Without Sunshine"" appears twice, with a two-minute song in-between: It's as though Kirby is trying to trick you into experiencing déjà vu. In all three cases, the source material is music designed not only to comfort, but to sound like it existed before you: hymns, love songs, lullabies. Bliss is eerie because it takes the seduction of those forms and turns it slightly askew; there's something unsettling about the musical equivalent of a permanent smile.","James Leyland Kirby, the British producer also known for his work as V/Vm, returns as Caretaker with a haunting and gorgeous series of edits from old 78s.

Bakesale [Deluxe Edition],Sebadoh,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af91b1335d7bf1699f74/1:1/w_160/eb8f169e.jpg,2011-06-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15522-bakesale-deluxe-edition/,Sub Pop,"This Bakesale reissue is actually part of Lou Barlow's second unexpected reunion of the last decade. The first, of course, was his thought-it-would-never-happen rapprochement with longtime estranged partner J. Mascis in Dinosaur Jr. And then Sebadoh, the one-man-project turned full-blown band, found its second and best-loved line-up coming together again late last decade. The early Sebadoh records were purposefully fuzzy, mumbly things, full of raw pop yearning that was sometimes pretty hard to make out through all the hiss and crackle. Though they were key documents in the rise of lo-fi as a distinct movement in 1990s American indie, it's probably not coincidental that the word ""weed"" appeared prominently in several of the band's early releases, which often literally sound like the product of a baked mind and a four-track, flip-flopping between silliness and vein-opening. As Sebadoh became more of a democracy, the clashing urges of the various songwriters (Barlow, bassist Jason Loewenstein, second guitarist Eric Gaffney, who left before Bakesale) turned the full-band's first few records into sometimes frustrating (the CD skip button was made for these sort of jumbles) and sometimes beguiling (they had a real way with an anthemic pop-punk hook when they wanted to) collisions of styles. Pure indie-pop instincts fought with an urge toward experimental cassette tape fucking around. Bouncy power-chord jams rubbed up against shameless acoustic mopery. By Bakesale in 1994, they'd already written a couple of undeniable anthems with ""Gimme Indie Rock"" and ""Brand New Love"", the latter an instant-classic covered by peers like Superchunk in what seemed like seconds after it's release. But Bakesale was the first Sebadoh album where the power-chords and anthems seemed to win out. It was, and remains, their most focused and purely pleasurable record. The early- and mid-90s were great years for albums that brought punk's two-minute punchiness together with the earnest relationship laments that briefly defined that slippery terrain known as indie rock. And Bakesale is one of the era's best. If it's got fewer romance-gone-wrong epics than Superchunk's Foolish and lacks the emphatic guitar-snarl of Archers of Loaf's Icky Mettle, it combines bits of both tendencies into 15 songs that rarely outstay their welcome. Unlike Sebadoh's scattershot early albums, it works as a brief, memorable whole. The band probably wasn't trying to make a statement-- that sort of ran counter to the whole aesthetic back then-- but by tightening up and aiming for clarity, they managed one anyway. ""Feels good just to bitch about it,"" from ""Magnet's Coil"", is one of those lines that defines a certain part of early indie's appeal, where kids-like-you kvetched about their foibles and fears in an unpretentious way. But the album's frantic pace, where even the slow songs feel like urgent expulsions of heartbreak, defines the other side of indie's appeal. At its best, all that emoting was delivered with a healthy shot of energy that felt necessary given the sluggish tempos of alt-rock radio at the time. Bakesale sounds a little brighter on this remaster, though this isn't an album where you're really looking for crisp and distinct-in-the-mix instrumental interplay. Its opening three-song blast, all tumbling drums and jittery-but-beefy noise-pop guitar, is an obvious attempt to grab the attention of a new generation of kids who'd sprang up to embrace feelings-and-feedback. But even the somber stuff, like the ""Not a Friend"" to ""Dreams"" run early on, features strong, clear hooks instead of burying things in murk. This isn't to say the album is clean, at least not in the way indie records routinely are these days. But it's also not ""lo-fi"" in the indistinct or noise-obliterated way we've come to know. Without sacrificing the music's rough edges, the band was up enough on its hook-game that ""Rebound"" briefly hung around modern rock radio, Barlow's first unexpected minor-league hit until Folk Implosion's ""Natural One"" became the really unexpected hit a few years later. So Bakesale itself remains a strong and lovable essay on 90s indie's charms. But what of the expected and extensive bonus material? Well, in bearing-down to make a no-filler album, it's pretty clear that Sebadoh's goof-off and boo-hoo sides went into the singles, EPs, and ancillary material from the same era. Tunes (using the word very loosely) like ""MOR Backlash"", ""Foreground"", and ""Drumstick Jumble"" sound like the ""wacky"" bedroom sound-collage filler they would have been if they'd been included on Bakesale, and acoustic demo takes of ""Not a Friend"" and ""Mystery Man"" prove how quickly charming sensitivity can give way to unfortunate sad-sack territory when you strip away the electric oomph of the album versions. (Though the acoustic ""Magnet's Coil"" and ""Rebound"" prove they could hit you without any amplification.) Despite a few strong songs like ""Punching Myself in the Face Repeatedly, Publicly"" and ""Sing Something/Plate of Hatred"" that can almost stand with the album's best, these Bakesale add-ons will mostly be of value to those who loved Sebadoh's first few years of all-over-the-place wildness, but it's not as if their second-disc inclusion can dull the parent album's punch.","Sebadoh's most focused album, originally released in 1994, is given a deluxe 2xCD reissue with added singles and outtakes.

Earth Sound System,Jackie-O Motherfucker,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af845e6ef95969321e01/1:1/w_160/7be67881.jpg,2011-06-13 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15509-earth-sound-system/,Fire,"I want to live Jackie-O Motherfucker. I want to quit my pretty good downtown job and follow the band around Europe. I want to trade poorly recorded tapes with other superfans and scoff mightily at the non-believers. This is the type of devotion JOMF should inspire. To date, the long-running Portland collective's scabrous interpretation of Americana has been appropriately grimy and confrontational: Bandleader Tom Greenwood is the odds-on favorite to shiv a Fleet Fox. Lately, though, the band's increasingly tame albums haven't lived up to its reputation. Earth Sound System is structurally similar to recent JOMF offerings-- Valley of Fire, Ballads of the Revolution-- in that it features a handful of tracks split between extended improvisations and disarmingly straightforward electric balladry. JOMF have remained noisy, but tragically, they've discovered organization. The first track on Earth Sound System, ""In the Willows"", features Greenwood mumbling over bent chords, like a grounded, broken-winged Spiritualized. The next track, ""Raga Joining"", is a scraping jam, a drum machine bursting out of a flute in a rug warehouse. The songs, especially, sound cursory. Perhaps this is due to familiarity, once-fresh ideas that now seem rote. But I don't think so. JOMF used to build tracks around ideas, around snippets of speech or old hymns: They had ties to history, a history that JOMF were either besmirching or honoring (or both) with their treatments. Valley of Fire, for instance, featured two long tracks, one tethered to a ramshackle funk sermon and the other a tribute-- however tenuous-- to a Public Enemy song. But Greenwood's voice, a distinctly 1990s strain of off-key alt-troubadour, offers no such tether to the past. The concepts that were brilliantly muddled in Greenwood's mind-- noisenik gristle, folksong, skronky improvisation-- are now compartmentalized. The impulse is understandable: Greenwood is hardly the first artist to appropriate traditional songcraft before wanting to try his hand at it. But the songs on Earth Sound System lack the purpose of their inspiration. They lack even the dark hippie rhetoric the band is most capable of. When the band attempts bracing garage rock on the closing ""Where We Go"", they suck their air out of the room with their hoary posturing. Earth Sound System offers a different vision of JOMF, but a lesser one. Greenwood and co.'s impulses have grown disappointingly easy to dissect. The result is music that, by any definition, remains experimental and difficult, but the invigorating internal tension between the ordained simplicity of American musics and the free-will noise jams has evaporated. It's possible to appreciate Earth Sound System merely for its mossy overgrowth, but I'm not quitting my day job.","Latest from the long-running Portland collective maintains the group's experimental streak but loses some of the tension that defined its best work.

Clutching Stems,The Ladybug Transistor,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6c9d034d5c69bf46f9/1:1/w_160/e2c920e1.jpg,2011-06-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15491-clutching-stems/,Merge,"A member of the Ladybug Transistor appears only once in  Our Noise: The Story of Merge Records, 2009's wonderfully engaging oral history of the North Carolina label. It's a candid photo of a party during Merge's 10th anniversary festivities, in 1999, and keyboard player Sasha Bell, who also plays and sings with Elephant Six-affiliated labelmates the Essex Green, stands among more than a dozen other revelers. She's facing away from the camera. Brooklyn native Gary Olson and the rotating lineup of musicians that make up the Ladybug Transistor have been courting such brushes with indie almost-fame since the mid-1990s. They came closest with 1999's The Albermarle Sound, a model of psych-spangled, baroque-inclined indie pop. Bell left the band after 2003's fine self-titled album, which was recorded in Arizona rather than the band's usual Flatbush. And the Ladybug Transistor faced tragedy shortly before the release of 2007's disappointingly transitional Can't Wait Another Day, when they lost San Fadyl's steady drumming due to his death from an asthma attack. Four years later, the Ladybug Transistor's seventh album (and sixth for Merge) brings together yet another iteration of the band's roster for a modest, pleasant indie-pop record. ""Low-stakes"" is a phrase that seems to come up a lot these days, but it's not quite right for Clutching Stems, a solid record that's stylistically as lush and rich as ever from this group-- this is the opposite of lo-fi, the antithesis of garage-rock. Still, as easy as it is to root for the Ladybug Transistor after all these years, and especially their more recent hardships, the songs themselves often blend together, and sometimes it can be hard to remember their particulars. Clutching Stems steps back from the country and western direction hinted at on Can't Wait Another Day, and there's nothing here as jarring as the now-prescient sax solo from that album's opening ""Always on the Telephone"". Instead, the Ladybug Transistor's latest stays mostly in a safe but always comfortable cocoon of what could be called ""classic indie pop"": crisp drums, intimately mic'd acoustic guitars, chiming electric guitar riffs, autumnal keyboards, regal trumpet, and the gentle interplay between Olson's practiced baritone and guest Frida Eklund's soft harmonies. It's all rendered with appealing warmth and clarity. You could trace lines back to the Smiths, the Field Mice, and the Left Banke, or forward to Belle and Sebastian, Jens Lekman, the Lucksmiths, the Clientele, and the Radio Dept. Trains, Brooklyn, beaches, and crumbling relationships populate many of the lyrics, which tend to be understated and erudite, rife with slant rhymes and unexpected line breaks. ""Oh Christina"" is fairly representative: After field-recorded noises of seagulls and a subway train's arrival at Brighton Beach, a delicately picked acoustic introduction gives way to subtle, sophisticated 60s pop, weighted with music references: ""Can't you see it/ Was not me who believed that love will tear us apart."" The title track takes the Metro-North rail line one-way toward regret (""stems"" somehow rhymes with both ""friends"" and ""flames""), ""Light on the Narrow Gauge"" neatly evokes the ""dying light"" it describes, and ""Breaking Up on the Beat"" is a stately, melancholy reflection set by the oceanside. ""You know me, but not too well,"" Olson adds on another lonesome, midtempo contemplation, ""Ignore the Bell"". If only that were a little less true. Clutching Stems is a patient, exquisitely produced indie-pop record that never quite makes eye contact.","The Ladybug Transistor's seventh album brings together yet another iteration of the band's roster for a modest, pleasant indie-pop record.

Lobelia,Black Eagle Child,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af96ea9e61561daa649c/1:1/w_160/99d32b1a.jpg,2011-06-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15527-lobelia/,Preservation,"Lobelia, the first proper album by Wisconsin multi-instrumentalist Michael Jantz, is, to say it simplest, a nice and easy instrumental listen. That might seem like a backhanded compliment, the way you'd describe music that's suited for a dinner party or a Sunday afternoon, but never something you'd seek out or throw on the stereo simply for personal pleasure. But Lobelia, named for a flower Jantz' parents used in homeopathic remedies, is the sort of album that, if you hear it once, you'll only want to hear again and again. It's immersive and personal music, continually unfolding and forever revealing. Jantz prefers atmosphere to extravagance, using these 52 minutes to create a dozen moods instead of a half-dozen quick hits or technical workouts. He's created an open audio diary of sorts, something to keep exploring and discovering-- the quintessentially nice and easy instrumental album you hope never ends. With a careful mix of banjo, guitar, field recordings, and electronics, Jantz carefully paints short, bittersweet scenes of domestic life. ""Summer Street"" might be an appropriate title for a lithe, summer-of-fun jangle, but for Jantz, it's the score for waves of heat rising from blacktop, for the languid days of high heat and low activity. ""Porch Screens"" filters an old country guitar tune through a scrim of psychedelic distortion, the tones washing out into a serene glow. During ""Falling Off Your Bike"", hazy guitar notes fall through tape fuzz and slide guitar moans, while ""The Quarry Slide"" is a jubilant builder, moving from a momentary cycle of apprehension to a dance shuffle in only five minutes. ""The Bee's Nest"" appropriately buzzes, but Jantz plucks a sprightly, comfortable melody above the hum. Even the most threatening sights feel like home, he suggests. These pieces are like old postcards, with predictable images warped by the very personal contexts of the messages scribbled on the back. Like Alessandro Stefana's Poste e Telegrafi, the Books' The Lemon of Pink, or even the best of Stars of the Lid, Lobelia takes ideas and sounds you know and recreates them in Jantz' image. In instrumental music, the focus is so often on the playing and performances, with the laurels going to the musicians with the best chops. That has its place, of course, and it's at least part of the reason why people gravitate to music with words so consistently. It's easier to relate and hold on to a well-articulated story, sentiment, or slogan than it is a particularly perfected technique. Jantz is no slouch instrumentally-- the webs of guitar on ""Paper Delivery"" are involved and perfectly placed, while the richness and delivery of every chord during ""The River's Course"" speak to a craftsman who knows his tools. But Jantz' songs are bigger than their parts, more sophisticated than his playing suggests. When his emphasis is on imagination and feeling (and it mostly is for Lobelia), Jantz makes his most compelling music. ""I Forgot"", for instance, is the album's longest piece by about three minutes, but it's built almost entirely of lazy electronic hum and plucked notes that bounce around the room like the world's slowest pinballs. It's gentle and gorgeous. When Jantz mixes sounds of his newborn's laughter after nearly six minutes, it's a brilliantly sweet moment embedded in a simple piece of music-- a nice little bit of joy in a form that sometimes elects to strip the personality from its people.","Working with guitar, banjo, electronics, and field recordings, this Wisconsin artist has crafted an immersing instrumental album flecked with surprises.

I Gotta Rokk EP,DJ Shadow,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9413d197565213a2e2/1:1/w_160/374f6342.jpg,2011-06-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15525-i-gotta-rokk-ep/,Island,"DJ Shadow has been skirting predictability for a good long while. The Outsider might have been a critical and fanbase fiasco, but at least it proved he was trying to engage with the greater hip-hop world and make something that didn't fit the precedent of Endtroducing.... (And we got a pretty damn good E-40 track out of it.) Shadow could be excused for testing his limits, for reacting to the sounds currently reverberating through the instrumental hip-hop arena he helped build. And it's tempting to speculate what his next move might be. He could be ricocheting off recent psychedelic L.A. bass music, or trying to see how his beat-building/breakdown technique could spar against UK funky rhythms, or maybe just stripping things back to the point of minimalism. The fact that he's calling his upcoming album The Less You Know, the Better says something about his M.O., at least. Then again, the I Gotta Rokk EP contains a few singles drawn from that album, and they suggest a new direction more along the lines of what people expected from him 10 years ago. Any of the three original tracks on this EP would've fit well stylistically as follow-ups to the prog-skewing aspirations of The Private Press, representing a gradual evolution from his sample-virtuoso approach. As they stand in 2011, these songs are a bit of a mixed bag, flirting with sounds that could qualify as trendy or forward-thinking in bass music without jumping into the thick of it. It's not so much the scattershot styles that register as strange; if there's anywhere hard rock, psych-folk, and electro-glitch all share a root context, it's in the scrapyard assemblage of an ecclectic cratedigger like Shadow. It's more of a structural disconnect, where it's possible to hear what he's reaching for but harder to grasp just how he plans to get there. The title track lurches around in a stoner-rock plod, as a creeping armada of metal guitars eventually bleeds through its slow build to a manic false-ending. The hesher trappings are novel enough, but its drums are uniquely Shadow's: clipped yet heavy-sounding snares, hi-hats, and claps that sound culled from a dozen long-buried sources, but which coalesce into a dense vortex of percussion. The other two originals debuted last year as a digital single, and if they're both distinctly Shadow, they also prove how nebulous that descriptor really is. ""I've Been Trying"" leans toward the same vaguely soulful psych-folk that informed ""Six Days"" and ""This Time (I'm Gonna Try It My Way)"", but it sounds less like an actual sample-based construction than a song with overdubs-- it's one of those cuts that might feel more alive if the seams were less concealed. ""Def Surrounds Us"" is the more intriguing proposition, Shadow loosely toying with dubstep in a somewhat self-aware mode. The Southern-bounce digital snare rolls and hornet-sting synthesizers approach Benga's more jittery moments, but only until the song takes a left turn into glitchy drum'n'bass. It may be the most manic thing he's done since the similarly structured ""Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain"", and it's proof positive that he can still do exhilarating, spectacular things with drum breaks. Out of three additional remixes, the one that pulls it off the best ironically has the weakest source material: Various' take on ""I've Been Trying"" scatters that track's weedy vocals into lonely dub echoes, bringing out the same sense of isolation with a completely different mood. The other two-- Irn Mnky's Pendulum-style ""Swagger Mix"" of ""I Gotta Rokk"" and Rockwell's twitchy, overstuffed remix of ""Def Surrounds Us""-- show just how tacky contemporary drum'n'bass bombast can be, weirdly managing to use all the prominent elements of their originals to create remixes that miss all the things that make Shadow's tracks slice instead of bludgeon. At least the first three tracks prove that Shadow himself still knows how that approach works.","Drawing singles from his forthcoming album, DJ Shadow's latest flirts with trendy, forward-thinking sounds in bass music without jumping into the thick of it.

It's All True,Junior Boys,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af80ea9e61561daa6471/1:1/w_160/60ae1ee0.jpg,2011-06-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15507-its-all-true/,Domino,"Junior Boys started out making ridiculously complex music that had the intimate feel of a bedroom-based indie project. They'd mastered the intricate rhythmic syncopations of UK garage and Timbaland-style R&B, genres that had turned inventive and impossibly tricky rhythm programming into a game of pop oneupsmanship. Which is hardly the sort of thing that you'd want to hear an amateur's take on. But JBs' music was presented as if it were something fragile, homespun, made on a shoestring, full of negative space where the pop fizziness should be. It added an interesting, affecting friction to a sound that had defined glossy marquee pop around the turn of the millennium, like the difference between a love song written to please millions and one aimed at a special someone. Pretty quickly, though, on 2006's So This Is Goodbye and especially 2009's Begone Dull Care, the JBs music started sounding like a million bucks, whatever it cost to make. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. There had always been an element of slick soulful 1980s synth-pop in their sound, and when they jettisoned the new millennium R&B touches, it was shocking and enjoyable to find out they actually had the production chops to mimic that 1980s opulence. But what about that one-on-one intimacy that had originally made them stand out? In that sense, It's All True sounds like the album the Junior Boys have been moving toward their whole career. It's got the same low-key mixtape-from-a-lover charm as Last Exit, but sacrifices none of the appealing slickness of their last few albums. Opener ""Itchy Fingers"" is actually a bit of bait-and-switch. It's the most deliriously dense tune on the album-- multiple basslines, stuttering R&B breakdowns, Art of Noise vocal stabs, zapping rave riffs, gleaming Japan/Duran-style guitar-- a master class in just how much you can squeeze into a track without its seeming cluttered. It recalls the carefully plotted textural overload of UK funky producers like Ill Blu, even if the feel is still more disco-house smooth than frantic Jamaican ragga. But ""Itchy Fingers"" is more or less an anomaly. It's All True mostly dials back the sonic excess in favor of more streamlined grooves. Thankfully, the album also corrects the lack-of-hooks problem that occasionally plagued Begone Dull Care. ""Second Chance"" is still stuffed with whirling video game noises, and some glorious creamy vocal multi-tracking, but what stands out on first listen is that naggingly catchy bassline. Plus Jeremy Greenspan gives us his best batch of choruses in quite a while, and good thing, too. While this is still headphone music par excellence, all those gleaming little sonic gewgaws and sneaky ear-worm off-beats are often pushed to the back of the mix, meaning the bright lounging-on-the-yacht electro hooks and Greenspan's voice both have to do a lot more work here. Greenspan's singing is the best it's ever been on It's All True, proving the band's mixing desk skills aren't the only thing that's matured over the past eight years. Where he initially sounded wounded and winsome, almost hiding his voice behind the stark beats, here he displays a bouncy, strident sense of playfulness. Just check the ecstatic peak-after-peak outro on ""Banana Ripple"". There's also a new subtlety to his breathy just-out-of-bed tenderness that weirdly reminds me of Sam Prekop, no faint praise considering Prekop is the reigning master of this sort of thing. And speaking of subtle and tender, along with the large helpings of dancefloor joy, some of the album's most immediately arresting moments are its sparsest and most fragile. ""The Reservoir"" is an ultra-delicate experiment in seeing how far a rhythm can be stripped back-- something that would have fit perfectly on Last Exit, though it sounds far richer here, with Greenspan pulling off a falsetto he never would have been able to in the old days. Despite a few curveballs, like the pinpoint precise homage to Kraftwerk and the bleep techno Kraftwerk inspired on ""Kick the Can"", there's not much ""new"" here if you've been following the Junior Boys' sound over the last decade. But considering they seem to have perfected that sound here, it's hard not to feel like they should keep making albums like It's All True for a long, long time.","On their latest full-length, Junior Boys find a middle ground between the tricky production of their early work and later 1980s-indebted opulence.

These Trails,These Trails,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af855e6ef95969321e04/1:1/w_160/f3d5fc51.jpg,2011-06-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15508-these-trails/,Drag CitySinergiaDrag CitySinergia,"These Trails was recorded in Honolulu in 1973 and originally released in a small private pressing, and it is one of those rare albums whose backstory is almost wholly audible in the music. Primarily written and performed by singer-songwriters Margaret Morgan and Patrick Cockett, the album has long circulated among fans of obscure psych-folk, and it has been reissued several times in perhaps-not-entirely-legit versions. The album's reputation is well-earned, as These Trails is a lovely and incredibly evocative slice of Pacific folk-rock, and Drag City has performed a good service by finally reissuing the album in a handsome new authorized edition. The musicians behind the creation of These Trails were never even officially a band-- they played no professional gigs together and made no other recordings. (Which is why there are no outtakes or bonus materials included with this reissue.) Margaret Morgan and Patrick Cockett lived together in Hawaii in what sound like idyllic circumstances, writing and playing songs based largely on the majesty of their natural surroundings. The duo was joined in the studio by singer-guitarist Carlos Pardeiro and Dave Choy, a studio engineer who embellished the group's acoustic material with what was then a state-of-the-art Arp synthesizer. The addition of these vintage electronics helps to give the album a slightly off-kilter wobble, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that would echo decades later in the work of Stereolab and Broadcast. For the most part, however, the music on These Trails sounds as though it could have been created only in its own specific time and place. Like many of the best psych-folk documents of the era, the album seems to have been produced in a completely irony-free environment, and it has a sense of guilelessness that would be virtually impossible to reproduce today. Morgan sings in a voice highly reminiscent of Joni Mitchell, but with a distinctive island lilt of her own. Throughout the album she harmonizes with Cockett in a manner that sounds both unique and effortless, backed chiefly by acoustic guitars, dulcimer, and Choy's mysterious burbling Arp. Lyrically the album abounds with references to local Hawaiian landmarks, flora, and vocabulary. Songs such as ""Our House in Hanalei"" or ""Waipoo"" can serve as a sort of personal guidebook, with Morgan and Cockett pointing out various natural features along the trail. (""Banana leaves describe the breezes... gingers grow, where white buds lay sleeping."") Especially evocative is ""Rusty's House"", which describes a visit to the front porch of surfer Rusty Miller, whose remote home was accessible only by foot, in an account so vivid that the listener can practically feel the sunshine and taste the pot smoke. Even more transporting are the album's instrumental interludes ""Psyche I"" and ""Psyche II"", on which Choy gently explores the Arp's cosmic possibilities. These mildly trippy moments aside, most of the action on These Trails remains firmly affixed in the verdant Hawaiian soil. The songs are short and melodic, and the musicians avoid many of the indulgences that mar so many psychedelic albums of the time period-- there are thankfully no prolonged organ solos or overt references to The Lord of the Rings. Patrick Cockett has gone on to perform with such artists as Buffy Sainte-Marie and Taj Mahal, but by all evidence the enigmatic Margaret Morgan, who passed away in 2004, never recorded again. This fact makes These Trails seem all the more like a snapshot from an exquisite but fleeting moment in time. And though it is interesting to speculate where their music might have gone from here if the artists had continued to write and record together, there is no denying that they captured something special on These Trails, and while the album plays that seems like enough.","Drag City reissues this lovely and evocative slice of Pacific folk-rock in a handsome new authorized edition.

I have overcome MANY TRAGEDIES! My PARENTS are FAMOUS!"" Tongue-in-cheek and perhaps a little too 2008, that blurb suggests the perspective of a guy who considers himself an outsider: a Lawrence, Kansas, native who's so far removed from any popular scene, whether it's Brooklyn or San Francisco or Montreal, that he can only look on with chagrin and perhaps a bit of scorn. Lonely Twin, Geiger's second album as Hospital Ships, seems preoccupied with centers and margins, inclusions and exclusions: ""Open up the door and let me in,"" he sings at the beginning of opener ""Love or Death"". ""Open up the door, time's getting thin."" Geiger is not really an outsider, though, at least not in the way that, say, Jandek is an outsider. Lawrence has always had a pretty good scene, and before launching Hospital Ships, Geiger did time in Shearwater, the Appleseed Cast, and the Minus Story. Members of those groups comprise his backing band on Lonely Twin, a big step from his 2008 LP, Oh Ramona, which was essentially Geiger solo. A multi-instrumentalist who favors keyboard and embellishments, he pulls out all the stops on these new songs, arranging and sometimes over-arranging them for maximum impact. The album is bursting with ideas, most of which work pretty well. On ""Little Dead Leaf"", he slams the drums up against the accordion in a skewed near-waltz, as though determined to keep the song afloat for a few more measures. The keyboards, however, sound like they're emanating from a ship that's just sunk beneath the waves, suggesting a sense of seasick unease. Because Geiger hails form the Midwest and sings in a high, androgynous voice that recalls late-90s indie rock, Hospital Ships bear repeated comparisons to the Flaming Lips (who inspired Geiger's stage name). Unlike that band, however, he doesn't excel as a maximalist, as the bombastic ""Reprise"" proves. Repeating its refrain to the point of tedium, the song strains for impact but never quite achieves it. Perhaps a more apt comparison is to the Woodstock Americana of Mercury Rev, who likewise specialize in immersive arrangements and nuanced falsetto. Geiger's songs are densely arranged, yet strikingly, almost uncomfortably intimate, especially the disquieting hush of ""Phantom Limb"" and the fatalistic march of ""Carry On"" before it erupts into a Biblical din. There's a dark undercurrent of dispossession coursing through these songs, which sound measured and conflicted even as they grasp for meaning and import. That generosity of spirit suggests Geiger knows that everyone, even Canadian collectives and celebrity kids, is an outsider looking in.","Having played with Shearwater and the Appleseed Cast, Jordan Geiger releases his second album of dense-yet-intimate psych-pop as Hospital Ships.

A Different Compilation,Buzzcocks,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8b13d197565213a2d0/1:1/w_160/9b92feb0.jpg,2011-06-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15516-a-different-compilation/,Cooking Vinyl,"Buzzcocks were a different kind of punk rock band. Though inspired by the savage fury of Sex Pistols, the Manchester-based quartet founded by Pete Shelley and future Magazine leader Howard Devoto directed that energy toward explosively melodic songs that located their punk politics not in universal slogans or transgressive gestures but in personal anxieties. And Buzzcocks are still different today. The buzzsaw-sharp songs from the band's late-1970s peak have aged better than most, continuing to influence new generations of musicians. The group's more recent reunion albums and tours, moreover, have done nothing to diminish that formidable legacy. A Different Compilation, which brings together new studio recordings of 24 of Buzzcocks' most vital songs, can be seen generously as another example of the band's willingness to stand apart. ""The original records now sound like demos,"" Shelley explains in the press materials. ""These new versions, honed by years on the road, showcase the songs as we know they should be, the way we know audiences love to hear them."" On the other hand, there's a reason the originals have grown so beloved, and anyone unfamiliar with the band would still be better off starting with 1979 classic Singles Going Steady; diehard fans wanting to hear newer recordings of the old songs, meanwhile, might already be content with 2007's 30 or other Buzzcocks live albums. Plus, there's a whole mixed history of artists re-recording their hits, from the unfortunate K-Tel oldies remakes to Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's more imaginative Greatest Palace Music. Just in 2008, also on Cooking Vinyl, college rockers Camper Van Beethoven had to re-record a few songs for a best-of compilation due to label conflicts. Hand-wringing aside, this is a well-chosen set of compelling songs, and if new recordings can probably never match the charm of Buzzcocks' originals, there's still a certain modest appeal to hearing one of punk's most celebrated catalogs given a brawny, contemporary treatment. Where Singles sets out iconic singles like ""Orgasm Addict"" and ""Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)"" next to their B-sides, A Different Compilation also delves into Buzzcocks' often-underrated album tracks, from Ralph Nader-nodding Another Music in a Different Kitchen opener ""Fast Cars"" (here shorn of its introduction quoting the 1977 Spiral Scratch EP's ""Boredom"", ostensibly because that track now precedes it) to guitarist Steve Diggle's Dookie-predicting ""When Love Turns Around"", originally from 1993's Trade Test Transmissions. Then again, though these hard-hitting versions of such memorable punk-era nuggets as ""Harmony in My Head"" and ""Why Can't I Touch It?"" start from only the strongest source material, A Different Compilation lacks the adventurous spirit that helped make the band so worth compiling in the first place. Buzzcocks are often credited with inventing punk-pop, but that genre's modern-day conventions weren't so solidified then-- think of the difference between early disco records and the disco of Village People and Saturday Night Fever-- and there's little here musically you might not hear from some of the band's lesser descendants. And, too, it's not exactly as if there's a huge audience clamoring for re-recordings of late-70s and early-80s Martin Hannett productions (Joy Division, New Order), which is what we're given here in the form of ""Boredom"", fellow Spiral Scratch track ""Breakdown"", and Diggle-fronted former B-side ""Why She's a Girl From the Chainstore"". So while A Different Compilation definitely isn't a starting point for newcomers to Buzzcocks, it's nothing more or less than a novel document from one of punk's defining bands-- and one of the few from punk's first wave that's still a going concern, at that. ""When people put punk rock records on in 1976, 77, they had to rethink their whole lives,"" Diggle told Pitchfork's Patrick Sisson in a January 2009 interview. ""It changed your consciousness, the way you looked at the world, just like powerful records should.""

iTunes Session,Best Coast,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af939d034d5c69bf4731/1:1/w_160/1a341a52.jpg,2011-06-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15524-itunes-session/,Mexican Summer,"Last Tuesday, as Best Coast's iTunes Session hit the web, Bethany Cosentino strung together two tweets: ""since every1 is asking,"" she began, ""yes, best coast will record another record this year... got a lot of songs already written and a lot more to write. life has been pretty nuts therefore i have a lot to write about!"" Much like the iTunes session Vampire Weekend shared just before the Christmas holiday, this Best Coast record feels like something of a victory lap at the end of a flagship year. Since the release of her L.A. outfit's debut splash, Crazy For You, Cosentino's profile has ballooned. For an artist on a small independent label, she sold a boatload of records. She joined tourmates Weezer on-stage. Alongside VW's Rostam Batmanglij and Kid Cudi, she lent her face and voice to a cross-pollinating Converse campaign. Her relationship with Wavves' Nathan Williams provided onlookers and press alike the opportunity to coronate them as a new, less terrifying Kurt and Courtney. She met and touched Justin Bieber. And with the addition of near constant touring, it's not hard to understand what she means by ""life has been pretty nuts."" Best Coast began as one in a long list of lo-fi, beach-oriented pop projects. Easy to file. But as heard here, Cosentino's voice has grown quite a bit since. When listened to side-by-side with a handful of her early, far grimier singles, Crazy For You is a comparatively bright and shiny affair. Recorded in East West Studios, the very same room that helped birth Pet Sounds, these sessions promise another upgrade in fidelity. Hearing a song like ""Something in the Way""-- a crud-covered 7"" cut-- really belted makes for a completely different listening experience. Sure, there's some distortion kicked up in the chord changes, but as she details in a half-hour interview included with the iTunes purchase, the stripping away of effects is still an ongoing process. She's becoming confident in her singing. So ""Crazy For You"" sounds totally refreshing here, the chorus hook of ""Boyfriend"" sharper than it's ever been before and ""Goodbye"" receives a deserved upgrade as well. With the exception of ""Our Deal"", a Crazy For You sleeper that's been extended in service of some waterlogged atmospherics, these slightly tweaked new versions are often superior to the originals. ""When I'm With You"", arguably her sweetest slice of pop to date, is near flawless. But placing Cosentino's vocals in the limelight also comes with its share of drawbacks, namely the attention it brings to holes in her songwriting. Whatever you think of her weed- and boy-crazy sensibilities-- and plenty admire their simplicity and directness-- it's clear after listening to her give everything she's got to a cover of Loretta Lynn's ""Fist City"" that she's a far stronger singer at this point than she is a lyricist. If her songwriting has come along as much as her voice has in the past year, that won't be the case much longer.","Drawing from Crazy For You and earlier singles and tossing in a cover, Bethany Cosentino takes a well-earned victory lap.

Arabia Mountain,Black Lips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af70c0084474cd0c1a94/1:1/w_160/6f4102b6.jpg,2011-06-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15494-arabia-mountain/,Vice,"There comes a time in every rock'n'roll band's career when they have to decide whether to get out of the garage or stay mired in the grease. Black Lips seem to want it both ways. With the release of their fourth studio album, 2007's Good Bad Not Evil, the Atlanta rockers saw their audience expand well beyond the garage-punk underground, thanks to a new alliance with Vice that yielded fawning New York Times profiles, Conan O'Brien appearances, and Virgin Mobile ad placements. At the time, a Hives-sized crossover success didn't seem out of the question, but the Lips seemed to handily kibosh that possibility with 2009's 200 Million Thousand, a sprawling mess that seemed designed to prove Black Lips could still out-scuzz and out-slop the lowest of the lo-fi. The band's decision to record Arabia Mountain with Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson is surprising, not because they're at odds aesthetically-- the two camps do share an affinity for 1960s retro recording techniques-- but because of the timing: hooking up with an A-list producer is the sort of move that would've made more sense two years ago, to capitalize on Good Bad Not Evil's mainstream-breaching momentum. But whether they're responding to Vice's vocal dissatisfaction with 200 Million Thousand or following the example of their late friend Jay Reatard-- whose 2009 swan song Watch Me Fall saw him cleaning up his buzzsaw-pop sound without compromising his essence-- Black Lips seem more eager to play ball this time around. And unlike previous cautionary examples of garage-rock bands teaming up with Top 40 hitmakers (the Hives and Pharrell, the Mooney Suzuki and the Matrix), Ronson thankfully doesn't try to make Black Lips into something they're not. Though an early single had the loaded title ""New Direction"", Arabia Mountain sticks to the same Nuggets-style playbook that's governed all previous Black Lips releases. Ronson, who produced nine songs and mastered another two recorded with Deerhunter's Lockett Pundt, simply gives the band the most faithful faux-60s production money can buy. If anything's changed here, it's Black Lips' point of emphasis on the Nuggets spectrum: Arabia Mountain draws less from the sinister psychedelia of the 13th Floor Elevators or the deranged blues of early Beefheart, and more from the toga-party-rockin' likes of the Sonics and the Premiers. So it favors the more amiable aspects of 60s garage-- frathouse-rocking saxophones, songs inspired by comic-book superheroes and baseball mascots, and grooooovy singing saw-- over anti-authoritarian attitudes and fuzzbox abuse. Black Lips have never been shy about showing off their playful side, but in the past, these moments (Let It Bloom's poignant, poor-boy ballad ""Dirty Hands"", Good Bad Not Evil's outsider anthem ""Bad Kids"", 200 Million Thousand's sober-up pledge ""Starting Over"") nicely complemented their more raucous rave-ups, revealing a sincere softer side to the band's notorious delinquent image. With Arabia Mountain exuding a mostly cheeky and cheerful demeanor, you do lose some of the oppositional tension between innocence and insolence that always distinguished Black Lips from the garage-punk pack. And with a somewhat bloated 16-song tracklist, the album's abundance of open-roof Thunderbird anthems-- ""Go Out and Get It"", ""Time"", ""New Direction""-- starts to feel somewhat interchangeable. But Arabia Mountain's chiseled production and considerably tighter songcraft provides a better forum for showcasing the band's subversive sense of humor. The best songs here play up the dichotomy between their retro sound and modern preoccupations: bad acid trips at the Louvre (the Yardbirds-ish freakbeater ""Modern Art""), exotic fad diets (the breezy Beach Boys-via-Ramones romp ""Raw Meat""), and post-recession survival tactics (the spot-on country-Stones send-up ""Dumpster Diving""). And in anticipation of those old-school fans who might view Arabia Mountain as a calculated act of careerism, the Lips throw a late-game curveball with the queasy closer ""You Keep on Running"", a creepy haunted-house trawl that finds Cole Alexander issuing the title's warning in a high-pitched squeal that's equally unnerving and silly. Its inclusion sends a none-too-subtle message to anyone who thinks they've got Black Lips all figured out: Arabia Mountain may be poised to push this band further over-ground, but they're not going up without a fight.","Working with producer Mark Ronson to get the best 1960s-style production sound money can buy, Black Lips have crafted a very solid album.

Canta Lechuza,Helado Negro,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af69ea9e61561daa6450/1:1/w_160/e27ec125.jpg,2011-06-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15489-canta-lechuza/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Roberto Lange makes Latin-tinged electro-folk music under the name Helado Negro (Spanish for ""black ice cream"") and a recent stint the woods of Connecticut seems to have had a curious impact on his music. Most of Canta Lechuza (which translates as ""Owl Singing""), the second full-length offering from the Helado Negro moniker, feels like something of a one-man vacation. The compositions conjure images of lantern-lit patio parties and lightly narcotized comet-gazing, with less focus on the folkier aspects that shaped his debut, Awe Owe. From the outside looking in, Canta Lechuza shares something with Destroyer's latest LP, Kaputt. Like the latter record, Canta Lechuza finds an artist ignoring his established pastoral leanings while sailing into smoother waters in a style that touches on kitsch. But instead of Bejar's ornate, romantic bluster, Lange is more interested in negative space, noise, and subtlety-- starry-eyed crooning, celestial background textures, and slinky rhythms crafted around bass plinks and plunks that seem to have been stolen from some Barcelona nightclub and slowed to a crawl. But back to all that noise. Lange is clearly in the mood to experiment, letting more traditional instruments take a backseat while he fiddles with electronic equipment, peppering nearly every track with whirs, burrs, clicks, and clacks. He occasionally takes time to build distinct grooves from all these little pieces (""Cenar en La Manana""), but more often than not, his fiddling is distracting. It's such a pleasure getting wrapped up in the dreamy ethers of a song like ""Lechuguilla"", you can't help but feel a bit slighted by the fact that Lange didn't choose to dial it back a bit. Not all of the experimentation is quite so invasive. This is, after all, a record that was composed in the wilds, and Lange's ability to channel his surroundings affords Canta Lechuza an important transportive quality. ""El Oeste"" concludes with a serrated swell that recalls a summer thunderstorm, while ""Calculas"" features lightning bug synth flashes. Best of all are the heavily processed blurts on ""Oreja De Arena"", which provide Lange with what sounds like a belching bullfrog as a backup singer. When Lange goes with the flow and allows elements like this to permeate his music, Canta Lechuza is at its best.","This Latin-tinged electro-folk project takes a rustic turn with intriguing results.

ISAM,Amon Tobin,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8e13d197565213a2d7/1:1/w_160/9ce52c39.jpg,2011-06-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15519-isam/,Ninja Tune,"This is theoretically a fantastic time for Amon Tobin to return to form. The Montreal producer cut his teeth on drum and bass in the late 1990s, proving time and again he was one of the genre's most creative practitioners. Meanwhile, for the past two or three years, labels like Med School, Critical, and NonPlus+ have helped free drum and bass from a creative stasis. Tobin, though, has never really been one for movements, or revivals of movements. His career interests span tasteful breakbeat jazz, aggressive storms of percussion, and moody video game soundtracks. Until 2007's Foley Room, every direction had been underpinned by the orchestral and jazz samples Tobin favored working with. ISAM, the densest, most fractal album of Tobin's career, again abandons sampling in favor of digitally altered samples of Tobin's own. It is a collaboration with London-based visual artist Tessa Farmer, whose work is heavy on scary looking bug-warrior skeletons. Tobin sings for the first time, though his vocals are ""gender modified,"" sometimes sounding like a woman, but more often like a cipher for his machines. This level of obfuscation contrasts the familiar, jazzy samples that marked his work for so long. Even when Tobin's tracks were hustling along at 180 bpm, his considered sampling afforded them a structural grace. In abandoning his long-held methods for concepts-- both musical and extra-musical-- Tobin's work has come untethered. ISAM cuts closer to Autechre's entropic electro than anything in Tobin's catalog. At times, during the opening moments of ""Mass & Spring"" and ""Night Swim"" for instance, Tobin approaches psych-y drone music. ""Goto 10"" is a mechanistic lullaby, while ""Journeyman"" indulges in a slow-leak bass fantasy. These are deconstructions all. Nowhere on ISAM does the beat congeal around a head-nodding tempo, nor can Tobin's melodies stroll for long before finding a cliff's edge. It's hard to imagine ISAM accompanying another artist's work: It is by no means gallery-pleasing mood music, and its constant stops and starts are immensely distracting. Tobin used to be a dependable, dedicated craftsman, but he's intent on transitioning to full-on sonic artist. He has the ideas: ISAM's pieces keep wandering into unmarked industrial zones, evoking broken things and blight. But this is heavy, foreboding music; Tobin hasn't yet learned how to balance his robust sound-art impulses with footholds for his listeners. He'll get there-- he's frankly too talented not to-- but ISAM feels like a transitional album, for his fans if not for him.","Montreal producer's latest, a collaboration with London-based visual artist Tessa Farmer, abandons sampling in favor of altered bits of Tobin's own design.

Loud Planes Fly Low,The Rosebuds,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7d5e6ef95969321df1/1:1/w_160/ed927571.jpg,2011-06-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15505-loud-planes-fly-low/,Merge,"Loud Planes Fly Low isn't a break-up album. It may be the Rosebuds' first release since the divorce of founding members Kelly Crisp and Ivan Howard, but it's not your typical aggregation of romantic grievances set to minor keys. In fact, they avoid blame and accusation altogether in favor of a more generous and balanced accounting of loss and renewal. After all, the duo decided to continue its musical partnership, which entailed figuring out how they could work together solely as bandmates. Loud Planes documents not the dissolution but the redefinition of their relationship; it's a staying-together album, which not only makes it much more interesting but provides a persuasive argument for their musical compatibility. The two have always made their relationship part of the band's story: Crisp and Howard formed the Rosebuds the week they got married in 2001, adopted stage/married names Kelly and Ivan Rosebud, and titled their debut The Rosebuds Make Out. Even in post-split, the band is still bound up in its dynamic, as they try to find new ways to dramatize their relationship musically. Loud Planes alternates their vocals in a he said/she said sequencing, as if pleading their cases to each other and to the listener; no matter who takes the lead, the other sings in the background, as if nodding in sympathy or understanding. ""I want to feel something way out here,"" Crisp sings on ""Come Visit Me"", which has the low-key vibe of a 2 a.m. phone call. ""I need something to happen now, even if it fucks me up."" She trails off on that last phrase, as if reluctant to consider the consequences, but the sharp edge of desperation in her voice makes it one of her most urgent performances to date. Howard describes his own efforts at reconciliation on ""Waiting For You"": ""I tried to make a start, and I tried to come around."" He doesn't need to tell you he wasn't exactly successful. Loud Planes Fly Low is an album about change-- not necessarily good or bad, just necessary and inevitable and immense. Especially coming after 2009's lively Life Like, which was based on demos they recorded for their own amusement, these new songs sound purposefully gray and somber, with cautious tempos and subdued melodies. The atmosphere is thoroughly melancholy, which is understandable, but at times the album sounds acutely oppressive-- like trying to breathe on another planet. Even on closer ""Worthwhile"", there's no release, no conclusion or epiphany to throw everything into sharp relief. Perhaps that's the nature of Crisp and Howard's partnership now: never quite settled, never quite comfortable. But for the listener, Loud Planes may sound oddly open-ended-- a transition album in every sense.","A decade into its musical partnership, the indie pop duo crafts a transitional album focused on renewal.

An American Trilogy,Mickey Newbury,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af53ea9e61561daa6428/1:1/w_160/29ce8f73.jpg,2011-06-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15473-an-american-trilogy/,Drag City,"The years preceding the American Bicentennial were especially good ones in Nashville. Not only did country music graduate from a rather large niche market to the mainstream, but the talent on the city's periphery began to insinuate itself into the center, as songwriters like Guy Clark, Kris Kristofferson, Donnie Fritts, and Willie Nelson attracted so much attention that the scene became known as the ""New Nashville."" In practice, this group of musicians raised hell all over town and wrote aching songs with unpretentiously poetic lyrics, passing their compositions up the ranks for royalties and notoriety. A few became stars in their own right: Nelson's Red Headed Stranger was a critical and commercial hit, and Kristofferson became the scene's sex symbol. But some of the most talented songwriters simply faded into the background, with albums that were invariably praised by critics but largely ignored by listeners. Despite a robust voice and a thoughtful way with medleys, Larry Jon Wilson retreated to Augusta, Georgia, but managed a comeback just prior to his death last year. Mickey Newbury, disgusted with industry politics in Nashville, absconded to the mountains of Oregon, releasing albums on his own label until his death in 2002 (his final record, A Long Road Home, was recorded between oxygen treatments for emphysema). Some of the scene's success can be attributed to Newbury, a Houston native who wrote hits for Tom Jones, Don Gibson, and Kenny Rogers (if you've heard ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"", then you've heard Newbury). He also hung around with and influenced a younger generation of local songwriters, many of them similarly Lone Star expats; you can hear him in Kristofferson's sing/speak phrasing and in Nelson's complex narrative undertakings. Even today, he remains a songwriter's songwriter, lionized by a new generation of musicians including Will Oldham, Nick Cave, and the Black Swans' Jerry DeCicca (who says he got the job producing Wilson's 2009 comeback album based on his thorough knowledge of Newbury's catalog). Drag City's new bundle of reissues-- which includes three albums plus a set of rarities from the late 1960s and early 70s, released separately on vinyl and together in a 4xCD set titled An American Trilogy-- portrays Newbury as a man out of time and out of place, even among his friends in the New Nashville scene. With his gently grainy voice and folksy phrasing, he was country more by proximity than by sound, and he incorporated jazz, R&B, and folk elements into his forward-thinking music. These three LPs are all heady concept albums of a sort, sequenced to create and sustain a particular mood of grievous loss and precarious composure. Newbury conceived them specifically as a trilogy examining his own romantic past as well as the country's contentious history, and 40 years later, they sound just as imaginative, evocative, and emotional as ever. Looks Like Rain, from 1969, was actually Newbury's second album. Just a few years prior, RCA had paired him with a producer who lent his songs a too-slick sheen that Newbury detested. When he re-recorded them, he kept closer control on the music, casting the songs as spare, lonely ruminations on lost love and lost opportunities and barely masking his own depression. But there's always dignity in his despondency, and there's always something rumbling in the background of these albums: the crisp guitar and ghostly doo-wop vocals on ""33rd of August/When the Baby in My Lady Gets the Blues"", the otherworldly choir on ""San Francisco Mable Joy"", the mournful harmonica on ""Looks Like Baby's Gone"". There's real space on these albums, which are so lonesome and introverted that Newbury's flourishes of sound are less an accompaniment to his vocals than his fond memory of music half-remembered. Looks Like Rain is, quite literally, rainy-day music. The songs are interspersed with samples of a downpour, which reinforces the sense of back-porch reverie. It ought to be corny as hell, a tired gimmick meant to literalize certain aspects of the songwriting. The effect, however, not only allows the album to cohere into a listen-in-one-sitting experience, but reinforces the emotional alienation of these songs. Newbury liked the idea so much that he repeated it on subsequent albums-- a musical element as distinctive as an artist's signature on a canvas. Those interludes and other musical flourishes stitch these albums together as a whole effort, not inseparable but certainly more powerful in each other's proximity. Another of Newbury's signatures was his fascination with old American songs. Arguably his biggest hit was ""An American Trilogy"", a medley from 1971's 'Frisco Mabel Joy that interlaced ""Dixie"", ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"", and ""All My Trials"". It was at that time a contentious piece of music: At the tail end of the civil rights movement, there were calls to ban ""Dixie"" for its slavery connotations and sympathies, although Elvis Presley's over-the-top Vegas cover helped dispel some of that controversy. Newbury's arrangement is conceptually fascinating, as it pairs a southern song written by a northerner with a slave spiritual imported from the Caribbean. Musically, however, it sounds overly serious and antiquated, almost quaint-- more an artifact from the period than a durable piece of music. And yet, ""An American Trilogy"" reveals Newbury's complex approach to songwriting and album sequencing: Every word or line or stanza or song complements the others and shades their meanings, contributing crucially to the whole. On all of these albums, his songs shift and melt into other songs, creating thoughtful medleys and often devastating juxtapositions-- such as the one-two punch of ""How Many Times (Must the Piper Be Paid For His Song?)"" and the gorgeous synth theme of ""Interlude"". That means songs like the relatively spry ""T. Total Tommy"" on Looks Like Rain and ""Why You Been Gone So Long"" on 1973's Heaven Help the Child stand out all the more strongly for being so self-contained. On the other hand, it means Better Days, a disc of demos, live recordings, and rarities, sounds particularly jarring in this set for not cohering into a more powerful whole. The songs themselves are strong, in particular a version of ""Why You Been Gone So Long"" that rivals Johnny Darrell's hit version, but they work primarily as songs, not as pieces of a larger whole. When he was living in Nashville and even after he headed as far west as he could go, Newbury strove to capture something larger and more powerful than a song or even an album. This handsome set doesn't suggest exactly what he was trying to find, only that he never found it. That fate adds another layer of melancholy to these monumentally sad songs, but leavens any sense of depressiveness by showing us Newbury's obvious creative zeal. It's that sense of discovery, coupled with his unflagging belief in the purity of a well-crafted song, that makes these albums resonate as powerfully today as they ever did.","Newbury was a visionary country music outsider, and this collection brings together three albums and rarities from the late 1960s and early 70s.

Suck It and See,Arctic Monkeys,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3913d197565213a249/1:1/w_160/77c43260.jpg,2011-06-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15450-suck-it-and-see/,Domino,"A gang of surly teenagers gives away music for free online, makes light of the industry's established byways, and somehow manages to sell records at a time when overall album sales continue to dwindle. It's a familiar storyline these days, but when Arctic Monkeys' precociously jaded Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest-selling UK debut ever, back in early 2006, the idea of a ""MySpace band"" was still something new. Now, with News Corp. reportedly trying to sell MySpace and other sites such as Bandcamp and Tumblr taking the struggling social network's place in music think-pieces, the Sheffield band's latest is a throwback in a more classic sense. Suck It and See, the Arctics' fourth and most rewarding album so far, is not music to blog to. Listen while updating your Facebook status or crafting the perfect tweet, and you're probably going to miss something crucial. Actually, you're probably going to miss something anyway: For instance, the title, while no doubt partly intended as a provocation toward American audiences, is mostly just easily misunderstood Brit-speak for ""give it a try."" But the record itself brims with endlessly replayable details, some goofy and some poignant, both in frontman Alex Turner's always keenly observed lyrics and in the band's ever-proficient music, the latter of which ranges here from muscular glam-rock to chiming indie pop balladry. Cowboy movies and humdrum observations about the weather conceal thoughtful contemplations on romance and coming of age. ""Oh, in five years' time, will it be, 'Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?'"" That was Turner five years ago. Fittingly, Suck It and See is something of a reboot for the band. 2007 sophomore effort Favourite Worst Nightmare, the Arctics' first album with Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford producing, found the group enriching its palette both emotionally and sonically, while musically toughening up. 2009's Humbug paired the group with Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, leading to predictably brawny, unwound results. Elsewhere, Turner's once-shouty voice ripened into a honeyed croon with 2008 side project the Last Shadow Puppets, and his recent solo soundtrack for Richard Ayoade film Submarine allowed him to unplug. The new record, produced by Ford but with a burly backing vocal from Homme on the churning ""All My Own Stunts"", sounds informed by each of these experiences, distilling them all into the unit's next phase: confident, melodic, and as expertly played as ever. Turner has been talking up country greats Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Patsy Cline as lyrical influences on this album, along with Nick Cave, the Byrds, Nick Lowe, David Bowie, and Leonard Cohen. When he's at his clearest (which is still pretty heavy with ambiguities), Suck It and See has a bleak sense of humor to prove he's not kidding. That's fleshed out by bandmates whose tastes run more toward Black Sabbath stomp or Stooges aggression. Musically, drummer Matt Helders remains the Arctics' not-so-secret weapon, capable of lizard-brain freakouts or deceptively innocent waltzes; Sean Combs has invited him more than once to sit in with Diddy Dirty Money. So hardly a verse goes by without an instant quotable or two, and the backing is elegant enough that at first you might not even notice. ""Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair"", a swaggering boogie worthy of its title, lists off dangerous ideas that are all presumably less dangerous than sitting down (""Do the Macarena in the devil's lair""-- you know, the usual). Plucky ode ""Reckless Serenade"" has a hell of an opening line: ""Topless models doing semaphor/ Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored."" Other times, Turner keeps his cards so close to the chest that trying to puzzle out literal meanings would probably be impossible, though his disconnected imagery is usually still pretty compelling. These songs tend to be heavier, more fuzzed-out: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid nod ""Black Treacle"", which envisions ""belly-button piercings in the sky at night"" (how careful are Turner's word choices? This careful: ""Now it's getting dark, and the sky looks sticky/ More like black treacle than tar""); ""The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala"", which juxtaposes memorably impressionistic verses with searing, yes, sha-la-la-la choruses; ""She's Thunderstorms"", as tempestuous and captivating as its female subject. Only jagged, mathy ""Library Pictures"" fails to hold interest. For a band whose breakthrough hit was called ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"", Arctic Monkeys have always been perhaps unexpectedly great at gentler moments. On that score, Suck It and See is a thing to behold. The heart-wrenching ""Love Is a Laserquest"" addresses a lost love every bit as unsparingly as past Arctics slow burners ""Do Me a Favour"", ""Cornerstone"", or ""A Certain Romance"", picking up a lyrical theme that also runs throughout an album by a very different band, Fleet Foxes' Helplessness Blues: ""Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now?"" Finale ""That's Where You're Wrong"", in the steadily escalating two-chord format of LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"", furthers this concern with the passing years: ""Don't take it so personally, honey/ You're not the only one that time has got it in for."" Now there's something you don't see every blog-second: a group that grew up too fast, aging gracefully.","With Alex Turner's bleak sense of humor and agile lyrics-- and music that nods to Sabbath or the Stooges-- the Sheffield band continues to surprise.

Our Lives Are Shaped By What We Love: Motown's MoWest Story 1971-1973,Various Artists,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af889d034d5c69bf4721/1:1/w_160/86d9c9b2.jpg,2011-06-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15514-our-lives-are-shaped-by-what-we-love-motowns-mowest-story-1971-1973/,Light in the Attic,"Frankie Valli was one of the most successful pop artists of the 20th century. In addition to a successful solo career, his work with the Four Seasons resulted in an incredible 71 chart hits; more than half of these made the Top 40, and eight of them topped the charts. His hit-making prowess even bucked the album-oriented trends of the Sgt. Pepper's era, but there were some hiccups along the way. One of the most notable was a stint with Motown's short-lived MoWest imprint in the early 1970s, where Valli found himself in a slump. After a few disappointing swings at the charts, Valli tried to release ""My Eyes Adored You"" in 1974. MoWest passed on the record. Valli released the song late that year as a solo artist on Private Stock Records, and it topped the Billboard Hot 100 by March of the following year, ending the artist's stint on the label and kickstarting a new era of success. This story is a microcosm of MoWest's inauspicious reign as the forgotten moment of one of the most iconic labels in the history of pop. The creation of the imprint was part of Berry Gordy Jr.'s gradual shift of Motown operations from Detroit to Los Angeles, away from the assembly-line production of the label's peak years. The Holland-Dozier-Holland team had already departed, replaced in part by Norman Whitfield and a raft of superstar auteurs: Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Diana Ross. The shift to Los Angeles also marked the end of the singular Detroit sound, as the label became reliant on a rotating cast of session musicians. But even with all the upheaval, it's difficult to figure out why MoWest fell through the cracks; the music contained in Our Lives Are Shaped By What We Love: Motown's MoWest Story 1971-1973 is almost uniformly great. The compilation showcases a wide range of notable artists-- a 1971 Billboard article notes the label's purpose was to ""expand Motown's musical horizons""-- at varying stages in their careers. It was an indisputably exciting time, creatively, for soul music, in the years before disco became a codified sound. Stevie Wonder, near the beginning of his incredible decade-plus solo creative run, does make a behind-the-scenes appearance on this compilation, producing the tracks from Syreeta's debut LP. Both are highlights. Odyssey, not to be confused with the disco group of the same name, contribute three songs; each, but particularly the uptempo flute-laden horn-driven dance number ""Battened Ships"", is a compelling example of a kind of post-hippie spiritual 70s soul. There are also early career appearances from future superstars the Commodores and Thelma Houston, whose ""I Ain't Going Nowhere"" includes an inspired vocal performance. Rock group Lodi, on the other hand, may have marked an attempt on Motown's part to move towards a psychedelic-cum-acid-folk sound, but their ""I Hope I See It in My Lifetime"" feels aimless, without the kind of memorable songwriting that defines the bulk of this compilation. Perhaps the best moment on the collection is one of the record's best-known, at least to American dance floors. Although still an obscure cut by any reasonable standard, the Sisters Love's ""Give Me Your Love"" manages to completely reinvent Curtis Mayfield's original. With its heart-damaged vocals, the song manages a rare balance of driven vulnerability over an endless, inimitable groove. It's a strong document of the pre-disco era, but also an example of one way these oddities could endure (in this case, seeing a resurgence in a later floor-friendly edit), whatever its chart success. The primary common denominator here is that none of these artists sold well at the time. (MoWest's one hit in the United States, Tom Clay's ""What The World Needs Now Is Love"", is not included.) But whatever the commercial obstructions, the music certainly holds up.","This collection of obscurities from the ill-fated early-1970s Motown offshoot proves to be a surprisingly strong document of pre-disco pop and soul.

Iris,Tom Trago,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af869d034d5c69bf471d/1:1/w_160/9b0dd3a0.jpg,2011-06-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15512-iris/,Rush Hour,"Arriving in the context of 2011 dance music's taste for niche, Tom Trago's new album Iris feels almost refreshing for its ""broad church"" style of eclectic populism. It wanders through a variety of dance sub-genres (admittedly all variations of house and techno) with that air of assumed ownership that used to be the hallmark of big statement dance music albums in the late 1990s. It wasn't ever thus: the Dutch producer's 2009 debut, Voyage Direct, was a rigorously focused throwback to lo-fi second wave Chicago house disco loops, as tunnel-visioned as any purist could hope for. Whether intentional or not, Iris feels like a stab at main stage crossover by comparison, a short-circuit bid for the kind of statesmanship long enjoyed by Carl Craig. Iris even sounds like the kind of album Carl Craig might make if he got down with vocal house more intently. It cycles between dreamy, spacey, exquisitely produced mood pieces and surprisingly upfront but still painstakingly airbrushed vocal house (this time splitting the difference between first wave Chicago and brassy New York divatude), all wrapped up in a sensibility of rhythmic looseness swiped from 80s R&B. The rhythms are the album's key drawing card, fluttering and flexing with delectable voluptuousness-- a surprise given the uncompromising straightness of Voyage Direct. Trago also has a light touch with gently murmuring basslines and sweeping synth chords, wrapping them around his rhythms like so many layers of fairy floss. In fact it's difficult to think of a recent dance album so unabashedly pretty at all times, deploying its top-shelf production nous to caress, rather than impress, its audience. The gorgeous, delicate Metro Area shimmy of ""Being With You"" is a particular delight. All of which should make Iris pretty compelling indeed, and I've puzzled long and hard over why it's, somehow, not. The short answer is that the vocal tunes that ought to provide the album's highlights are almost uniformly underwhelming, capturing everything but the bittersweet euphoria that is vocal house's most noble contribution to culture. On moments like the stagey soul of ""Suckers For Fools"" (whose repetition of its title could move less patient listeners to acts of self-harm) or the classicist diva workout of ""Gave Me the Love"", Trago is nothing if not scrupulous, pulling out every possible production trick and arranging with infinite care and attention to detail the succession of melodic and sonic motifs that confirm he has studied the masters. But the key to crafting truly transcendent dancefloor anthems is to conceal within them an indefinable intensity-- physical, emotional, or preferably both-- that can't be reduced to their sonic signifiers. Trago comes close to this only once, on the aching and undulating synth-disco strut of closer ""Corrupt"". It's not that Trago can't do intensity. Although I'm not sure that it was the superior album, at its best Voyage Direct certainly generated a great deal of dancefloor friction. But his advance on the center stage takes him into territory well-worn with the footprints of giants of the form. To complain that Trago struggles to match the anthemism of Armand Van Helden, the lush soul of Moodymann, or the sheer physical presence of Paperclip People may be unfair, but, well, life is short and filled with great records covering the same beat. You'd probably be better served spending your time with those records, but if the prospect of inconsequential but exquisitely constructed tributes to past glories appeals, then Iris' eagerness to please probably won't lead you astray.","The Dutch producer returns with a mix of techno and vocal house that is gorgeous on the surface but harder to crack on a deeper level.

Leisure Seizure,Tom Vek,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af825e6ef95969321dff/1:1/w_160/e07cea61.jpg,2011-06-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15510-leisure-seizure/,IslandDowntownCooperative,"British songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Tom Vek popped up in the mid-2000s as part of a wave of clever, twitchy, studio-centric punk-funk acts following on the early success of the Rapture and DFA. He wasn't necessarily part of that scene, but he benefited from having a fashionable context, and so his debut album, We Have Sound, was a modest success. After that record, Vek essentially disappeared from the pop landscape as he went about setting up his own studio and gradually piecing together his second album, Leisure Seizure. Waiting six years to follow up a debut record is not usually a good move, but it has worked out well for Vek. Since indie music fashions have moved on since 2005, he no longer comes across as being part of a larger trend, and his idiosyncrasies are more apparent. He's dropped a lot of the post-punk tics of his debut, but his emphasis on rhythm remains, with nearly every track built around a crisp, precise beat. His compositions are neat and tidy; he cycles through textures and sounds but avoids clutter and unnecessary doubling of parts. There's a ruthless efficiency to his music that can be very attractive, but even at his best, Vek sounds like a producer just on the verge of finding his own distinct style. Vek's voice, often flat and heavily accented, is alternately one of the most appealing and most off-putting elements on Leisure Seizure. He's very good at affecting a petty, bratty tone, and this suits the bitter, confrontational character of album highlights ""A Chore"" and ""Aroused"". Vek has a limited vocal range, but it's obvious that he's put a lot of thought into how to play to his strengths and switch up his technique. At some points he exaggerates his flatness for effect-- for one particularly successful example, he drags out his syllables over the swinging beat of ""We Do Nothing"" to convey a sense of boredom. He's most compelling when he employs a sinister singsong on ""A Chore"" and the semi-rapped ""World of Doubt"", casting himself as something of an antagonistic presence. Unfortunately, Vek's voice outstays its welcome by the middle of the album. Leisure Seizure is front-loaded with its best material, such that the second half of the record becomes rather tedious. ""Close Mic'ed"", a slow-moving ballad, is an admirable experiment in pushing for greater range, but his voice just isn't fully suited to the material and ends up spoiling the track's subtle dynamics. Other cuts on the second side, such as ""You Need to Work Your Heart Out"" and ""On a Plate"", just feel overworked and uninspired. There's a spark missing on these numbers, and the most exciting elements of Vek's style become grating as a result. It doesn't spoil the high points on the album, but it does make us yearn for a more consistent and fully realized Vek record. Hopefully we won't have to wait until 2017 for that.","Six years after his debut, the British producer crafts a follow up, losing some of his older work's post-punk tics but keeping an emphasis on rhythm.

Remixes 2: 81-11,Depeche Mode,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8113d197565213a2c2/1:1/w_160/3abc7485.jpg,2011-06-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15511-remixes-2-81-11/,Mute,"A few seconds into Tigerskin's remix of ""In Chains"", a pro forma Martin Gore song from 2009's Sounds of the Universe, there's a startling sound-- a little two-note metallic clank, off-pitch but ear-grabbing in a way the rest of the track (and most of the album) isn't. It's the opening noise of Depeche Mode's 1984 single ""People Are People"", or something a lot like it, and it's a reminder that the band used to be about sound as much as mood and tune and personality. The first decade's worth of Depeche Mode songs were eminently remixable, because they almost all had sonic signatures: You could put together a terrific version of anything on, say, Some Great Reward without even using their melodies or vocals. ""Personal Jesus"", from 1989, got over on its glam beat and a sneering electric guitar that the band treated like the coolest new gizmo they'd ever encountered. But for the past 20 years-- and especially since Alan Wilder left in 1995-- their arrangements sound more like the work of a generic band-that-uses-electronics, and most of the remixers here don't replace them with anything particularly distinctive either. As its title suggests, the 3xCD Remixes 2-- also available in a condensed single-disc edition-- is a sequel to another brick of a set, 2004's Remixes 81-04. That collection consisted mostly of fondly remembered mixes that had appeared on Depeche Mode's 12"" singles over the years, with a few newly commissioned reworkings of old favorites. Since then, they've released two awful-ish studio albums, whose single remixes are drawn on heavily here, along with a bit of barrel-scraping for passable older stuff, like Gareth Jones' 1985 remix of ""Fly on the Windscreen"", and another smattering of new interpretations. There are some big names here: UNKLE, M83, Trentemøller, Dan the Automator (who sadly doesn't take on ""John the Revelator""). Few of them are doing anywhere near their best work, because they generally don't have much to work with. There's some good stuff here anyway, probably a really solid EP's worth. Röyksopp's ""Puppets"" reaches all the way back to a 1981 album track-- it's effectively a half-rewritten cover of the song rather than a remix proper, but they sound like they're having a blast. It's fun to hear the two ex-members of Depeche Mode each remixing a song written after his departure-- Vince Clarke does ""Behind the Wheel"" and Alan Wilder does another version of ""In Chains"". Digitalism's take on ""Never Let Me Down Again"" takes advantage of its one-note melody to build up a head of scalding digital distortion. And of the three mixes of ""Personal Jesus"" here, one is pretty good. (That would be the one by Stargate, who are big enough Depeche Mode fans that they snuck a musical quote from ""Master and Servant"" into Rihanna's ""S&M"". Their version is also one of only three tracks on these three discs to come in under the four-minute mark.) Mostly, though, this is a depressing reminder of the distance between what Depeche Mode once were and what they've become.","A sequel of sorts to 2004's Remixes 81-04, this 3xCD set chronicles remixes from the band's last two albums, with a few old favorites for good measure.

David Comes to Life,Fucked Up,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af875e6ef95969321e07/1:1/w_160/9fbf2f8f.jpg,2011-06-08 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/,Matador,"Punk rock has had its share of ambitious bands producing ambitious records-- Double Nickels on the Dime, Zen Arcade, Sandinista!, and The Shape of Punk to Come spring to mind-- but few groups in this sphere have pushed the envelope as often as Fucked Up. For the last few years, they've been releasing singles as part of a series based on the Chinese Zodiac, each of which usually runs over the 10-minute mark. For a 2007 charity Christmas single, they managed to get James Murphy, Nelly Furtado, and ""Degrassi: the Next Generation""/""90210"" actress Shenae Grimes (among many, many others) to appear on the same song; during a 12-hour (!) NYC concert in 2008, they got moshers to smash along to Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig doing Descendents covers. Their reach continues unabated on their new album, David Comes to Life, a 78-minute rock opera. The story of David Comes to Life is fairly complicated and, at points, heavily meta. It concerns a factory worker named David Eliade who falls in love with a woman named Veronica Boisson. They conspire to build a bomb together and death, destruction, and redemption follow; along the way, the story's narrator does battle with David for control of the plot. There's a long tradition of rock concept albums that aren't easy to understand, and this one is no exception; but enjoying it doesn't depend on decoding the tale. The record is divided into four separate acts, with a narrative focus that shifts from scene to scene-- a few songs are told from the overarching narrator's perspective, while David's ex-girlfriend, Vivian Benson, offers her side of the story in the album's back half. While a few guest vocalists are employed to help out-- Cults' Madeline Follin and singer/songwriter Jennifer Castle represent Veronica and Vivian, respectively-- the story is largely told by the band's screaming frontman, Damien Abraham, aka Pink Eyes. Taking into account the album's relatively limited range-- almost an hour and a half of straight-up bashing and riffage, with moments like the jangly acoustic figure that opens ""A Slanted Tone"" as a rare respite-- it becomes apparent that you will need a few listens and a lyric sheet to apprehend David Comes to Life's ambition and follow its labyrinthine storyline. Or, you could just sit back and let the record's dense, visceral blast of guitar squall wash over you. More than any single Fucked Up record, David Comes to Life is thick with walls of noisy melody. It's hard to get a handle on just how many guitar tracks are on a given song, and Shane Stoneback deserves a medal for mixing the sheer bulk of the sound into something so clear. But for all the shoegazey textures and blistering sonic assault, David Comes to Life is also direct and immediate. Hooks are piled on top of hooks, bursting through torrents of spacey noise (""I Was There"") and peppy rhythms (""The Recursive Girl"") alike. At points, the primal appeal of the blunt and effective riffing even brings to mind the bar-band rock of the Hold Steady. Out front, Abraham still retains his scorched-earth bark. He's been finding ways to broaden his voice's impact, and it's never sounded better than it does here. Abraham knows his range and limitations and is finding new ways to work within them while adjusting to the band's forward lurch, in effect becoming another instrument in the mix. His stomping melancholia on ""Turn the Season"" feels like a gut-check, while he follows up his sole quiet moment on album closer ""Lights Go Up"" by shouting amidst curled screams, ""I'm still in love with you/ After all of this time!"" Besides the aforementioned appearances by Follin and Castle, Kurt Vile delivers a typically slack backing vocal on ""Lights Go Up"", too-- but, really, this is The Pink Eyes Show, and it's never been so compelling to watch. That said, all the howling and the album's extreme length might be a tough thing for those new to Fucked Up. For people in this category, it might be best to check out Hidden World first; it's a good representation of how fun and hooky Fucked Up are when they're in the zone, and in many ways it's a simpler, spiritual precursor to this record. Regardless, David Comes to Life is absolutely worth the commitment, a convincing demonstration of what can happen when a band works without limitations.","Toronto's Fucked Up continue their outsized ambition with a lengthy rock opera featuring a twisted storyline and epic guitar-driven songs.

EAR PWR,EAR PWR,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7b5e6ef95969321dee/1:1/w_160/45d84477.jpg,2011-06-07 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15503-ear-pwr/,Carpark,"EAR PWR's 2009 debut, Super Animal Brothers III, a neon-lit mess of Devin Booze's synth glitch smeared together with Sarah Reynold's squeaky voice, was a testament to party-ready arrested development. It could also be irritating. As Pitchfork's Brian Howe mentioned at the time, ""It's hard to get mad at the fun,"" but EAR PWR often made it look easy. Fast-forward two years and EAR PWR have relocated to North Carolina and become something of a different animal. Removed from the spazzoid Wham City warehouse scene, the pair almost seem ready to embrace maturity. Right from the ominous opening synth stabs on ""Mountain Home"", it's apparent that something is different. Amidst the goth vibes, freaky drum pattern, and weird vocal melody, you know that EAR PWR are making a conscious effort to create serious-sounding music. EAR PWR's sound here feels indebted to the Brooklyn outfit Glasser, with the juxtaposition of tribal drum programming against celestial analog synths (Booze's are homemade) and an ethereal vocalist out front. For EAR PWR, this evolution is admirable, but it's hard to overlook how clumsy the molting process is. For starters, Reynolds' flat delivery doesn't really work next to Booze's beefed-up (and sometimes inventive) synth work, which itself is often upstaged by his overbearing drums and invasive cymbal splashes. But having Reynolds recede into the background, given some of the awkward lyrics, isn't such a terrible thing. All in all, the record seems thin and unbalanced, its disjointedness revealing how little substance there is here. What's even more frustrating are the sparks of real possibility that keep popping up: ""Geodes"" pairs the pulse of a tornado siren with twinkling synths and some thrashed-out, forward-tumbling drums; ""Lake"" is the kind of shy, sexy jam these two should be focusing more of their attention on. But in context, these more sophisticated reflections are either draggy or misguided (""North Carolina"", an ode to the duo's new home, seems meant to be regal and idyllic but sounds more like theme music from The Oregon Trail). EAR PWR were once a band that refused to tie a tie or recite the silly rule-- it could be annoying, but at least they were being themselves. Here, they prove how hard growing up can be.","The spazzy electro-pop duo has moved from Baltimore to North Carolina and acquired a new, more mature sound.

Reflection,Chalk Circle,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af33b1335d7bf1699eda/1:1/w_160/b9b7c52c.jpg,2011-06-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15441-reflection/,Post Present MediumMississippi,"For just over two years, Washington, D.C.'s Chalk Circle were a staple in the city's early-80s punk scene, part of a group that included (but was assuredly not limited to) both Ian MacKaye and Henry Rollins (then known as Henry Garfield). But while Rollins and MacKaye built lasting legacies off the strength of their 80s work, Chalk Circle have been regulated to cult-hero status, revered by in-the-know punk fans-- including No Age's Dean Spunt, who is responsible for co-releasing this anthology on his PPM imprint. Aside from Chalk Circle's rare live performances-- they played only four shows-- their obscurity could have something to do with the way their slippery post-punk didn't fit in with the righteous (if slightly homogenous) thrashing of their peers. Don Fleming points out in the liner notes that the band had even hoped for some releases on the increasingly influential Dischord Records, but the label ultimately decided they did not fit on their roster. And while that was true for the majority of their slender output, ""The Slap"" and ""Scrambled"", with all their dissonance and half-shouted lyrics, would have made for a perfect Dischord 7"". Built around the songwriting partnership of Sharon Cheslow and Mary Green, Chalk Circle's sound fit in nicely with peers the Slits and the Raincoats, all creators of an innovative brand of post-punk. Reflection opens with its title track, and Green's introspective lyrics ensure it lives up to its name, while Cheslow's guitar dances around Tamera Lyndsay's bassline and Anne Bonafede's polyrhythmic drumming. ""My drumming was heavily inspired by the Tony DeFranco song 'Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat',"" Bonafede states in the liner notes. ""As a matter of fact, all of my drum riffs were variations of that song."" Just like the Slits and Raincoats, Chalk Circle were ahead of their time, with ""Uneasy Friend"" adopting uneasy back-and-forth vocals and a similarly jittery energy, and closer ""Subversive Pleasure"" presaging not only modern punk bands such as Mika Miko and the Coathangers, but the entire riot grrrl movement of the late 80s and early 90s. Perhaps due to her interest in poetry, Green was a pretty remarkable lyricist in a genre where words were used primarily as rocks to throw at the glass windows of the establishment. ""The Slap"" uses the image of violence against women as a metaphor for initiation into society, while ""The Look"" is an almost-satirical glance into patriarchal standards of female beauty. On ""Reflection"" and ""Easy Escapes"", Green turns the lens on herself, forging personal takes on romance and life. ""Love songs don't touch me,"" Green sings on the latter. ""But is that what I really want?"" With exception of ""The Look"" and the rough mix of ""Easy Escapes"", the best work on Reflection has already been released via early-80s tape compilations. The previously unreleased five of the album's 12 songs were live tracks and basement demos, which serve more as interesting sketches than vital documents. Peppered throughout the album, they provide rough-hewn counterparts to their studio-recorded work. They're not terribly essential, but they definitely provide a deeper context to the band's history. ""We wanted to have a band because we loved playing music and listening to music,"" Cheslow states in the liner notes. ""We saw girls from N.Y., L.A., San Francisco, and London playing in bands and they gave us inspiration and courage."" In 2011, the notion of an all-girl band is just as important as it ever was, primarily because we're still using the term ""all-girl band"" as if predominantly female rock groups were still a novelty of some sort. While women are unfortunately still fighting to be treated as equals-- even in the so-called ""liberal utopia"" that is underground rock music-- it becomes increasingly necessary to shed a light on the female bands that time left behind, especially ones as prescient as Chalk Circle. Reflection offers a broadly overlooked chapter in not just the history of women in American punk rock, but the history of American punk rock overall.","All-female cult punk group from D.C. is chronicled with this 12-song overview of its brief career, thanks to No Age's Dean Spunt's PPM imprint.

Larceny & Old Lace,The Coathangers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5ab1335d7bf1699f20/1:1/w_160/0a9e56ce.jpg,2011-06-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15478-larceny-old-lace/,Suicide Squeeze,"When the Coathangers formed five years ago, as something of a party joke, the band's four members had little musical education to speak of. But they're no joke now, having since released a pair of riotous albums, plus about a half-dozen trashy, cheeky, shrieking 7"" singles. They're also grizzled road warriors, headlining bars from Fargo, N.D., to Allston, Mass., in between supporting gigs with the likes of the Thermals, Mika Miko, and These Arms Are Snakes. Somewhere in all that, the Coathangers must've learned how to play. Larceny & Old Lace, the quartet's third album and second for Seattle-based Suicide Squeeze, carries over the chaotically hooky vitality of their previous records. But here, they've added more varied songwriting, (relatively) tighter instrumentation, and-- for the first time-- a real studio, the Living Room in Atlanta, where the band reunited with producer Ed Rawls (Deerhunter, Black Lips, Zoroaster). Named after a Mickey Rooney-guesting ""Golden Girls"" episode that was itself named after playwright Joseph Kesselring's screwball comedy Arsenic and Old Lace, the Coathangers' latest finds a notorious must-see live band finally capturing some of the energy of its shows on record. Just because the Coathangers are taking their game more seriously doesn't mean it isn't still a game. With all four members trading off idiosyncratic vocals-- ranging from guitarist Julia Kugel's Victoria Jackson chirp to drummer Stephanie Luke's full-throated roar-- there's still plenty of jagged, playful aggression, whether that involves damning the titular jerk of ""Johnny"" over gloomy post-punk or tearing off faces between stabbing guitar and whirligig keyboard on ""Chicken: 30"". But the Coathangers now pay more attention to detail, starting with first single ""Hurricane"", which veers from raspy shouts and brittle guitar riffs to zombie-apocalypse cheerleader chants and ominous whispers shaded by clacking drumsticks. They also try on more styles: Where ""Call to Nothing"" pledges ill-fated devotion through scratchy guitar and heavy bass recalling the Slits, ""Well Alright"" rides a demented roadhouse blues and ""My Baby"" slows down to a loping love groove-- for stalkers. These might not be the furthest-out ideas, but they're new for the Coathangers, and they're executed with badass charisma. Still, from the band behind such shrill yawps as ""Don't Touch My Shit"" and ""Gettin' Mad and Pumpin' Iron"", there's no bigger left turn than a soft, sentimental ballad. ""Tabbacco Rd."" sees the Coathangers making the shift with surprising ease, poignantly following a relationship from its first Tom Collins to the wedding chapel, and finally to the last goodbye. Speaking of goodbyes, the kitschy-scary keyboard and cathartic howls of ""Jaybird"" make it a fine memorial even if you don't recognize the lyrical reference to the Coathangers' former tourmate, the late Jay Reatard. Most impressive of all, though, and a should-be single, is ""Go Away"", a perfectly structured midtempo rocker that turns the tables on every dude who ever sang a whiny song about wanting to be more than just friends. It may have started as a simple gag-- ""Hey, I like you/ Go away""-- but it's as serious as you want it to be.","Atlanta quartet's third album maintains the chaotic vitality of their previous records with a more polished sound.

Suede [Deluxe Edition] / Dog Man Star [Deluxe Edition],Suede,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6e13d197565213a29d/1:1/w_160/84a890c2.jpg,2011-06-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/,Demon,"There is music on these albums. Obviously. The reason I'm saying that up front is that discussion of the first two Suede albums is invariably framed in a discussion of the bigger picture, both in terms of what was happening in British rock in the early 1990s and in terms of the discord within the band, particularly during 1994. There are good reasons for this. Suede were at the center of the conversation that gave us the Britpop narrative that so dominated the UK in the mid-90s. They were the band on the cover of the issue of Select that invented Britpop as a concept, they were massively hyped before they even released anything, and their debut album was the fastest-selling in British history. They were ignored in the United States and ridiculously had to change their name in this country to the London Suede after a lawsuit by an obscure lounge singer. This stuff is all important to understanding who Suede were-- the music they made, especially on their first three albums, is tied closely to their story as a band-- but I really want to make sure that as I make my way through that story, the music doesn't slip to the side of the conversation. Stories and meta-cultural narratives aside, the music is what we have to listen to now, and there is a lot of great music spread over these elaborate reissues. The whole band, including once-estranged original guitarist Bernard Butler, was involved in putting together these packages, each of them a 2xCD/DVD featuring the original album, demos, unreleased outtakes, every contemporary B-side (plus one non-album A-side), music videos, interviews and live performances. The band's entire output, with the notable exception of three early unreleased tracks, ""Be My God"", ""Art"", and ""Wonderful Sometimes"", is now available on five very well-done reissues that include all of the original artwork for both the albums and the singles. They have curated their past well. Consider the arena this band was entering when it debuted in May, 1992 with ""The Drowners"". The British rock world was dominated by two waning trends, shoegaze and Madchester, both of which emphasized sound and vibe over personality and pomp. And here Suede were, with a very bold, direct, and sexually charged song that had the swagger of glam rock and was focused on the voice of Brett Anderson, who was powerful and distinctive. Anderson's vocals had a little of Bowie and a little of Morrissey, but there was a lot more there than a simple swirling of influences. Here was a guy who could sing frankly about drug abuse and rough sex without plasticizing it or stylizing it-- actions had consequences in the world he created, and wild nights had mornings after, but he was careful not to tell you the moral of the story. It wouldn't always be like that, but during the brief years Butler was still in the band, Anderson was at his best as both lyricist and vocalist. The band had a good rhythm section, too. Bassist Mat Osman is a subtle force in the band, playing melodic lines that keep the songs light on their feet, even when Simon Gilbert's drumming locks in on a stomping and otherwise heavy beat. When they matched up with Butler's guitar, they were nearly as charismatic as a trio as the guy who was singing for them. ""The Drowners""-- which for all the early hype around the band (they were on the cover of Melody Maker a month before its release under the headline ""The Best New Band in Britain"") only charted at #49-- has a destructive energy to it that I can understand hearing as a clarion call in the musical climate of Britain in the early 90s. The opening drum stomp, soon joined by Butler's crunching, metallic riff, seems to announce the band as something different and exciting. It drips with sex before Anderson even opens his mouth. ""The Drowners"" is joined by three other excellent singles on the band's self-titled debut. ""Metal Mickey"" was the band's only song to chart in the U.S. top 10, and it is one of their best-- Butler didn't play much conventional rhythm guitar, and this song is a good early example of how his shifting lead style complemented Anderson's vocal melodies. The singles reinforced the idea that Suede were a breath of fresh air, and even though they are fairly basic rock, the band still didn't sound quite like any of their contemporaries. And there are the album tracks as well, which showed them to be a band with considerable range. The interplay between Anderson's vocal and Butler's lead guitar on ""Sleeping Pills"" is like some sort of dance, and the band makes a convincing modern murder ballad on ""She's Not Dead"". And Mat Osman's bass does as much to drive the quieter songs as Butler's guitar. Between albums, the band released a non-album single, ""Stay Together"", that signaled a shift in direction. By this point, Britpop was a real thing, at least as far as the UK music press was concerned, and Suede were being lumped in with Oasis, Blur, Cast, and a host of other bands that were being championed as the saviors of British rock. This horrified Anderson, who felt his band had very little to do with the laddish groups he was being mentioned in the same breath with, and it strengthened his resolve to move the band further away from conventional rock. Butler's relationship with the rest of the group was deteriorating; on the band's messy American tour in late 1993, he sometimes left the stage mid-gig, having a member of the Cranberries, who were opening, fill in for him. Anderson sequestered himself to write, and the songs he came up with were much darker and more introverted than anything on their mostly demonstrative debut. By all accounts, the recording sessions for Dog Man Star, the band's masterpiece, were fraught with tension, and Butler often recorded separately, ultimately leaving the band before the album was completed. Whether that tension helped or hurt the album is debatable, but what's not in dispute is that the album is the band's very best work, completely transcending the Britpop wave they'd supposedly helped launch. In many ways, it's more like an album that might have been released in the 70s than in the 90s, and not just because of its heavy glam riffs and towering vocals. It does everything to its extreme, is unafraid of excess or bombast, and is well-structured to play as a cohesive work. From its eerily throbbing, weightless opener, ""Introducing the Band"", to the orchestral overload of its sweeping closer, ""Still Life"", there's not a moment on the album that doesn't feel in danger of breaking down, flying apart, or disappearing entirely. It's a thrilling record. I can't think of anything that's been released since that has quite the same balance of elements. It was enormously risky, but the risk paid off with big returns. Where Butler did play, he played his most inspired parts. ""New Generation"", ""We Are the Pigs"", ""Heroine"", and ""This Hollywood Life"" thrash and churn; ""The Asphalt World"" caps its slow burn with a wild and lengthy instrumental coda; and ""The Wild Ones"" might be Suede's best single, its sweeping orchestration, vocals, and guitar parts coming together in fragile but perfect balance. The quieter songs are stunning. ""Daddy's Speeding"" ends in a torrent of static and sampled engine noises that sounds like the earth tearing open, and ""The 2 of Us"" is simply gorgeous, a devastatingly sad song that doesn't feel forced or morose. The reissue appends full-length versions of ""The Wild Ones"" and ""The Asphalt World"" that are significantly longer, and they're worth hearing, as are most of the other outtakes. The demos that fill out the first discs after the albums are marginally interesting, but the essential inclusion on these sets is the B-sides, all of them, from every single the band released through early 1994 (some recorded after Butler left are on the Coming Up reissue). Suede made B-sides that a lot of bands would die to release as lead singles-- their Sci-Fi Lullabies compilation, now redundant, has long been considered an essential part of their discography, and for good reason. Here, you get the elastic snap of ""Whipsnade"", the stomp of ""Killing of a Flash Boy"", the breezy swagger of ""Modern Boys"", the majesty of ""My Dark Star"", the crystalline sadness of ""The Living Dead"", and the shimmer of ""To the Birds"" right alongside the albums, and they alone make these sets worth the price. Anderson even makes alternate tracklists in his liner notes for each album, which often swap out weaker album tracks for B-sides, and I can't really argue with any of his substitutions (dropping ""The Power"" for ""My Dark Star"" and ""Black or Blue"" for ""The Living Dead"" might have been the only way to make Dog Man Star better). The DVDs are full of good stuff-- Suede comes with all of its charmingly dated music videos, and Dog Man Star has the concert projections for the band's 1994 tour, though that album's videos are oddly absent. Each set has two live performances-- and strangely, all but one appear to have been shot by audience members rather than professionally, though the sound is acceptable. They were a very good live band, but honestly, as with most bonus DVDs, these are likely to be watched a few times and shelved. It's not bad to have this stuff available, though. More importantly, the band's discography has been consolidated, and their first two albums feel more complete with the contemporary B-sides in tow. Suede were an important band, pivotal to what the 90s came to sound like in Britain, even if they distanced themselves from it. But Suede were also a great band, and these records still sound vital all these years later.","Suede's first two albums, key documents of the music of 1990s Britain, are reissued with a generous helping of bonus material.

Gloss Drop,Battles,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4eea9e61561daa6420/1:1/w_160/2e0f23ec.jpg,2011-06-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15469-gloss-drop/,Warp,"Let's get one thing out of the way: Gloss Drop shouldn't really be compared to its predecessor, Mirrored. The sole Battles record to feature Tyondai Braxton's digitally cartoonified vocals, Mirrored is now consigned to brilliant one-off status in the Battles catalog; Gloss Drop, created after Braxton left the group entirely, is more of a refinement and expansion of Battles' early work. In a way, for fans, the loss of Braxton was the best thing that could have happened to Battles. It meant they couldn't record a true follow up, which might then pale (or just come off as more of the same) next to one of the most distinctive and unexpected debut LPs of the 21st century. Battles could have recorded an all-instrumental album in the Mirrored mold, or they could have drafted in another singer to try and imitate Braxton's crucial contribution. Instead, they forced themselves, having lost their most immediately striking and divisive element, to move in a new and potentially radical direction. So the important questions with Gloss Drop become, ""Is this new direction interesting?"" and ""Have Battles made it thrilling?"" The answers are: ""Yes,"" and ""More often than you might guess."" Mirrored was an album that made its impact via complexity and speed and wild humor, a sound that owed as much to the orchestral zaniness of classic cartoon soundtracks as the grimmer heads-down virtuosity of the metal and math-rock bands in which the Battles members made their names. Not only could these guys pull off these wild instrumental zigzags at high velocity, they made ultra-tricky, computer-assisted pop-prog sound like fun. For their circumstances-dictated new direction, Battles have slowed their roll a bit, foregrounding both the pop and propulsive qualities of the music rather than its can-we-top-ourselves inventiveness. It still sounds like devious fun, but the sort you get from a band tweaking audience expectations. Gloss Drop is the most ride-the-groove record Battles have ever made, owing plenty to both the straight-forwardness of house and rock and the crazed syncopations of soca and dancehall, where Mirrored's whole point could seem like leaving listeners breathless with this-could-go-anywhere prog invention. And considering Battles are possibly the tightest man-machine unit going now that LCD Soundsystem are dead, you can imagine how hot these grooves burn, and how meticulously they're constructed, their most audacious attempt yet to make the line between ""programmed"" and ""played"" completely invisible. Of course I say these two albums shouldn't be compared, but that won't stop most people from doing just that. Inevitably the starker differences between the two will leap right out on first listen, but if you're worried about a complete makeover, Gloss Drop still does sound an awful lot like Battles. There's the same blurring until you can't be sure what instrument is responsible for which melodic or rhythmic element of the mix: Are those steel drums all over this record, or a guitar processed to sound that way, or some sort of ""Caribbean"" software patch? There are still the same surging moments when you're reminded, for all the band's post-human rhythmic complexity, what a great rock drummer John Stanier remains. There's still the sense of thrill that comes from music where any element coming loose would mean everything falls apart, and there's the surprise that music this fussed over can still hit so hard. In a way, that's been the constant in their career, and there's often the feeling here that Battles haven't forgotten their pre-Tyondai days, where they seemed to be applying the hyper-detailed structures of math-rock to the feel of minimal techno. Battles' early EPs offered one of those shouldn't-work-but-does hybrids: prog rock, with all its furrow-browed instrumental digressions, that still somehow follows the straight-line pulse of dance music. The difference is that they learned how to be a (far) left-field pop band on Mirrored, and there probably wouldn't be much thrill in ditching that just to look backward. Though the tone remains gleefully plastic and mechanical, Gloss Drop is less forbiddingly dense, chilly, and opaque than those instrumental EPs. ""Sweetie and Shag"", with appropriately dream-pop-esque vocals from Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino, is the most tender song the band's ever recorded, not a praise term you would have previously applied to Battles. If those early records resembled an auditory obstacle course, this is more of a playground, strange but inviting. Not for nothing does so much of Gloss Drop resemble carnival music, both in the ""rides and games"" and ""Caribbean parade"" senses of the word. Sometimes this slave-to-the-rhythm approach doesn't quite come off, as on ""Futura"", where trad dance-rock is just given a frosting of virtuosity. There are moments like this on Gloss Drop where you remember Battles are capable of so much more than trad anything. And there are also times when the joyous silliness that runs through the record becomes oppressive, like the band's hammering you with the fact that serious music can also be super whimsical. But when it all comes together, as it does more often than not, it works on every level. ""Ice Cream"", with vocals from dance producer Matias Aguayo, is both the band's biggest and best pop moment since ""Atlas"", with a real disco bounce, but also totally perverse in its construction, like a mutated Phoenix single. And on ""My Machines"", they even call down that old (literal) tech metal thunder, with the added bonus of a big drama-queen performance from Gary Numan, one of their spiritual fathers in linking electronics with rock. Despite all the guests, and the nods to global pop, Gloss Drop will still be best enjoyed by groove heads, whether they come from the rock or dance worlds, but if you worried Battles would run out of surprises on album two, who knew they'd find common ground between post-punk devotees, Yes fans, and the children of UK funky?","Tyondai Braxton and his distinct vocals have moved on, but Battles remain committed to making complex pop-prog sound like fun. Gary Numan guests.

Sondre Lerche,Sondre Lerche,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7313d197565213a2a4/1:1/w_160/6bef333f.jpg,2011-06-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15496-sondre-lerche/,TelléMona,"The most notable constant in Sondre Lerche's career so far has been change. The restless Norwegian has a wide range of musical curiosities, and in 10 years and seven albums he's covered quite a bit of ground, from the subdued, Nick Drake-inspired folk of Faces Down to the Chet Baker jazz of The Duper Sessions to the harder rock of Phantom Punch. Perhaps his most representative work to date has been the soundtrack to the largely forgotten Steve Carell flick Dan in Real Life, and that's primarily because it shuffles new tracks and scene-setting instrumentals among songs from his previous albums, as if Lerche meant to take stock of his own past. His range is certainly respectable, but also a bit precocious, as if such diversity were an end in itself. So when he self-titles an album-- especially his seventh full-length-- it can't just be out of laziness or lack of creativity. Whether intentional or not, Sondre Lerche does present something like a defining sound, with all the traits that have threaded throughout his albums over the years: the slightly off-key croon, the meticulous attention to arrangement, the emphasis on melody over all else, the impeccable choice of backing musicians (including Vetiver's Bob Parins on harmonica, Midlake's McKenzie Smith on drums, and Lerche's stepfather-in-law on accordion). There are nods to Brill Building formalism, 1970s singer-songwriter fare, subdued bossa nova, and polite power pop, each integrated studiously into the whole. The result might be called indie AOR: intelligent, tasteful, largely unobtrusive, certainly knowledgeable of pop history. It would surprise exactly no one if he ended up recording with Norah Jones (that's not a slam: say what you will about her music, but she has pretty solid taste in collaborators). Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of Sondre Lerche is how willing he is to simply let these songs devour themselves: to fall apart or fade away in unexpected ways. ""Nevermind the Typos"" descends from legible script to scrawled handwriting, as the drums, bass, strings, and guitar play against instead of with one another, and ""Tied Up to the Tide"" closes on an angular accordion solo that's one of the album's most intriguingly jarring moments. This self-destructive impulse makes for an interesting contrast to Lerche's highly organized and precisely arranged pop, but he relegates it to a few asides without really pursuing that chaos-against-order friction. He's simply too bound to order, such that even the runaway chorus of ""Private Caller"" sounds like it knows exactly where it's running away to. The drama of ""Domino"" and closer ""When the River"" sounds prescribed, too scripted for a performer whose live shows suggest a spontaneity that's impossible to recreate on record. For all the mission-statement confidence that its title exudes, Sondre Lerche sounds strangely divided: It's too pristine and too scattershot.","On his self-titled seventh LP, Sondre Lerche nods to Brill Building formalism, 70s singer-songwriter fare, subdued bossa nova, and polite power pop.

Out on the Open West,Frank Fairfield,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7cea9e61561daa646d/1:1/w_160/ed5a97ba.jpg,2011-06-06 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15504-out-on-the-open-west/,Tompkins Square,"Frank Fairfield's backstory is the stuff of old American legend: A troubled vagabond who eventually made his way home to Los Angeles, Fairfield rooted through the city as a street musician, pulling bow across fiddle and hammering away at a banjo or acoustic guitar on corners or in flea markets. One afternoon, the right musician saw him play, became his manager, hitched him to a tour with champions Fleet Foxes, and landed him a record deal with one of the country's most trustworthy syndicates of old sounds, Tompkins Square. Now, he's the subject of a documentary and a touring musician with audiences in multiple continents. In a time where musicians and their managers attend workshops on going viral, and when the companies that own the music plan album leaks in advance, Fairfield simply played because he somehow had to talk about his feelings. Everything else just found him. Fairfield's debut collected his interpretations and arrangements of 11 traditional tunes; Out on the Open West, the follow-up to his 2009 entrée, features three arrangements of traditional tunes, and they're all instrumentals-- the halting ""Haste to the Wedding/The Darling True Love"", the ebullient ""Turkey in the Straw/Arkansas Traveler"", and the foot-stomping ""Texas Farewell"". But the best songs here are Fairfield's own, and they're tremendous achievements from a guy who once said he wasn't a songwriter: ""But That's Alright"" is a sad, spirited bit of self-medication, the title phrase muttered in the chorus with the same kind of bitter resolve that tides people through strings of bad news. On ""Kings County Breakdown"", he bows with a get-out-of-town abandon, like he's racing away from a hard week's work for his favorite vacation spot, or more likely, his baby. ""Ruthie"" is a tender, torturous goodbye. Fairfield is a strong player, but here, he smartly fumbles along the banjo's neck, the lament's lyrical depression mirrored by the broken technique. ""Who will set her coffin? Lord, who will lay her down? Who will lay sweet Ruthie in that cold rocky ground?"" he sings before answering that he will. The despair is overwhelming. Out on the Open West, then, not only cements Fairfield as a remarkable performer but also suggests that he's an evocative writer with his own stories to share. It also puts Fairfield squarely in the folk tradition of collaboration. His self-titled debut was mostly Fairfield. On ""Kings County Breakdown"", though, he's sawing his fiddle alongside mentor and guitarist Tom Marion. That's young colleague Jerron ""Blind Boy"" Paxton singing perfectly content harmonies on ""But That's Alright"" and Old Crow Medicine Show's Willie Watson doing the cheery picking on the title track. But the most remarkable moment in Fairfield's slender catalog is ""Poor Old Lance"", a stunning bit of sadness that puts him squarely in the league of his heroes. Assisted by a trio of fiddle players, Fairfield sings with the sort of human moan that you can hear in Doc Watson's blues or any number of Harry Smith or Alan Lomax's field recordings. These troubles have never seemed more like Fairfield's own. Fairfield is worthy of your consideration, even if you've never heard or considered the old-time music. He plays with a rare integrity, offering up his life in a way that does exactly what folk music must do-- it relates the world as the singer sees it, mixing sadness with sweetness, excitement with low-down and miserable depression. This has nothing to do with genre; hip-hop, jazz and rock all feel this way, too. Like the best of it all, Fairfield's music seems inexorably real and entirely necessary.","The Fleet Foxes tourmate and old-time music practitioner follows an album of traditional tunes with a collection of his own songs.

Make Your Own Danger,Alina Simone,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7ec0084474cd0c1aa8/1:1/w_160/800a1c3b.jpg,2011-06-06 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15506-make-your-own-danger/,Pentar,"Alina Simone lives in Brooklyn but was born in Ukraine, a fact that her work tends to confront either directly or not at all. There was the 2008 album Everyone is Crying Out to Me, Beware, where Simone covered songs by the Siberian folk-punk singer Yanka Dyagileva. There is Simone's new memoir, You Must Go and Win, which addresses ""the lure of a mythical Russian home"" she left as an infant as well as the foibles of the American music industry. And on her new album, Make Your Own Danger, there's a song about Baba Yaga, the legendary Slavic witch whose house walks around on chicken legs. Under its gypsy veneer, it reminds me a bit of the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"", which is telling. The American music business can be a precarious place for homegrown artists with foreign roots, and Simone has generally seemed leery of fetishizing her heritage for American markets. She seems to deploy her background with a mixture of personal interest and business savvy. On Make Your Own Danger, Eastern European folk tropes are pretty scarce, and mainly function as a bit of marketable window dressing for the music Simone really seems to love, vintage alt-rock. This is someone who gave her 2005 debut EP the supremely ""1990s"" title of Prettier in the Dark, and who inherits a tradition that PJ Harvey defined in the 90s and Shannon Wright carried on in the 2000s: strong, intense women with smoldering voices set to melodious yet slashing music. Simone may dream of that mythical Ukrainian home, but she expresses herself in the language of crunchy rhythm guitars, chiming leads, and confessional vocals that has soundtracked her American life. In the beginning, Simone was more like these artists in sound than spirit-- there was something tentative about her earliest efforts. But Make Your Own Danger betrays a growing assertiveness. Its bedrock of coffeehouse singer/songwriter fare and lean, propulsive rock gains distinction and variety with the addition of chamber instruments and hand percussion. It still has the delicate rawness that is central to Simone's music, but with more layers of arrangement than ever before. The flute on ""Apocalyptic Lullaby"" offsets the lumbering doom-folk with welcome lightness, and ""Glitterati"", whose hovering percussion and guitars surprisingly evoke the Walkmen, is one of the most striking songs we've heard from Simone to date-- to say nothing of the Velvet Underground-derived trance she conjures on ""You Fade Away"" or the effortlessly gorgeous ballad ""Just Here to Watch the Show"". Her voice has gotten more formidable too. There are a couple of songs where she's a little smaller in the mix than would seem ideal: ""Day Glow Avenue"" represents the record at its most polite. But for the most part, her singing is both forceful and subtle. It draws out the nuances of lyrics that are full of sinister but deflected evocations of some beautiful oblivion. Pivotal events lurk around every corner here, before and behind, seldom revealed. As someone who seems to always be on the verge of blowing up, that must be a feeling Simone knows well. Maybe her unwillingness to go all in as an American classic or Eastern European curiosity hasn't ingratiated her with a marketplace that likes tidy narratives, and maybe she's getting a little fed up with it. When a shotgun goes off in the harbor on ""Gunshots"", you can hear the bang in her voice.","The Ukranian-American's latest incorporates coffeehouse singer/songwriter fare, lean, propulsive rock, and chamber instruments and hand percussion.

Absolute II,Oneida,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6bb1335d7bf1699f3b/1:1/w_160/b8e6a2e6.jpg,2011-06-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15490-absolute-ii/,Jagjaguwar,"In 2009 the Flaming Lips invited Oneida to play at a day they were curating at an ATP festival in upstate New York. That pairing felt like an inevitable convergence of like-minded talents-- two similarly wayward outfits naturally coming together. Both have gone though stages of late-career reinvention, both have a fondness for repetitive psychedelic rock music played loud, and both have demonstrated scant regard for conventional career trajectories. At that point Oneida were two albums deep into a proposed trilogy titled Thank Your Parents. The fact that they decided to play a 12-hour set, complete with a double drummer assault from Lips sticksmen Steven Drozd and Kliph Scurlock at one point, made a strange kind of sense. It felt like Oneida were in the process of untethering themselves from their own sound, of cutting loose common constructs that had been threaded through their prior work. In Absolute II, the third and final segment of Thank Your Parents, that evolution has been taken to its most far-out point yet. Of all the strands that make up the trilogy, which began with Preteen Weaponry in 2008 and continued with the triple album Rated O in 2009, this is the one that makes least sense as a standalone item. It's very much a part of a greater whole, a logical if somewhat obtuse and reflective way to enter the comedown phase after the wild diversity of the previous installment. With all three pieces slotted together, it's easier to process the other material. The studio trickery and dub-influenced tunes of Preteen Weaponry, which was split into three songs but designed to be listened to as a continuous track, now feels like a perfect ease-in entry point to the sprawl of Rated O. But finding a similar way in to Absolute II takes some work. There are no drums here and barely any vocals. Anything that could be defined as ""traditional"" instrumentation is largely absent. Initially, it feels impenetrable. Almost everything is locked in stasis, with tiny phrases and pulses occasionally prickling to the surface. As such, it's firmly rooted in the minimalist tradition. Steve Reich's ""Pendulum Music"" is a touchstone, as is Philip Glass's ""1+1"". At times it bears a similar textural heft to Brian Eno's work with Harold Budd on their The Plateaux of Mirror collaboration. In terms of eyebrow-raising deviations in style it's not dissimilar to the arcane moods of Scott Walker's Tilt and The Drift. Like Preteen Weaponry this isn't an album that needed to be divided into individual tracks, although there are four of them, beginning with ""Pre Human"". The opening is built around a single repeating keyboard riff that's lightly distorted and sounds not unlike something Martin Rev from Suicide might have left on the cutting room floor around the time of their first album. It feels like a reflex shift out of the jagged edges of Rated O and into calmer waters, especially when it relaxes into solitary organ drones and droplets of water-like piano plinks. But the mood of Absolute II oscillates somewhere between turmoil and ease, with the stretched out tones of ""Pre Human"" ultimately congealing into the hostile atmosphere of ""Horizon"". Here, the solitary vocal lines on the album are cut so they speak a curious un-language, which is set to aggressive machine noise that feels like a feverish itch prickling away under the skin. It's the dark side of Eno's dream for ambient, or the notion of Erik Satie's ""furniture music"" gone horribly wrong. Something that should sink into the background is ultimately turned on its head and shoved in your face instead. ""Horizon"" is painful at high volume, and it's most likely designed to be listened to that way. From there ""Gray Area"" continues in much the same vein, with its clanging guitar motif ratcheting up the inhospitable atmosphere. It's like Oneida have locked you out of their world and are making it as difficult as they can for you to re-enter. This isn't music as escapism, it's music as challenge and provocation. Even the closing title track, which is all hushed-out generator hum and occasional murmurs of instrumentation, falls loosely into the same kind of disconcerting atmosphere as the incidental music to David Lynch's Eraserhead. Oneida are often talked about as a band that should have reached a wider audience, but they won't achieve that here, and they don't seem to care. They're a group whose music takes a great deal of time to sink in, where the process of evaluation slowly unravels over years and months rather than days and minutes. It's the reason why their album Each One Teach One, which is nine years old, is only now being fully unpacked and canonized as a major piece of work. Thank Your Parents will take an equivalent span of time to reveal its secrets, especially as this final part is likely to be met with a large degree of bafflement on first listen. But taken as a concluding piece of a larger body of work, as this is intended to be heard, it's a fiercely individual statement to end this chapter in Oneida's unique history.","Fiercely independent and with few avenues into its world, this minimalist record completes the psych-rock band's Thank Your Parents trilogy.

Cults,Cults,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2113d197565213a21c/1:1/w_160/b7adecf2.jpg,2011-06-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15432-cults/,In the Name Of,"When Cults' ""Go Outside"" first appeared on the web last year, it spread like wildfire. It was catchy and sweet, the kind of sing-along that felt like it was pulled from the air, with a sentiment perfect for anyone stuck in an office or addicted to the Internet. But how many communal sing-alongs can a band make before the approach goes stale? Cults have opted not to find out. ""Go Outside"" is on their debut album, and it still gives you your entire recommended daily allowance of vitamin D, but its dreamy drift is just one side of a band that proves it has the dexterity and songwriting chops to make a varied and memorable album. Much has been made about the speed with which Cults signed to Columbia, as if they're the first group to release a debut album on a major. That kind of rapid ascent isn't anything new, but the speculation that came with it-- online chatter pronouncing them destined for the one-hit-wonder bin-- now looks grossly off the mark. At the center of the band's appeal is singer Madeline Follin's youthful alto. She has a tone that creates the impression you're listening to a precocious tween fronting a band well versed in Phil Spector's Back to Mono and three decades of climactic indie pop. The 1960s girl-pop element of their sound is pretty evident on the surface-- ""You Know What I Mean"" even borrows its verse melody from the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go""-- but what they've done with it is pure 21st century, cutting it with synths, guitars, and softly integrated samples. The samples, of cult leaders speaking to their followers, could have been a distraction had they chosen to make a big deal out of them, but they're woven tightly into the album's sonic fabric and processed to varying degrees of decipherability, which turns them into an effective textural element. Those voices bounce around in the intro to ""Oh My God"", originally released last year as part of Adult Swim's singles program, but subtly remixed for the LP. The music hasn't changed here but the beat is amped up, and the bass has been moved forward in the mix, giving the song a much more powerful groove to support its melody. And if Follin's lyrics aren't necessarily deep-- ""I can run away and leave you anytime/ Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life""-- she delivers them with relatable and affecting conviction. This taps into a vein of petulance that runs through the album. ""I don't need anyone else,"" from ""Never Saw the Point"", may read as a tossed-off line, but in a strangely positive way, it feels like the record's main message. Even the eternally sunny ""Go Outside"" ends on the lyric, ""I think I want to live my life and you're just in my way."" These are teenage sentiments, the kind of things you feel dumb for saying and thinking once you've navigated into your mid-twenties, but they're also universal sentiments during that stage of life when you're trying to figure out what kind of person you're going to be. Cults' use of elements borrowed from traditionally teen music-- girl groups, 50s prom-pop, bedroom indie pop-- plays along with the lyrics to create a little world where one minute Follin is singing a frustrated ""fuck you"" (""Never Heal Myself"") and dreaming of escaping the next. Even the more formal pop explorations play to teen melodrama. The surging Spector pop of the record's anthemic opener ""Abducted"" compares falling in love to being kidnapped, and gives the other Cult, Brian Oblivion, a brief lead vocal to play the abductor. At just over a half hour, Cults feels like the perfect length-- just long enough for the bus ride to school (or to work). But more importantly, it executes what it sets out to do masterfully while allowing the group room to grow and mature. They've also set themselves up to take their sound and subject matter in any number of possible directions in the future, and that's a good position for a young band to find itself in.

Outbreeding,David Thomas Broughton,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af685e6ef95969321dc6/1:1/w_160/568192ee.jpg,2011-06-03 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15487-outbreeding/,Brainlove,"""He's from Otley near Leeds."" This is the text in the ""about me"" section of folksinger David Thomas Broughton's Facebook page, where he is listed as a ""local business."" Above it is a picture of Broughton looking very startled. The photo and the line make me laugh and, occasionally, so does Broughton's music, which mixes spare, matter-of-fact playing with a dry sense of humor and a self-effacing willingness to improvise. Take a line like, ""In the main all that I can glean is that this is the reason that this world is fucked,"" from Outbreeding's ""Electricity"". Prim syntax and barstool frustration collide in a rich baritone. Broughton pronounces ""fucked"" fooked, and the humor lies in the fact that he sings it as though it weren't funny. Thirty seconds later, the song devolves into unexpectedly dissonant keyboards and snippets of prerecorded talking. Outbreeding is the most band-oriented record he's released. (For comparison, he recorded 2005's The Complete Guide to Insufficiency alone in a church with the help of looping pedals.) He's said in interviews that he has a greater interest in trying new ideas than rehashing old ones, which is an attitude I admire in artists, especially when they can carry it off and sound curious instead of prickish. Broughton's voice is distinctive enough to anchor each track, but Outbreeding feels like it lacks a central character or thread. Some songs lean toward driving, structured folk-pop; some are lumbering and discordant. I like the comparatively poppy ones, but mostly because they showcase an intelligent juxtaposition of brisk, twinkly music with Broughton's natural melancholy. (I still love the chant-like atmosphere of The Complete Guide to Insufficiency, but the more downbeat tracks here don't have the same grace). Broughton's ideas are still worth hearing though, and his voice works for me (even though it might be feast-or-famine for other listeners). Like the folksinger Sam Amidon, his music sometimes feels indebted to a rustic, pre-Dylan past but is buoyed by a mischievous personality-- he takes something that sounds pat at first and turns it into something skewed and unusual. And like Amidon, Broughton's live shows are miniature spectacles: He roams through the crowd and uses furniture as percussion. He layers sounds in slightly haphazard ways, as though his songs weren't so holy that he couldn't subject them to chance. That kind of loose imagination and playfulness is not only hard to capture on record, it's probably impossible. The moment dissolves by nature, whereas recorded music wants to stick around forever. Broughton-- like Amidon-- will always be one of those artists probably better seen than heard, though somehow I imagine that doesn't bother him. Even on its less interesting tracks, there's something about Outbreeding that feels warm and content, like it was glad to be made.","The singer-songwriter with a rich baritone and a skewed sense of humor makes his most band-oriented record.

Blow Your Head Vol. 2: Dave Nada Presents Moombahton,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af785e6ef95969321de5/1:1/w_160/fc8015a7.jpg,2011-06-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15500-blow-your-head-vol-2-dave-nada-presents-moombahton/,Mad Decent,"Velocity is destiny: two ""new"" dance sub-genres getting attention in 2011 offer almost opposite perspectives on the effects of playing records at the wrong tempo. From Holland comes ""bubbling,"" a jittery, uptempo skitter with origins in the late 1980s, born from spinning dancehall records too fast. Meanwhile, in 2009 U.S. DJ Dave Nada slowed down Dutch house records to 108 beats per minute until the music (already part-Caribbeanized) uncannily resembled the throbbing pulse of reggaeton. Add cut-up Latin vocals, dem bow off-beats, crisp and seemingly endless drum rolls, and a bevy of obvious samples, and a new genre is born. ""Moombahton"" takes its name from the Afrojack remix of Silvio Ecomo and DJ Chuckie's ""Moombah"" (the ""-ton"" comes from reggaeton), but the idea is expressed most succinctly in Nada's remix of Sidney Samson's Afrojack-like anthem ""Riverside"". On the latter, the original's grating siren synth attack transmuted into a bleepy melody of unbearable tension. It's tempting to assume that transcending this simple gimmick would be necessary for moombahton to produce anything of lasting worth, but that's not the case. As Nada's new mix Blow Your Head Vol. 2 (for Diplo's Mad Decent label) proves, there's nothing wrong with a decent gimmick. In fact, moombahton works by treating everything as a gimmick. Just as big beat reduced both rap and rave to sample toolkits to be mined for maximum party hijinks, moombahton usually treats its Latin and Caribbean affectations as ruthlessly as it does house records. At times it's hard to say just who is spiking whom: As well as raw source material, the house components of moombahton paradoxically act as a stylistic destabilizer, like a returning comet throwing the music out of orbit. Take Sabo's remix of Dennis Ferrer's strobing vocal house anthem ""Hey Hey"", wherein the original's sharp counter-rhythm becomes a desultory strut around which Sabo weaves an exquisite rumpshaker groove. If anything, Blow Your Head Vol. 2, which gathers together a selection of tracks from moombahton's key producers, is at its weakest when the tunes veer too close to naturalizing their influences, and risk sounding too comfortable with themselves. Munchi's ""Sandungueo"" could easily be a malnourished, thuggish dub of an actual reggaeton record. Conversely, ""Gal Where Yuh Come From"" by Nadastrom (a duo of Nada and Matt Nordstrom) squeezes out just the right amount of estrangement from the music it mimics via an ominous rap from Jamaican DJ Natalie Storm, whip-crack snares, and a murky, dub-spacious arrangement. Nada pays respect to moombahton's roots by including cuts from ancestral reggaeton rapper El General and Shabba Ranks' ""Dem Bow"", but the best inclusions here work their magic by wearing these influences lightly and setting their sights more broadly. On tracks ""Masta Blasta"", ""Broken Hearts"", and ""Que Que"", Dillon Francis has developed a bevy of tricks-- stuttering electro kicks; woozy and disorienting synth lines-- that fuse European slither with Caribbean bounce. It would be meaningless, not to mention faintly ridiculous, to start talking about ""sophisticated"" or ""experimental"" moombahton, in part because the music is so rigorously party-focused. But there's also a stylistic restlessness that makes Blow Your Head Vol. 2 a more surprising listen than you might expect. The mix closes with Nadastrom's remix of Win Win's ""Rleleaserpm"", which could be a dancefloor renegade from the latest Gang Gang Dance album (in fairness, that is GGD's Lizzie Bougatsos on vocals). Crucially, this gorgeously sunny number never sounds impressed with its own unexpectedness: In the middle of moombahton's no-nonsense party vibes, pretty much anything is up for grabs.","On Diplo's Mad Decent label, DJ Dave Nada offers this overview of moombahton, a party-ready genre built from slowed-down samples of Dutch house records.

W,Planningtorock,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af769d034d5c69bf4706/1:1/w_160/b7dc489d.jpg,2011-06-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15498-w/,DFA,"It's easy to understand why Janine Rostron, the multimedia artist known as Planningtorock, has become a frequent collaborator of the Knife. In aesthetic terms, they're on a very similar wavelength. They both gravitate toward tense rhythms and a particular timbre in their keyboard parts that is at once totally menacing and vaguely cheesy. They both integrate elements of theater and performance art into their live shows. Most obviously, Rostron and Knife singer Karin Dreijer Andersson share a fascination with inhabiting male characters and exploring masculinity in their songs, to the point of pitching their voices down into a grotesque parody of manliness. Rostron does this trick on ""Doorway"", the opening track of her second full-length album, W, and the result is a song that could easily pass for an outtake from the Knife's Silent Shout. This is a compliment, to a point. Silent Shout is a remarkable album, so it's a flattering-- if somewhat superficial-- comparison. At the same time, that record is so singular and self-contained that there may not be need for anything else to sound like it, including future music by the Knife themselves. Rostron is a lot more interesting the further she gets from the sound of the Dreijer siblings. She established a distinct aesthetic on her debut, Have It All, and that style carries over to a large chunk of W. In these songs, she sings in a bold, sexually assertive style over riffs played on cello or keyboards. In one of her best recordings, a string arrangement of ""Think That Thought"" from the Have It All Stringed Up EP, she ends up sounding almost exactly like Robert Plant singing over a string quartet. She still recalls Plant here and there on W, but this time around, she's a bit closer to Annie Lennox, another female vocalist with a confident, soulful style and an androgynous tone. ""The Breaks"", W's atmospheric centerpiece, showcases this quality. Her voice is the most dynamic sound in the song, sketching out a complex mix of conflicting emotions while the rest of the arrangement settles into a sad, mellow keyboard-horn groove. It's a quietly compelling piece of music-- intensely passionate yet strangely subdued. She's even more impressive on the album highlight ""I Am Your Man"", a twitchy showstopper with an ironic, gender-bending perspective and an earnest, love-struck sentiment. In this song, masculinity is invoked more than it is critiqued. It's a celebration of being forthright and aggressive, of being bold enough to pursue someone with the firm belief that you're the right person for them. It's not that different from, say, Jeff Tweedy singing ""I'm the Man Who Loves You"", but Rostron's gender flip brings an intriguing tension to the mix. Is this the person she wants? Is this the person she wants to be? There are other fine songs on W-- the tense disco track ""Living It Out"", the sultry ""Manifesto""-- but as a whole, the record doesn't quite gel. The songs generally sound better out of context. This makes some sense. Though the pieces have a lot of musical similarities, each comes across as a discrete composition with its own set of ideas. In that way, W feels less like a pop album and more like a gallery show.","The Knife collaborator and multimedia artist establishes her own bold, sexually assertive identity on her DFA debut.

True Loves,Hooray For Earth,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aebb5e6ef95969321cc2/1:1/w_160/5d602d86.jpg,2011-06-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15340-true-loves/,Dovecote,"Hooray For Earth must've looked like party crashers when they opened for Surfer Blood and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart last year. Though they've staked out in different territories in terms of both production and influence, both headliners embody an ideal of what indie rock meant in the 1990s. Pains and Surfer Blood are heavy on the guitars, with songs written and recorded by four or five people in a room, each of whom has an easily identifiable job-- essentially a scrappier version of the ""alternative rock"" on the radio back in the day. Meanwhile, Hooray For Earth are what people are thinking of right now: songs composed on synthesizers that take cues from dance and psychedelia, fluidity between the roles of the players. But all in all, game recognized game, for on True Loves, Hooray For Earth also display a precocious knack for massive, major-key hooks that are ""indie rock"" in name only. As you could probably guess from the preceding description, advance singles ""True Loves"" and ""Sails"" placed the New York quartet in the packed house of bands often tagged with ""what we wished Congratulations sounded like."" It's unfair on both counts, robbing MGMT of some sort of agency in their artistic trajectory and limiting Hooray For Earth in terms of scope. With its candy-coated vocals and fluorescent production, True Loves siphons color from all points on the synth-pop spectrum. The spiky arpeggios of ""Realize It's Not the Sun"" and ""Sails"" pay homage to the Knife as well as Depeche Mode's arena-ready 90s, but each employs them for divergent purposes. And the title track offers upstroked, ska-rhythm guitars and Noel Heroux's dexterous falsetto run, along with dub-like painting around the edges with eerie, desiccated sound effects. Though sounding more like a singles collection than a coherent album-length vision, True Loves seems to unfold in a way that shows Hooray For Earth steadily accruing melodic confidence. While the six minutes of electro-tribal mantras on closer ""Black Trees"" recall earlier Yeasayer, the nervy palm-muted guitars and bold synth-horn charts of ""No Love"" and ""Bring Us Closer Together"" easily top Odd Blood's attempts at Trevor Horn-styled 80s chartbusters. But the sequencing isn't perfect: In between the killer bookends, serviceable mid-album palate cleansers ""Same"" and ""Hotel"" form a 10-minute stretch that roams a bit too far off course before the big reveals. The lull in momentum is more pronounced since the lyrics can be simultaneously too plainspoken and standoffish: As extroverted as these songs sound, you really never get a full sense of Hooray For Earth's personality. Still, it's no slight to say they've allowed themselves room for growth after True Loves, and there's little reason to believe their name won't be at the top of the marquee on the next go-round.","Taking cues from the synth-pop spectrum and adding some arena-ready hooks, Hooray for Earth slot nicely alongside the psych-pop of MGMT and Yeasayer.

Channel Pressure,Ford & Lopatin,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af795e6ef95969321dea/1:1/w_160/a4e326ca.jpg,2011-06-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15502-channel-pressure/,Software,"Ford & Lopatin is Joel Ford, a member of Brooklyn soft-rock fetishists Tigercity, and Daniel Lopatin, the guy behind synth-drone project Oneohtrix Point Never. Until late last year, they went by Games, but after legal snags (or, as Lopatin referred to it on Twitter, a ""shwagy situation""), they decided to keep it to their surnames. Some of the duo's earliest releases came in the form of a series of mixtapes: the double-cassette Spend the Night With Games and the three-volume set Heaven Can Wait. Those tapes pointed to some of the influences that would materialize in their own tracks, exploring chopped-and-screwed 80s slow jams, glistening funk tracks, and turn-of-the-90s new age club hits. They also straddled the line between sincere appreciation and goofball irony, a characteristic which carried over to Games' sugary synth-pop debut EP, That We Can Play. The duo's penchant for sly irreverence came out in their Pitchfork interview last year, too, when Ford cited as one of their visual influences ""anything that reminds us of our dads at work."" But despite these playful gestures, there's no messing around in what Ford & Lopatin do in the studio. While recording their debut album, Channel Pressure, F&L took their fondness for the sounds of the 1980s one step further and tracked the album at the studio of Jan Hammer, who composed the immortal ""Miami Vice"" theme. Accordingly, Channel Pressure is an impossibly slick and glossy record with sweet and sticky hooks that underscore the duo's talent for infusing pop songwriting with something beamed in from another era. The last time the pair experimented with vocals was on That We Can Play's ""Strawberry Skies"", which featured fellow retro-futurist Laurel Halo; while that song was a little dry and inert, Channel Pressure's most straightforward moments shudder and gleam with propulsive melody (the wide-stride disco of ""Joey Rogers"") and jittery, squelched arrangements (album highlights ""Too Much Midi (Please Forgive Me)"" and ""World of Regret""). The record's success owes a lot to its bold and clear vocals, handled by Ford and Jeff Gitelman of psychedelic soul revivalists the Stepkids. Their voices are often coated in electronic effects, but they move in and out of the music with a natural, brightly delivered pulse. The biggest surprise of all comes from avant-R&B weirdo Autre Ne Veut, who smooths out his wild delivery on the slow-burning ""I Surrender"". The album would be tiring if were nothing but a sincere homage to the cheesy pop of yesteryear, but F&L temper Channel Pressure with abstract vocal exercises and overcast instrumentals to keep the balance right. This careful structure might owe something to the album's extremely loose concept (something about a cyberpunk named Joey Rogers). Still, some of the instrumentals come over as merely functional-- not bad, but also not exactly tracks you return to out of context-- so even though there are song-focused highlights, Channel Pressure is ultimately to be taken whole. And part of the fun is in tuning into the collective ""ear"" of its makers, and hearing these beautifully rendered 80s sounds the way one suspects they hear them. So it's funny and referential and sometimes not completely engaging, but it also feels celebratory. As suggested by the electronics obsession of the album cover, the world of Channel Pressure is overstuffed and ridiculous, but also an enticing invitation to plug in and drop out.","The project from Joel Ford and Oneohtrix Point Never's Daniel Lopatin (formerly known as Games) shows a charming affection for the sounds of 1980s pop.

Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991),SpaceGhostPurrp,by: Brandon Soderberg,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af38c0084474cd0c1a2b/1:1/w_160/35d61977.jpg,2011-06-02 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15449-blvcklvnd-rvdix-666-1991/,self-released,"Though nobody's idea of the next big thing, Spaceghostpurrp, a 20-year-old from Miami who makes hypnagogic stripper anthems, received a strange co-sign from L.A. Weekly's blog: They called him ""Odd Future's Cosmic Cousin."" To be clear, Spaceghostpurrp will not make a game-changing appearance on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"", and outside of being another young skate kid fascinated by video games and Satan, he doesn't have much in common with Tyler and company. If a comparison must be drummed-up to sell this very weird, really good, but inarguably niche stuff, let's go with ""Clam Casino's evil druggie drop-out cousin from the South."" Like last year's NASA: The Mixtape, Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991) is obsessed with the earliest, ugliest Three 6 Mafia releases (particularly Underground, Vol. 1: 1991-1994) and follows that tradition of creepy club music while slyly updating it as well. ""Possessed"", Blvcklvnd's intro track, is lo-fi Lex Luger that tops the oppressive feeling of all those ""B.M.F.""-style beats, but toys with their pop appeal, thanks to a catchy, simple hook that is screamed like a black metal vocal. Further separating his style from anything resembling conventional hip-hop, Spaceghostpurrp doesn't care for proper mixing (you might go insane listening to this on headphones) and he piles on video game sound effects and dub reggae-like noises. ""Captain Planet"" is a contemplative bouncing moan, like some lost Oval track; hypnotic synth blasts turn the ridiculously titled ""Suck a Dick For 2011"" and hazy stripper anthem ""Grind on Me"" into something transcendent. By the way, there is lots of stuff like ""Suck a Dick For 2011"" on here, which means Spaceghostpurrp is also very into 90s rap's misogyny (lots of strip club talk and ""bitch"" shouts), so be warned. The last bunch of tracks climb out of the sizzurp murk and go for a 90s New York rap style. ""Legend of the East Pyramyds"" does moaning soul sample rap better than it has any right to, and then it piles on Halloween sound effects. ODB tribute ""Osiris of the East Pyramids Blackland R.I.P. ODB"" consists of synth tones floating ominously, merging the streetwise paranoia of New York and the verge-of-death doom of Houston. It's one of this year's most haunting songs even though it sounds like a mash-up of underground hip-hop from 15 years ago. Born in 1991, Spaceghostpurrp's really just another one of those indie bedroom producers approaching the music of his earliest years, pairing it with very of-the-moment sonic decisions, and exposing the ways that once disparate arenas of sound mesh together. Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991) is a mess of Three 6 Mafia-chanting, woozy Wu-Tang loops, DJ Screw wheeze, and Mortal Kombat and Godzilla sound effects, all paired with an off-the-dome rapping style that's equal parts Lil Wayne and Lil B. It's as if James Ferraro Lawnmower Man-ed his way into a rap rarity message board and soundtracked the journey.","This lo-fi opus from the young rapper/producer mixes Three 6 Mafia chanting, woozy Wu-Tang loops, DJ Screw wheeze, and Mortal Kombat sound effects.

Pre Serene: Thee Oneironauts,The Most Serene Republic,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5b13d197565213a27c/1:1/w_160/630d0399.jpg,2011-06-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15479-pre-serene-thee-oneironauts/,Home of the Rebels,"""The smartest thing a record label can do is sign a bunch of kids at 19, and then trick them into documenting their lives for the next six to 10 years."" So mused Ryan Lenssen, a founding member of the Most Serene Republic, upon the release of the band's most accomplished record, 2009's ...And The Ever Expanding Universe. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lenssen was 19 when the Most Serene Republic began releasing their take on baroque, kitchen-sink pop, in the process becoming the became the first non-Broken Social Scene-related project to sign to Arts & Crafts. Now they dig back into their vault to remaster and release eight tracks from Thee Oneironauts, a band that Lenssen and two other members of the Republic played in when they were 18. The resulting collection, Pre Serene: Thee Oneironauts, is as gawky as a middle school yearbook photo: It sounds like it was made by teenagers who play immoderate amounts of Zelda, like to write songs about 1980s movies that they think are really awesome, and do not yet feel the artistic need to disguise or complicate either of those artistic impulses. O sweet, guileless youth. Thee Oneironauts shows that even at an age when most would-be musicians are fiddling with distortion pedals and refining their teen angst, current Republic members Lenssen, Adrian Jewett, and Nick Greaves (along with non-Republic-an Emily Hunt) were always in the business of bleeding heart earnestness and ornate compositions. Unfortunately, Thee Oneironauts were unable to unite either of those things in intriguing ways, and this collection of their recordings comes off as skittish, cluttered, and excessively maudlin. ""Today Is the Day"" sounds like the work of a young band equally enamored with the Postal Service and the fact that synths can sometimes sound like rocket ships, while the tone and lyrics of the unreasonably long ""St. Germain"" aim for romantic but miss the mark. We now know that these guys would later develop into better songwriters, but this record doesn't offer much evidence in support. Still, Thee Oneironauts' most cringeworthy moment, ""Zoltar Speaks"" (yes, it's a song told from the point of view of Tom Hanks' character in Big) serves as a pithy thematic summary: This is a document of the anxieties of growing up. It's full of the sort of details and feelings that few of us sensible grown-ups would commit to tape (the lyrics to ""The Breath"" sound like facts that the band members memorized for their high school history class: ""1896: the first movie shown/ 1912: the Titanic went down""), and there's a certain charm to a document like that. But this one is something that only very loyal fans of the band will be able to appreciate; the rest will probably be left wondering why they took these recordings out of the vault in the first place.","Three members of the Most Serene Republic reach into the vaults to dust off their teenage, pre-Arts & Crafts recordings.

He previously explored advertently lush California sounds on 2006's Sun, Sun, Sun, but on his latest album, Bury Me in My Rings, Sennett has immersed himself in a definitively Golden State of mind. It's not what you think, however: Sennett riffs on Silver Lake ennui and Hollywood plasticity. To properly criticize it, you have to play an active role in it he seems to say. Indeed, the countrypolitan aspirations of Bury Me often make it sound hollow-- there's a basis in roots music, but it isn't ""rootsy"" by any stretch. Instead, the clean-shaven guitars, pedal steels, and violins (not fiddles) achieve an eerie minimalism. Even when they're all appearing at the same time, they're not overwhelming these songs or offering low-end counterpoint but playing toward Sennett's papery, Elliott Smith-like vocals. Meanwhile, Sennett's songwriting voice has a nonchalant, conversational tone. The melodies and lyrical sentiments of ""Born to Love You"" come so easily, you figure it just has to be cliché, until some loopy tangents about moon launches and flat-screen TV's suggest that Sennett's in on his own joke. On the whole, there are enough tossed-off thoughts and broken communication to make you feel like an eavesdropper rather than a part of a dialogue. Whether addressing a seemingly doomed relationship on the string-haunted ""Who Are You"" (""You got yourself a good girl/ That's good enough for you"") or possibly former Rilo Kiley drummer Jason Boesel during ""Have You Been Cheated"" (""Is your daddy a hustler?"" ostensibly referring to his solo album, Hustler's Son), there's a resigned lack of judgment, which always sounds empathetic even when it feels completely accusatory. That sense of resignation can also be a weakness. It wasn't the post-Postal Service production trickery that made Me First the best Rilo Kiley project since The Execution of All Things, but relatively uptempo numbers like ""Go On"" and ""A Time for Emily""-- there's an intriguing inversion in how Sennett's more aggressive music often sounds the most emotionally vulnerable. ""Go For the Throat"" approaches that sort of catharsis, but not much other than a distorted vocal effect on ""When I'm Gone"" will jolt you out of the second half of this record, which spends too much time with its feet up. Curiously, that sort of pointedly L.A. arrested development suits Sennett-- even as he morphs sonically, on Bury Me in My Rings he stays true to detailing a life of bright prospects and a willingness to underachieve.","Former Rilo Kiley member takes aim at the California lifestyle on his latest outing as the Elected.

Simple Math,Manchester Orchestra,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3cb1335d7bf1699eec/1:1/w_160/fabf182d.jpg,2011-05-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15453-simple-math/,ColumbiaFavorite Gentlemen,"As with many young songwriters prone to lyrically oversharing, Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull has often been paid the loaded compliment of being ""precocious."" It's a term that implies unfulfilled potential. But now that his latest album, Simple Math, aspires to be a culmination of his prior two bombastically titled and performed LPs, I can revisit them knowing they were fully conceived steps towards the logical endpoint, ""a story about a 23-year old who questions everything from marriage to love to religion to sex."" In other words, a concept album about the experience of being Andy Hull, written by Andy Hull. But hell, if there's any Conor Oberst acolyte capable of making The Merrimack to Titus Andronicus' The Monitor, it's Hull. As a frontman, he does his peers proud-- while his astringent, high lonesome warble immediately recalls the Jim James/Ben Bridwell dialect, it's flexible enough to handle both rebel yells and vulnerable self-flagellation. Hull's got a thing for drunken fuck-ups who own up to their failures, though he's far more interested in using it for autobiography rather than storytelling. His belief in his own profundity is kind of endearing as Manchester Orchestra's driving force. It's hard to imagine something like the title track, which uses infidelity as a jumping-off point to question the entire basis of human existence, even standing a chance without it. The problem lies in where Hull ends and Manchester Orchestra begins, and it's a space populated by lesser sons of the south, post-grunge good ol' boys like 3 Doors Down and Collective Soul-- tellingly, the most immediately hooky riffs of the lot (""April Fool"") lay mere inches down the fretboard from those of ""Shine"", and ""Leave It Alone"" flirts too briefly with a raw tenderness before diving headfirst into the sugary dross of truck-selling power ballad ""The World That I Know"". It's that ponderous alt-rock framework that makes Simple Math such a drag even as the lyrics and production feel like they're racing to out-sensationalize each other. While the burly guitars on ""Mighty"" and ""Pale Black Eye"" flex some swamp-rock muscle, as a full outfit, Manchester Orchestra simply plod instead of groove, bogged down by Simple Math's favorite artificial flavor, a charmlessly and coldly recorded string section. It's indicative of Simple Math's overcooking: Most of the time, the band can't find a moment of empty space it doesn't fill with that extra guitar overdub, more string cues, or another intimacy-sapping vocal harmony. Or you get something like ""Pensacola"", whose stein-swinging coda comes off like a fun idea they were dying to get in somewhere rather than an organic conclusion, to say nothing of its clear resemblance to a Modest Mouse song that happens to be called ""Florida"". And then there's ""Virgin"". It clearly announces itself as Simple Math's ""ambitious centerpiece"" by going all in on the epic signifiers: daunting strings, a horn section at the bridge, massed vocals, and, of course, a kiddie choir to drive the hook home. But melodically and tonally, they're simply piling onto what, at its core, is an incredibly simple arrangement-- its juddering, drop-D Alice in Chains riff is too repetitive not to be catchy, but taken as a whole, it's the most glaring example of a record that's too quick to cut corners and cheat its way toward unhinged transcendence despite so convincingly having its shit together. Which ultimately is where Simple Math falters despite its admirable ambition; as the saying goes, ""men plan, God laughs,"" and Simple Math is proof that your existential crises and epiphanies can't be micromanaged.","Conor Oberst acolyte continues to question everything from marriage to love to religion to sex but wraps much of it in a ponderous alt-rock framework.

Last,The Unthanks,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6513d197565213a28c/1:1/w_160/e5f051db.jpg,2011-05-27 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15485-last/,Rough Trade,"The Unthanks are an English folk group led by sisters Rachel and Becky Unthanks. That's their real family name. Though they were born, seven years apart, in the small, Northern English county of Tyne and Wear, they now call Northumberland home. They sing in a regional dialect and with regional accents, and they also organize residential ""singing weekends"" through their website, traditional holidays that include ""singarounds and workshops, short coastal walks, singing in the pub and food to write home about."" They're serious about singing. There is much cultural reference, mystery, and beauty to be found on Last, a lot of which can't be untangled by Google. The opening ""Gan to the Kye"" is a beautiful example, a piano-based standard about a plot, cattle, and a dead collie in the fields. Its titular refrain is a reference to an old plural word for ""cows."" Equally heart-breaking is ""The Gallowgate Lad"", a flowing, six-minute tale of a wayward militia man, sung from the perspective of a concerned lover. And then there's the seven-minute ""Close the Coalhouse Door"", a song whose slurry of fiddle and piano adds an ethereal sheet of light (""Close the coal house door, lad/ There's bones inside"") to the darkness of the industrial tragedy at its center. It's an unforgettable vocal performance, and while parts of Last can feel so rooted in tradition that it takes on a museum piece feel, ""Close the Coalhouse Door"" is theirs alone. Here they seem less about purism and more about their own impressions. When they dip into jazzier fare in ""Give Away Your Heart"" or offer a string-laced cover of Tom Waits' ""No One Knows I'm Gone"", Last verges on the staunchly traditional, but their singing takes the music somewhere else. And it has to, since both the instrumentation and the arrangements are stately and simple-- there's not much besides trumpet, piano, autoharp, fiddle, and strings. Rachel possesses a voice that's smooth and unfailing, while her younger sister Becky's has much more grain to it. The revolving harmonies of ""Canny Hobbie Elliot"" are emblematic of how well they can work together. Though it's one of the few songs on Last that isn't sad and bleak, their voices come together just so, and the result is mystifying and devastating.","Two sisters from the north of England put their own spin on tradtional British folk.

Arghiledes / Leaving the Commonwealth,D. Charles SpeerD. Charles Speer and the Helix,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2e5e6ef95969321d75/1:1/w_160/38980946.jpg,2011-05-27 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15444-arghiledes-leaving-the-commonwealth/,Thrill Jockey,"For D. Charles Speer, a veteran of New York's No-Neck Blues Band, there's not much difference between the honkytonks of the American South and the tekedes of early 20th century Greece. They may be geographically and culturally divergent, but both are centered around drugs-- alcohol and pot in honkytonks, hashish in tekedes-- and both are associated with very specific musical traditions. Speer explores these two worlds on his two new albums, revealing a common guiding principle: namely, a disdain for hard song structures in favor of inquisitive spontaneity. The primarily instrumental Arghiledes is a solo record in every sense: Speer played and overdubbed all the instruments, treated the sounds, and produced the record. He alternates between bouzouki and baglamas, then adds percussion, organ, and occasionally electric guitar to create spiraling drones. ""Tsamiko Hijaz"" features some spellbinding percussion, and in one of the more productive avenues, ""The Heavy Heart of Ando-Yeap"" melds those traditional Greek ideas with psychedelic-rock sounds. The album works best when Speer lets these musical ideas play out patiently, but it stumbles whenever he adds vocals. The guttural chanting on ""Harmanis"" is more cartoonish than narcotic, and at times Speer grunts and huffs-- presumably in English-- like Tom Waits, creating a commotion that distracts from graceful filigrees of acoustic guitar. Arghiledes sounds oddly aloof and self-indulgent, as though alienation were Speer's goal. If so, he achieves it too often. Leaving the Commonwealth is warmer in its appropriation of outlaw country, although it's a similarly academic endeavor. Speer buys into the whole redneck-hippie ethos that catapulted country music into the mainstream during the 1970s; Willie Nelson is to this record what bouzouki master Markos Vamvakaris is to Arghiledes. So many years later, however, it's just as impossible to recapture that sound and especially that sensibility as it is to evoke the smoky atmosphere of the tekedes, which makes Leaving the Commonwealth sound a bit too self-aware, even kitschy at times. When Speer begins talking his way through the end of ""Cumberland"" and describing a stock Southern eccentric character, he sounds more redneck-hipster than redneck-hippie. Although he hews a bit too closely to country's stock themes, Speer's songwriting can be surprisingly adventurous and spry, and his deep, granular voice is ideally suited to the honkytonk. And whenever Leaving the Commonwealth begins to lag, the Helix pick it up and keep it moving, like any good bar band should. Hans Chew's piano sounds like a gremlin in the works, constantly taunting the frontman, while Steven McGuirl's drums keep everything moving at a quick clip. The Helix proves as diverse as it is agile, moving from the straightforward honkytonk opener ""Razorbacked"" to the zydeco-inflected ""Le Grand Cochon"" to the more psychedelic moments on ""Freddie's Lapels"". The closing title track is a dense, sharp-cornered guitar jam that, much like ""Ando-Yeap"" on Arghiledes, takes the album in a completely new direction right before it ends. Both are intriguing, even exciting finales, which suggest that Speer is at his best when he's working not within specific historical frameworks, but between them.","No-Neck Blues Band member offers two new solo records, one focusing on the honkytonks of the American South and the other on the tekedes of Greece.

Super Mom,The Very Best,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af49b1335d7bf1699f02/1:1/w_160/f26db180.jpg,2011-05-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15464-super-mom/,self-released,"The Very Best's singer Esau Mwamwaya very rarely sings in English, so Westerners who make up most of his group's audience have to rely on feeling alone, and Mwamwaya's got plenty of that. It's probably a gross oversimplification to call Mwamwaya a happy singer, but there's a sense of pure liquid joy in almost every one of his vocal performances; you can practically hear his grin through the microphone, and that level of giddy enthusiasm is about as infectious as it gets. On the group's 2008 debut mixtape, Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit Are the Very Best, the European DJ duo Radioclit threw all sorts of pan-global dance and pop tracks at Mwamwaya, and he elevated nearly every one of them with that keening, high-pitched wail. You could do plenty of cultural-studies theorizing about all the levels of appropriation at work in that first mixtape-- white DJs snatching Vampire Weekend's quasi-African indie pop and refashioning it for an African singer. But actually listening to the final product, all that was beside the point. This wasn't a mental exercise; it was a joyously physical full-length, a gifted singer sliding across the pop landscape with a border-transcending glee. The Very Best followed that mixtape up with a triumphant debut album, 2009's Warm Heart of Africa, and now they're back with another free mixtape, one released to the Internet on Mother's Day after little more than a week of notice. But things within the group are different now. They've spent nearly three solid years on the road and in the studio, and now they're down to a duo; Radioclit has broken up, and one of those Euro DJs, Etienne Tron, is off to focus on other projects. It's tough to say what effect those new circumstances had on the group, but the new Super Mom is a markedly different piece of work from that first mixtape. The group's debut thrived in part on its sense of momentum; it let up only when it reached the suite of dizzily gorgeous ballads at the end. But even though Super Mom has more than its share of huge, swooping choruses and amped-up utilitarian dance beats, it's more of a trudge than its predecessor, and the tracks haven't been chosen with the same near-perfect sense of velocity and timing. Consider, for example, the group's version of Kanye West's ""Runaway"", which comes only five tracks into Super Mom. ""Runaway"" is a great song and all, but here it's a total momentum killer, more than six minutes of midtempo millionaire self-pity in the middle of what had been a dance party. Remaining producer Johan Hugo leaves the track almost untouched, letting Kanye and Pusha T deliver their verses in full and limiting Mwamwaya to intro and outro appearances and mid-verse ad-libs. It's a ballsy attempt at a hijacking, but Mwamwaya sounds awkwardly shoehorned into a song-- the sort of song that simply can't accommodate him. When Mwamwaya and Hugo are fully locked-in, there's still plenty of the sunburst happiness of that first album and EP, and putting Mwamwaya over a refashioned version of Tom Petty's ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" was an inspired choice. But more often than not, Hugo leaves giant chunks of the original songs intact, and nobody needs to hear Billy Idol's ""Eyes Without a Face"" when Mwamwaya only halfway gets to take it over. Another issue: An absolute horde of guest vocalists appears on the tape, few of them displaying anything like Mwamwaya's verve. It's a lot of fun to hear Mwamwaya alongside Senegalese legend Baaba Maal on ""Miracle"", but he barely gets a word in edgewise amid all the rappers, singers, and chanters on the jackhammer dance track ""Secousse"". Mwamwaya's voice is clearly the greatest thing the Very Best have going for them, and it's a bit weird to hear all these other people crowding him out. Of course, Super Mom is more of a quickie release than a fleshed-out artistic statement, and it's easy to imagine time constraints causing its relative thinness. The two entirely original tracks on the mixtape go a long way toward proving the duo still has gas left in its tank. The tape-opening title track shows everything anyone ever loved about the group in the first place, Mwamwaya airily belting over absurdly catchy, melodically fluid synth riffs. And the even more propulsive ""Ndekha"" builds up for two and a half minutes before the beat fully kicks in; when the hammer finally drops, it's glorious. Super Mom doesn't showcase the group at its best throughout. But as long as they're still capable of magic moments like these, they'll be impossible to write off.","Following the breakup of Radioclit, one half of the production duo, Johan Hugo, teams again with exuberant singer Esau Mwamwaya for a new mixtape.

Ideas For Songs,Destroyer,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6413d197565213a288/1:1/w_160/95accb2b.jpg,2011-05-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15484-ideas-for-songs/,Triple Crown,"Ideas For Songs came together in 1997, after Canadian label Granted Passage asked Dan Bejar to contribute a song or two for a cassette compilation; instead of sending just one, Bejar shot off 20-some home recordings, figuring they'd do the choosing for him. They didn't, and this release, originally on cassette and now re-mastered and re-issued digitally and on vinyl, was born. Largely comprised of little more than single-or-double tracked acoustic guitar and Bejar's vocals, the sound of Ideas For Songs isn't so much lo-fi as low-rent. The occasional adornment-- wheezy keyboards, a bit of lead guitar-- lends the set a certain amateurishness, but Bejar's vocals aren't shy in the mix, and there's a clarity to every sound, however shambolic their arrangement. Though there are fewer chords and leaps between sections than, say, Rubies, you can hear the shuffling grandiosity of some of Bejar's better-realized later compositions coming together here. Despite a few hints of Bejar's rickety indie-rock idols, his early music still feels somewhat unprecedented, due largely to his emergent vocal style. Even on these early recordings, his distinctive, sometimes divisive rasp carries much of its current impact, and, as on the spacious Kaputt, it's especially striking over this stripped-down setting. This meta-songcraft and wizened imagery, though still coming together on Ideas, feels much more akin to his later work than the same era's murkier, more experimental We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge. The set begins with a classic Bejar turnaround; over descending strums, he describes ""a boring nation at war with itself, but not really at war with itself"" and ""a giant among smaller giants."" His fondness for the disarming images and direct address is all over Ideas; there's the ""afterbirth too red to mention"" in ""Forget America"", and he closes ""Songs About a Girl Up to a Point"" with the bracing ""my dear, fuck you and fuck August."" Now as then, these sharply rendered left-field ruminations are the things Destroyer songs are made of, and Ideas is often withering, full of keenly observed, uniquely Bejarian takedowns. It has more than a few references that seem to find Bejar grappling with getting his lyrical ideas into the music; ""I couldn't find the words and then I found the words,"" he repeats throughout the unusually catchy ""Untitled"", and the grammar-policing ""Marrying the Hammer"" ends with a bit about the ""divorcing the chords to marry the hammer."" As inscrutable as Bejar's words can seem, it seems pretty clear that he's talking process here, about getting the two halves-- the ideas and the songs themselves-- to agree with one another. Matched up to Ideas' threadbare arrangements, his knotty lyrics untangle more easily. Ideas' best tune is probably its last, ""Why Banacek Doesn't Love"", which moves calmly and confidently back and forth between verse and chorus. Its refrain-- ""I'm seceding from a love I don't believe of""-- is his strongest to that point. But the key lines on ""Banacek"" come earlier, when Bejar sings of ""a string of broken entries"" and castigates someone for ""quoting and stealing and quoting"" and so on. Bejar naysayers often go after his overly allusive lyrics and his too-reverent genre dabbling, but here, while still carving out a musical identity of his own, he digs into himself, operating almost outside of influence, laying much of the groundwork for what would become his inimitable style. Ideas For Songs may be a glorified demo, but rarely do early sketches feel this well-rendered, and however unintended its release as a full-length, this is a vital document in Destroyer's development. Next to later compositional triumphs like Streethawk: A Seduction or Kaputt, the musical side of these Ideas For Songs may leave a little to be desired. But Destroyer has long been about getting as many smart, startling lines into the music as possible, and all that starts here.","Initially issued on a limited cassette, this odd and varied collection of early home recordings by Dan Bejar has been given a vinyl/digital reissue.

Brave Irene EP,Brave Irene,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1b9d034d5c69bf466c/1:1/w_160/bf7459be.jpg,2011-05-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15426-brave-irene-ep/,Slumberland,"Brave Irene's debut EP represents a return for bandleader and indie pop veteran Rose Melberg. It's the first time in 15 years that one of her projects has seen release on Slumberland (the Bay Area indie previously put out a self-titled 10"" from her collaboration with All Girl Summer Fun Band's Jen Sbragia as the Softies.) It's also the first time she's fronted a band making this kind of racket since her days as a member of the early 1990s noise-pop outfit Tiger Trap. So for anyone who has been following along with her more low-key work in the interim, the rocky blast that kicks off Brave Irene opener ""No Fun"" is both a surprise and a welcome look back at the past. That's not to say she's repeating herself here. Melberg has always been a shapeshifter. While Tiger Trap had a hand in drawing the clattering blueprint for a sound that's still beloved and imitated, the Vancouver-based Brave Irene draws inspiration from a different world of underground rock-- specifically, the rolling ""Dunedin Sound"" that came from esteemed New Zealand label Flying Nun in the 1980s and 90s. The Kiwi callback comes mostly in the form of Caitlin Gilroy and Jessica Wilkin's dual keyboard assault; their seasick lines dart in and out of the eight songs here, providing a see-sawing motion to even the EP's least ""rocking"" song, the sweet ""Bank Holiday"". Coupled with the rapidly precise drumming of Laura Hatfield, Brave Irene's keyboard-heavy sound carries with it a hint of psychedelia. There's nothing distinctly ""trippy"" about Brave Irene as a whole, though; these songs contain the same questions of the heart that fans of Melberg's output expect from her projects. She delivers those musings in her bright, empathetic voice-- the same one that made the Softies' dreamy, drumless songs so instantly inviting. Not a word is wasted, from the long-distance heartbreak of ""River to the Sea"" to the fearless flight of ""Hit the Grass Running"", pronounced with an arresting intimacy that feels refreshingly out of step with current indie trends. After all, this is ""feelings"" music, and if you can't parse the sentiments, how do you relate? That directness is what places Brave Irene in the here and now. Obviously, the ""Slumberland sound"" has been warmed over plenty of times by younger artists with impeccable record collections and keen ears for replication. But little of the recent revivalism has sounded this fresh and bright-- ironic, given how long Melberg has been at it. There's plenty to like here, whether you've been approaching indie pop through its new disciples or you're the kind of person wondering if Cub will ever make another record. For a band with such strong ties to the past, Brave Irene's future sounds especially appealing.","Indie pop veteran Rose Melberg returns with a new band and a new sound that touches on the thick sonics of the Flying Nun stable.

Not every record they make is a masterpiece, but they always deliver diligent, worthwhile music. The same is true of Sightings, whose latest LP happens to be released on Our Mouth, the label run by Mouthus' Brian Sullivan. The two bands have lots of similarities-- each takes a workman-like approach to its music, each has a patience that makes even its wildest moments sound thoughtful, and each relies on a uniquely dissonant guitar sound and hybrid acoustic/electronic drumming. Most importantly, both like to carve structures out of their noise. Their brittle feedback and clanging rhythms can be harsh, but even their most abstract stuff is carefully shaped. On recent Sightings albums, those shapes have become more prominent. 2007's Through the Panama even had some hummable tunes, and 2010's City of Straw continued that momentum. On Future Accidents, Sightings are less concerned with short, sharp nuggets. There is one track-- the churning, hardcore-tinted ""The Knotted House""-- that pours its energy into a five-minute burst. But the remainder of the album is more expansive. Its sounds as if some particular ideas were itching at Sightings, and they decided to scratch away until music bled out. That may sound brutal, but this is actually their mellowest effort to date. Other Sightings records, particularly 2004's Arrived in Gold, are sparser and more restrained, but Future Accidents has the smoothest surface. Mark Morgan's trademark guitar sound, a singularly metallic scrape, is a bit more distant here. Think of it and his snarling voice as the supporting cast to the starring rhythmic loops of bassist Richard Hoffman and drummer Jon Lockie. It may be a stretch to call this Sightings' Krautrock album, but there are some grooves here, and the band rides them as if hypnotized. At least, there's something Faust-like about the final track, ""Public Remains"", which at 19 minutes takes up about half of Future Accidents. However it came together, it sounds chopped up and rearranged, echoing some of the rattling, broken-machine collages on The Faust Tapes. It's one of the most abstract things the band has ever done-- even their early attacks had songs buried at the bottom, while this piece is more like audio sculpture. But it's also detailed and organized, again bearing a methodical approach that, for this group, has become second nature. Which makes the album title kind of funny-- with Sightings, it's hard to imagine anything being an accident, now or in the future.","New York noise trio offers its mellowest album yet, filled with Krautrock-inspired grooves and a 19-minute abstract audio sculpture.

People Changes,Nat Baldwin,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5eb1335d7bf1699f25/1:1/w_160/17e26e34.jpg,2011-05-26 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15481-people-changes/,Western Vinyl,"Nat Baldwin has an impressive résumé. He's studied under free jazz guru Anthony Braxton, contributed to Department of Eagles' In Ear Park as well as Vampire Weekend's Contra, and has been the bassist in Dirty Projectors. Over the course of nine years, he's also recorded several solo full-lengths (not to mention a split collaboration with Extra Life) that are equally varied. People Changes, his fifth, is a rich addition. The recording writing process this time out took Baldwin to a remote cabin in Maine. That sort of setting may sound familiar, and, like Bon Iver's debut splash, this is a record with a wonderful ambiance. Unlike most of 2008's Most Valuable Player, People Changes finds Baldwin largely on his own: just his voice and bass, with help from a few friends. Baldwin sings in a lovely melisma, the same slippery style used by his Dirty Projectors bandmate Dave Longstreth. But while Longstreth's voice will often crunch itself up into grotesque shapes, Baldwin keeps his airborne. It serves as a terrific juxtaposition to the spare arrangements of People Changes. The earthen tones of his double-bass act as both anchor and trampoline for Baldwin's voice, an instrument that flutters and swoops as it pleases. On opener ""A Little Lost"", an Arthur Russell cover originally played by its composer on cello, they both begin high. Baldwin is often one to scratch his strings for dissonance, but here, he opts for softer textures-- a sort of bedding. This fits both the song's gentle lyrical gait as well as Baldwin's singing. Where Russell's original worked within a traditional pop template, utilizing choruses and verses, Baldwin's tends to embellish around those borders. It gives everything a wide-open feeling, just as it does it does in closer ""Let My Spirit Rise"". On paper, lines like ""Kiss me once for yourself"" might seem like material more suited for navelgazing singer-songwriters. But despite what the arrangement or lack of structure might suggest, this is every bit the pop song. Its fantastic array of textures sets it apart all the more. Those only grow more interesting as People Changes unfolds. While woodwinds burble in the high-wire drama of ""Weights"", Baldwin injects blasts of guitar, sax, and snare to the quiet of ""Lifted"". The brief ""What Is There"" is an instrumental exploration of his bass in which he conjures elemental groans and belches. And whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a thrilling feeling of freedom to it all.","The busy bassist from Dirty Projectors returns with another strong solo album that focuses mostly on double-bass and voice.

"MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af60b1335d7bf1699f2c/1:1/w_160/90822052.jpg,2011-05-26 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/,Maybach,"Wale's short career has taken some weird and fascinating turns. When the D.C. rapper first came on the scene, he was a hero to a certain kind of fan-- a conscious rapper who talked about sneakers just as easily as he talked about struggles, and one who seemed comfortable rapping over different styles but who remained tied to his city's grassroots go-go scene. 2008's The Mixtape About Nothing took its ""Seinfeld"" theme as an unlikely jumping-off point and ended up on plenty of year-end best-of lists. But then Wale's hyped-up official debut album, 2009's Attention Deficit, was a stylistic jumble that bricked hard commercially and didn't make good on his promise with critics, and his last few mixtapes have lacked a clear direction. Last year, Wale randomly turned up on ""No Hands"", a strip-club track from crunk revivalist Waka Flocka Flame; when Wale put the song on his mixtape More About Nothing, he called it ""The Guilty Pleasure"". But ""No Hands"" became a massive rap-radio hit and probably saved Wale's career. In guest appearances since then, he's been remaking himself as a snarly pimp, a role that actually fits him pretty well. And then, in a truly unlikely move, surging drug-rap superstar Rick Ross signed Wale to his Maybach Music imprint. Rick Ross had a triumphant 2010. He scored the hit of the summer with the blaring gangsta anthem ""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)""-- this despite the fact that everyone now knows that he spent time pre-rap as a prison guard and that all his tales of kingpin life are straight theatrical bullshit. He's also greatly improved as a rapper since his inauspicious beginnings, concentrating on his strengths and finding a decadent edge for his grunt-heavy, larger-than-life delivery. His Teflon Don was one of rap's best albums of 2010. And after the year he just had, he must feel like he can do anything; that's one way, anyway, to explain the roster he's assembled at Maybach Music. Right now, the label features mostly promising young critic favorites who haven't shown the kind of charisma it takes to be an actual star; Wale is just the beginning. There's also Meek Mill, a young and squeaky-voiced Philly rapper who carries the torch for ex-State Property guys like Peedi Crakk. There's Pill, a raspy fast-rapping Atlanta mixtape guy. There's Teedra Moses, a long-underrated R&B singer-songwriter who hasn't been anywhere near the pop marketplace since she released her strong 2004 album Complex Simplicity. All these artists have their strengths, and all of them work best in very specific contexts. But on the group album Self Made, Vol. 1, Ross pulls all of them away from their respective comfort zones and tosses them headfirst into the stormy, orchestral arena-rap that he himself favors. The end result is predictable: they all sound lost. Wale, Meek, and Pill are all gifted technical rappers, but technical rappers can disappear when they show up on something like Just Blaze's stormy, cluttered title track. Even though all three MCs have distinct voices, accents, and deliveries, they blur into one multisyllabic mush on songs like these-- dancing around the edges of these tracks rather than bulldozing through them the way Ross does. (Moses, meanwhile, is generally limited to cooing wordlessly in the background; she's sadly a non-factor here.) Of the three rappers, Meek has the best moments; tough-talking hard on the street single ""Tupac Back"" (though his Pac impression could use some work). Pill shows no signs of any discernible personality here, but his growl of a voice makes him a decent-enough supporting player on a few of these tracks. But Wale just sounds utterly confused, kvetching about his past industry troubles and vowing that he's going to keep his integrity intact even though he sounds more interested in talking about clothes and girls than in displaying any of that vaunted integrity. At this point, he seems to have no idea who he is. Ross mostly takes a backseat on the album, but his brief appearances, usually limited to hooks, show why he's in a different universe from his  charges. A song like ""Pacman"" is clearly intended as a Pill showcase, but Ross is tough and loose and funny (""All my power pellets, turn you bitch niggas to ghosts!"") while Pill is serious and clenched and anonymous. When non-Maybach Music guests stop through, the problem gets even worse. Jadakiss absolutely schools Wale on ""600 Benz"", while J. Cole-- a rapper with an Internet-friendly mixtape pedigree just like the younger Maybach Music guys-- still whups everyone's ass on ""Fitted Cap"". Longtime Ross associate Gunplay only gets one appearance, which is too bad; he conveys more verve and passion in his one verse than his new labelmates manage in all their showcases. If Wale, Meek, and Pill could find a way to focus on their own strengths, maybe they'd sound more comfortable alongside their new boss. Instead, they all sound like they're trying to become mini-Rosses, and it doesn't work for them. Self Made, Vol. 1 is designed to demonstrate that Ross' new proteges can succeed in rap's major leagues, but it proves the opposite.","On a major roll these last couple of years, Rick Ross here assembles an introduction to his label, which includes Wale and Meek Mill.

He also billed himself as Jay Reatard, the pseudonym he would use on a staggering number of recordings until his death early last year. According to a transcript included with this deluxe reissue of Teenage Hate, Reatard was a name taken on one night not long before the material was recorded, during a live set comprised of Bay City Rollers covers. ""After our first song some guy with a big green mohawk yelled out 'you guys are fucking reatarded [sic],'"" he said. ""So at the next garage party we played, I announced us as the Reatards kinda as a joke but the name fit so we kept it."" The name Reatard was both a self-deprecating goof and an homage to Ramones and Oblivians, the latter being the Memphis-born garage-punk crew that served as his friends and mentors. Eric Oblivian's (née Friedl) Goner Records shop acted as Reatard's library, just as the Goner imprint is responsible for Reatard's first releases, including this one. Greg Oblivian (née Cartwright, currently of Reigning Sound) sat in on drums for Fuck Elvis, an added bonus collection of mostly solo four-track recordings originally released on cassette. As a first step, both Teenage Hate and Fuck Elvis Here's the Reatards are astonishing. All the energy one could hear in Reatard's better-known work is here in it's rawest, most volatile form. It's the same electricity he was able to funnel into his synth-punk adventures in Lost Sounds and later harness for 2006's Blood Visions, not to mention his more polished work for Matador just before his death early last year. ""Guitar, screaming, and pounding"" was an accurate credit. We know that Reatard was prolific. But it's made especially clear here how whole-heartedly and violently he hurled himself into music from the beginning. Teenage Hate in particular has a hot, fantastically gritty quality to it. It's a rough and rude sprint through Southern-inflected, punk-driven garage rock. Reatards were a three-piece that included Steve Albundy Reatard (""Guitar, Occasional Yells"") and Elvis Wong Reatard (""The Skins, Hollering, and Pickin'""), but it's quickly clear that Jay's presence is what sets them apart. You can hear it in the three-chord thwack of ultra-bleak opener ""I'm So Gone"" or the cyclonic sneer of ""I Love Living"", and it only intensifies from there. ""It Ain't Me"" is a two-minute runaway train. The chorus of ""Quite All Right"" lands like a warhead, as does the choir of howled ""motherfuckers"" on ""Down in Flames"". While the lyrical themes are standard punk fare (he's bored, horny, angry, and lonely; he hates Memphis as much as he loves it), the screaming, red-faced delivery makes them feel personal and true. On ""When I Get Mad"", we get a look at the Jay Reatard who had a reputation for throwing punches. ""When I get mad, I don't think/ Said, I don't give a shit about anything."" Reatard talked a bit in interviews about growing up in Memphis, where Elvis' legacy was inescapable. And though he takes on a few of Elvis' vocal tics here, it's a young Kurt Cobain who comes through most, particularly in the bloody coughing of ""Memphis Blues"". He screams so hopelessly that you'd swear he'd conk himself out from exhaustion. Through 18 tracks just as unfiltered, he never quits. And though its recording quality renders it flat in comparison, Fuck Elvis is a welcome addition as far as bonus reissue material goes. Many of its songs can be found on Teenage Hate with added muscle and clarity, so it plays more like a cache of early demos. The aforementioned ""Memphis Blues"" makes a blurry appearance, Reatard introducing it with a very appropriate, ""Are you ready to rock'n'roll? Well, here I go..."" There's a lot to dig into in the bonus material, much of it still coming into focus but all of it stamped Reatard's own. Alongside covers of Fear and Buddy Holly, Reatard offers herculean takes on Lil Bunnies' ""Carrot Belly Bunny Blues"" and early Beatles' B-Side ""I'm Down"", a live recording tacked on to close the set. It's insanely sloppy and dissonant, Reatard's screams barely audible over cymbal crash and sludgy guitar, all the way to the finish. ""We're the Reatards,"" he says. ""Thanks."" People shout for encores.","This CD/vinyl reissue of the astonishingly intense LP from Jay Reatard's early band adds the cassette-only Fuck Elvis Here's the Reatards as a bonus.

Blue Suicide,Coma Cinema,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af41ea9e61561daa6409/1:1/w_160/a642dec9.jpg,2011-05-25 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15458-blue-suicide/,Wonder Beard TapesFork and Spoon,"It's not hard to draw a line between the music on Coma Cinema's third proper release, Blue Suicide, and the pains it took to make it. Mat Cothran, the sole member of the South Carolina downer pop project, spent time in between sessions carrying microphones around, looking for the opportunity to record on equipment he stumbled upon. Lacking funds and created against the backdrop of the belly-up mill town he grew up in, Blue Suicide is expectedly blue. Perhaps not as expected is how ambitious and arresting this album can be, taking its emotional cues from the lovesick and bored American Gothic landscapes it was conceived in, and its musical touchstones from just about anywhere Cothran's determination allowed. There's a moment on ""Greater Vultures"" that helps put this process-- and the end result-- into perspective. Instead of amping up the poignancy on this dirge-like wallow by employing a weepy string part, Cothran brings in a sort of monster-movie synth line that's both oddly placed and a little disquieting. It's possibly a move made out of necessity, but it's these limitations and what Cothran does with them where the magnetism lies. When he creatively skirts these hindrances, it's often what keeps you on the hook. In the case of ""Greater Vultures"", it allows the song to take on a much deeper desperation. As Cothran murmurs, ""Are you willing to eat what the vultures will not?"" it's pretty clear that this acceptance of a less than perfect situation is a valuable part of Cothran's approach, as well as Blue Suicide's appeal. Which isn't to say it doesn't succumb to mere convenience at times. There are plenty of songs that seem comfortable just floating by in ways that clash with Cothran's larger ambitions. But there's always something to hold onto, no matter how shaky the foundation may be. Cothran-- by no means a flexible singer-- often alternates between a buzzing lilt and a dolorous hush throughout the album, but he has an ear for melodic hooks, often testing his limits with surprising results. ""Lindsey"" sounds like a Siamese Dream-era Smashing Pumpkins demo, with Cothran miming Billy Corgan at a dramatic extreme. ""Caroline, Please Kill Me"" is equally pleasing, boisterous and whiny with a radio-friendly enthusiasm. The fact that these bigger songs sound so homemade (though well-mixed and recorded) may prove detrimental to some, but it's hard not to admire a guy who has the gall to flatly ignore his relative inexperience in favor of just going for it. There are moments that come close to real greatness. ""Her Sinking Sun"" is a devastating hymn that can barely scrape itself off the ground to greet you, but Cothran isn't the kind of songwriter who gets off on sulking. ""Sinking Sun"" harnesses the gloom in such a visceral way, it has the strength to puncture. ""Eva Angelina"" is even better, mostly because it's the most self-assured offering here-- a patient, slow-blooming heartbreaker that gets under your skin. More importantly, it's proof that there are truly impressive songs in Cothran. With some luck, enough people will get their hands on Blue Suicide to give him the chance to really prove us right.","Mat Cothran's one-man downer project creates an ambitious and arresting American Gothic album despite financial limitations.

Fever,2562,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3a13d197565213a24c/1:1/w_160/a54c1102.jpg,2011-05-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15451-fever/,When In Doubt,"For better and worse, electronic music cares about process. You wouldn't ever congratulate a friend who spent months getting his oven to function as a refrigerator, but anyone who can make a vacuum sound like an 808 can prepare for notoriety, if not outright praise. Artists such as Matthew Herbert, the Field, and Matmos have diced sounds until their notable sources are barely detectable. So it goes with 2562, whose third album, Fever, was inspired by disco music (hence the title) released in the late 1970s around the time of the producer's birth. It's probably a smart gambit for the producer: His first two albums, while well received, were more notable for expanding dubstep's geographical imprint (2562 is the postal code of the producer's home in the Hague) than its sonic one. Despite its roots-- every last sound here is sampled from disco records-- Fever is a fairly catholic dubstep set: Racketeering snares, ominous chord structures, and a vague melodic distension pervade the album. Still, you can hear the fruits of his labor, especially in comparison to 2009's Unbalance. Fever is warmer, due both to its subtle vinyl crackle and the vague symphonic timbre that hovers whenever its minute samples are massed in melody. The persistent, four-on-the-floor clacking that propels ""Brasil Deadwalker"" is a visceral reminder of how techno and house borrowed and digitized disco's rhythmic structure. The anthemic opener ""Winamp Melodrama"" (great title) grabs a Gamble & Huff hammer and bangs everything in sight. 2562 doesn't employ vocal samples very often, but on the album-closing title track he gathers several into a dense fog and achieves a kind of beauty rarely attempted elsewhere on the album. About that: Fever, like 2562's previous records, is hard music. There is no wobble in the bass or flutter in the melodies; they are presented as-is, with little space for the listener. Fever can sound plastic, unpliable at times. I can hear the echoes of those old disco records in these sounds, but I can't find any of the laughter, silliness, or goodwill that fueled them. 2562 spent a lot of time molding one genre of music into another: It's safe to say he cares about sound for sound's sake. Which is fine, but it also means that the process that drove Fever's creation wasn't undertaken in an effort to illuminate the source material (it should be said that while most genres of dance music owe a healthy debt to disco, dubstep is really more of a third cousin than a granddaughter) or forge new territory. It was done as an exercise. So parts of Fever-- the bone-on-bone thwacks that close ""Flavour Park Jam"", for instance-- are essentially just 2562 going through the motions: the tedious, musically rigorous motions. I adore the idea behind Fever, and the attempt to artistically bind oneself to a process like this is brave. But in boxing himself in, 2562 seems to have found just a new box, a constricted area where several of his compositions suffocate. Those that escape are enjoyable as some kind of tonally curious, hardscrabble bass music, which is where 2562 began in the first place.","Dutch post-dubstep producer finds inspiration in his parents' old disco vinyl as source material for his new recording.

Black Earth,Implodes,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4aea9e61561daa641b/1:1/w_160/5c3d9e6a.jpg,2011-05-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15465-black-earth/,Kranky,"There's a fascinating dichotomy inside of Black Earth, the first official album from Chicago quartet Implodes. Stylistically, it's almost schizophrenic-- tracks alternate between shoegaze, Krautrock, post-rock, experimental drone, and acoustic ambiance, and those modes don't often meet together in one place. Yet the overall mood is forcefully consistent, with a weight approaching gravitational pull. That tone is captured somewhat in the cover art's stark silhouettes, but even that image is a little too colorful for this hazy, shadow-filled sound-cloud. Whenever I listen, I picture the music emanating from a mesmerizing field of TV static, roughly like what the little girl stared into in Poltergeist's iconic image. That may seem a bit overdramatic, but Implodes sound like they take their music pretty seriously, and they should. It's carefully crafted and wholly enveloping, a kind of dream-state atmosphere where vocals shiver behind layers of fuzz, rhythms detonate like underwater explosions, and acoustic guitars drift in and out like flashes of déjà vu. Some tracks on their own might sound a bit derivative-- ""Marker""'s floating noise has a Slowdive tint, ""Screech Owl"" bears the spooky lurch of early Sonic Youth, and the slow melodrama of Mogwai slips into ""Song for Fucking Damon II (Trap Door)"". Others pass through corridors of the Kranky catalog, skirting spaces between Labradford, Bowery Electric, and Jessamine. But when fused together by Implodes' assured sense of narrative thrust, these songs are much more echoes than mimicry-- like an unfamiliar, moonlit landscape dotted with fleeting glimpses of past ghosts. All of which makes for a pretty heavy listen. Dense, dark, and slow even when it's fast, Black Earth can get murky and claustrophobic, sucking in the air around it. There's a fine line between mesmerizing and depressing, and while I find myself squarely on the entranced side throughout, I can see where others might find the dimmer passageways more blinding than beckoning. But this is where the band's stylistic diversity helps. While a deep drone like ""Oxblood"" may burrow the center of the earth, it's immediately countered by the motoring sway of ""Meadowlands"", or the hymn-like buzz of ""Wendy"", or the lilting blur of ""Experiential Report"". Which is why the most interesting thing about Black Earth is what it bodes for Implodes' future. If they can already mold this many sounds into the same tonal shape, imagine what further sonic territory they might someday place their stamp on.","Chicago quartet crafts a murky and claustrophobic record with debts to Mogwai and early Sonic Youth but a narrative thrust all its own.

Pala,Friendly Fires,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af459d034d5c69bf46b9/1:1/w_160/2cdd4767.jpg,2011-05-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15463-pala/,XL,"There's a song on Friendly Fires' eponymous 2008 debut that's called ""Jump in the Pool"". The lyrical concerns are pretty straightforward (hint: jumping and pools are involved), but what makes it one of the LP's standouts is how its chorus takes the titular advice and just goes for it, changing from peppy polyrhythms to fast, charging lushness in a matter of seconds. It's a melodic shift that's as over-the-top as it is impressively delivered-- but that's kind of the point. Friendly Fires was best when playing to the rafters with romantic electro-gaze textures (""Skeleton Boy"") and big, cheesy gestures (""Paris""). They're sensualists who excel under a lack of restraint. Wisely, the band's sophomore effort, Pala, wastes no time submerging itself into its own indulgent environment. The multi-layered neon pop of album opener ""Live Those Days Tonight"" only hints at the LP's sonic ambition, as the band's immense co-production with buzz-bin consigliere Paul Epworth lends extra depth to its colorful sonic detail. There's been three years between Friendly Fires and this thing, and they've clearly spent it well by jewelling every last detail with careful precision (the B-movie blast that spools off ""Blue Cassette""'s final reel, ""Helpless""' backseat chatter and Boards of Canada keyboards). To an extent, Pala also clears these guys' name on the ""rockist dance-dilettante"" list. From the galloping UK funky rhythm in ""Chimes"" to the filtered, bleeping funk of ""Hurting"", there's an array of styles tried on and, for the most part, successfully worn. Those successes speak as much to the band's listening habits as they do to a sense of maximalist adventurousness. However, all the signifiers in the world don't change the fact that Friendly Fires are a rock band first-- and a particularly emotive one, at that. The band's three members got their start as teenagers in the never-known vocal-less ""post-hardcore"" (read: emo) outfit First Day Back. Anyone who's ever had a taste for that stuff knows that once it enters your blood, it tends to stay there, and Pala's high-stakes framework reflects that. Hearts are set on fire regularly (no, not like that), while impassioned pleas ""Show Me Lights"" and ""Pull Me Back to Earth"" are exactly as sweeping as you'd expect. It's when the band gets too entrenched in maudlin, dark-hued dramatizing (the too-slow-burn of the title track, ""Chimes""' bald-faced falsetto foolery) that Pala's deep-sea diving feels similar to drowning. Not to worry, though-- they have a sense of humor too, as ""Hawaiian Air"" proves. As the title suggests, frontman Ed Macfarlane's lyrical concerns focus on a trip to, you guessed it, Hawaii-- only, he spends the entire song detailing his escapades on the flight there (""watching a film with a talking dog,"" ""skipping the meal for a G&T""), barely able to breathe in that tropical oxygen. It's a simple-pleasures zoom-in that belies the album's candy-painted sweep, a sneaky yet sentimental grin amidst all the pleading and sincerity-- 'cause this stuff is supposed to be fun, right?","UK band continues to make high-stakes music that excels best when acknowledging its dance-rock present rather than its emotive past.

Let Love In / Murder Ballads / The Boatman's Call / No More Shall We Part,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af545e6ef95969321da4/1:1/w_160/68609ea3.jpg,2011-05-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15476-let-love-in-murder-ballads-the-boatmans-call-no-more-shall-we-part/,Mute,"The 1990s were very good to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Where the previous decade saw Cave successfully transition out of the Birthday Party's combustible punk toward a more urbane, theatrical brand of rock, the 90s elevated him to the realm of archetype and institution. He successfully party-crashed Hollywood and ""Top of the Pops"", all while the college-radio charts filled up with emergent artists-- PJ Harvey, Tindersticks, Afghan Whigs-- cut from the Bad Seeds' black-velvet cloth. The Bad Seeds' mid-90s pinnacle forms the basis of the latest round of Mute's excellent reissue series, which include vividly remastered versions of the original albums, along with a 5.1 surround sound mix, B-sides, official videos, and the latest installments of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's illuminating fan-testimonial documentaries, Do You Love Me Like I Love You? The title of the film series is taken from the two-part song that opens and closes Let Love In, an authoritative show of force that was perfectly timed for the Bad Seeds' insurrectionary appearance on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour. The Bad Seeds had always traded in high drama and dissonance, but never before had they sounded this imposingly heavy-- the lecherous intimations of ""Do You Love Me?"" explode into a torrent of chain-gang vocals and drummer Thomas Wydler's machine-gunned snare rolls, while ""Loverman"" triggers its quiet-to-loud eruptions so masterfully, Metallica would later cover the song to the surprise of no one. But amid Let Love In's ballast, you can hear Cave's increased adeptness at exploring his fascinations using sly, pitch-black humor instead of transgressive shock tactics. ""Red Right Hand""-- the future theme song of the Scream film franchise-- sets its serial-killer narrative to a seductive swampy groove, and the beautiful piano ballad ""Nobody's Baby Now"" is a work of such wry, understated elegance, Cave originally thought of giving it to Johnny Cash. As Let Love In's signature tracks proved, Cave's love songs could easily turn into death songs, so it was inevitable that he'd devote an entire album to exploring that symbiotic relationship. Murder Ballads has a title so obvious and self-defining, it's amazing that it took the Bad Seeds nine albums to use it. And the last thing you could accuse Cave of is false advertising: Dozens of characters lose their lives over the course of the album, which updates infamous folk tales like ""Stagger Lee"" with enough profanity and gratuitous violence to satisfy the bloodlusty standards of the post-gangsta rap/Quentin Tarantino era. But the Bad Seeds' most lyrically depraved record is also their most musically ornate and accessible, with the band expanding to accommodate Dirty Three violinist Warren Ellis and former Cramps/Sonic Youth stickman Jim Sclavunos (as second percussionist), plus a pair of smoldering duets with PJ Harvey (""Henry Lee"") and Kylie Minogue (the unlikely MTV hit ""Where the Wild Roses Grow""). In fact, with its densely detailed storylines, heart-racing epics (""Song of Joy"", ""The Curse of Millhaven"") and cheeky curtain-closing cover of Bob Dylan's born-again anthem ""Death Is Not the End"", it's hard not to imagine Murder Ballads as some perverse, alternate-universe West End musical production. But look past its comically over-the-top presentation and you realize Cave isn't simply indulging in some subversive genre exercise. He was examining the very idea of poetic license, pushing the limits of what an artist can get away with in a song when writing in character. The Boatman's Call is Cave's plea for redemption, an album every bit as dignified as its predecessor is deranged. After spending much of his career spinning yarns out of other people's misery, Cave-- emerging from a divorce and a highly publicized but short-lived affair with PJ Harvey-- comes clean about his own. On the stirring piano-based hymns ""Into My Arms"" and ""There Is a Kingdom"", he looks to religion less as a convenient dramatic device and more as the genuine refuge for the lonely soul. Cave had flirted with tender balladry many times before, but whereas previous turns like ""Straight to You"" and ""The Ship Song"" were shot through the Bad Seeds' widescreen lens, here, the atmosphere is so spare and intimate, you feel like you're curled up inside Cave's piano. More than any other album in this batch of reissues, The Boatman's Call is greatly enriched by a remaster that amplifies the magnitude of Cave's loneliness, from the burning-ember ambience of ""Lime Tree Arbour"" to Ellis' trembling violin lines on the absolutely devastating ""Far From Me"". But even though The Boatman's Call is Cave's most confessional, open-hearted album, its sense of sorrow and catharsis transcends a strictly personal interpretation. It speak volumes about the album's universality that its songs have soundtracked everything from Michael Hutchence's funeral to Shrek 2. Following that triumphant triptych, it would be another four years before Cave reemerged with a new album, during which he finally kicked his recurring, 15-year heroin addiction once and for all. Not surprisingly, No More Shall We Part carries the tentative air of an artist and band trying to reconnect with their muse, and with one another. No More feels more like a transitory album than a definitive statement, one that showcases the increasingly crucial role of Ellis' mournful violin-playing to the band's sound, but perhaps at the expense of founding members Blixa Bargeld (who would leave the band in 2003), and Mick Harvey (who would follow suit in 2009). Tellingly, Bargeld and Harvey are nowhere to be seen in the No More set's accompanying installment of Do You Love Me, after making prominent appearances in each of the series' previous episodes. But amid its stately sprawl and gorgeous guest vocals from folk legends Kate and Anna McGarrigle, No More Shall We Part effectively points the way from the desolate, piano-bar introspection of The Boatman's Call toward the swagger, bombast, and cutting humor that would define the Bad Seeds' output throughout the rest of the coming decade. Following No More's release, Cave would switch labels to Anti- and, with 2003's Nocturama, ignite a more raucous, raw-powered phase of his career that's currently manifested itself in the Bad Seeds' hellacious alter-ego act, Grinderman. But if No More Shall We Part seems less distinguished next to Cave's mid-90s streak and his reinvigorated Anti- output, it represents an important turning point in the Bad Seeds discography. At the onset of the 2000s, Cave had essentially completed the transformation from being an artist who would soundtrack your funeral into one who could provide the first-dance song at your wedding; No More Shall We Part marks that pivotal moment where Cave regains the sensation in his red right hand.","The latest batch of Mute's deluxe reissues shows that the 1990s were very good to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

"Wallahi Le Zein!! Wezin, Jakwar And Guitar Boogie From The Islamic Republic Of Mauritania",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4fea9e61561daa6423/1:1/w_160/48f948ac.jpg,2011-05-24 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15470-wallahi-le-zein-wezin-jakwar-and-guitar-boogie-from-the-islamic-republic-of-mauritania/,Latitudes,"Most countries have some sort of music industry. It may be small or a little ramshackle but it's there, helping to make recordings available in some sort of semi-orderly fashion. It promotes performances, broadcasts music, talks about music in publications. Mauritania's Beydane and Haratine music has no industry to promote it-- the country is one of the few places in the world with no private or even state system in place to capture and disseminate music. The music happens live, played by musicians hired by an audience; it could be a wedding party, an official function, or just a group of friends who want to do a little dancing. The majority of the musicians live and work in Nouakchott, the sprawling, mostly improvised capital city Mauritania is a vast country, bigger than Texas and New Mexico combined, but in much of that space there are no people. Nearly every one of the country's roughly three million people lives in the Southwest, near the coast and the Senegal River, and a full third of them are in Nouakchott. The Beydane (who we call Moors) and the Haratine are Mauritania's dominant ethnic groups, and their language, a dialect of Arabic called Hassaniya, is the most widely spoken (along with French, which is used mostly in official contexts). To describe Mauritanian Beydane and Haratine music is superficially simple: It consists primarily of singers, improvising based on poetry, hand percussion, and guitar or a similar local stringed instrument-- guitar has since 1976 largely supplanted the tidinitt lute (played by men) and the ardin harp (played by women). The guitar is electric, I should add. This, in a city where electricity service is not comprehensive, to say the least. There have been a few attempts to record Beydane guitar music over the years in a controlled, high-fidelity environment, and one could get the impression from listening to these that the music is pretty sedate, but this is misleading. As one listen to Wallahi Le Zein quickly shows, this is music of immense energy. Trying to record it in a studio robs it of the primary engine that drives it, which is audience response. The musicians crank it up when the audience steps it up, and cool it down when the audience gets tired. Matthew Lavoie, the set's compiler, at first attempted to make some of his own recordings in specially arranged sessions with an audience, but to hear him tell it in his extensive liner notes, the lack of a proper music-making occasion resulting in sterile recordings that got the technical bits right but missed on the spirit of the music. But Lavoie was truly in love with this music, and wouldn't be deterred. Over the course of years and many visits to Mauritania, he collected privately recorded cassettes of performances until he had a massive archive to draw from. It's not unusual for the people paying the musicians to record a performance for a souvenir-- as you can imagine, though, the quality of those recordings is often abysmal, so sorting for a set of tracks that both captured the spirit of the music as it's normally performed and satisfied even some very rudimentary standards of fidelity took some work. The compiler's passion for the music and knowledge of its history, performance and underlying theory is on full display in the thick booklet that comes with this set-- expanding it into a book wouldn't be out of the question. Without getting too far into the specifics of it, all of the music on this set is built around a very basic modal structure. There are a set number of modes in the music, which must be played in a certain order, and each mode has two different rhythmic characters (one legato, one staccato), to be played in a specific order. But beyond that, it's wide open. Tempo, the actual melody played within the mode, the play of voice against guitar, the rhythm, and a host of other factors come into play in every piece. You have to really study the music to hear the ingredients as distinct from one another. The recordings are raw, essentially field recordings. People can be heard talking to the musicians, whistling; I swear there's one track where I can hear a chicken at one point. Some are instrumental, some are vocal, and most have muffled hand drums driving the rhythm. The singing is melismatic and full-bore-- it's recognizable if you know much Arabic of West African music. But the meat of this music for a listener who speaks no Hassaniya is the guitar. There is some breathtaking guitar playing in this music, a manic, psychedelic edge and free-floating intensity that makes me think of Hendrix playing ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" but like that all the time. Distortion from blown speaker cones is a common sonic element, but you hear the occasional pedal or strange flanged tone as well. The music doesn't flow in the sense that Westerners typically expect dance music to flow. It will stop abruptly, turn in unexpected directions, stutter in the middle of a phrase-- this is how the music works, musicians responding to what their audience is doing or saying, how much money it's throwing their way. All of it is decided on the spot-- these musicians don't rehearse written pieces of music, and they frequently perform with musicians they haven't played with before. On a first listen, when you haven't acclimated yourself to what these men and women are doing with the music, it is disorienting. But once you learn to flow with it, it's a rush a minute, and the skill of the players really is something to behold. Baba ould Hembara does this thing on his tracks where he's hammering the strings with his left hand, finely articulating full melodies with a hammer-on-- it sounds like the chatter of birds as much as a guitar. To isolate one example, the distorted, sandstorm psych onslaught of Mohamed Guitar's ""banjey"" (banjey is a form, not a title), is pretty easy for anyone to understand. Wallahi Le Zein is somewhat similar to a Sublime Frequencies radio or field recording release, except that this has a much deeper interest in the musicological, historical, and cultural underpinnings of what's going on here. Lavoie isn't just putting this stuff out there for you-- the liner notes are an educational document reflecting years of research and real, focused passion for the subject matter, rather than a basic interest in otherness. This is in some ways this compilation's greatest gift-- this is the first curated collection of unfiltered Mauritanian guitar music ever, and I'm glad it's been introduced with such thoroughness and care.","This is a rare comp of Mauritania's Beydane and Haratine music, one of the few global sounds without any music industry surrounding it.

Noir,Blue Sky Black Death,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aefe13d197565213a1dc/1:1/w_160/b89c86f9.jpg,2011-05-24 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15400-noir/,Fake Four,"Blue Sky Black Death may want to do without guest vocalists for a little while. West Coast producers Kingston and Young God teamed up with a different low-key singer on each of their last couple of albums, but the real allure was still in the duo's layered, expansive instrumentals. Then there was the drama a few years back over Jean Grae team-up The Evil Jeanius; the New York MC went on Craigslist and MySpace to protest the ""unauthorized"" use of her rhymes (she said it wasn't the beat-makers' fault). BSBD have collaborated with plenty of other indie rappers, most recently including tourmates CunninLynguists, but their latest album suggests they can acquit themselves just fine on their own. As Clams Casino's first beat tape earlier this year demonstrated, some of the best rap instrumentals these days can work equally well as moody electronic music, drifting naturally between the worlds of hip-hop or R&B and ambient, post-dubstep, or chillwave. Noir has a similar way of wringing strangely affecting emotional grandeur from the rudiments of sound, though BSBD's style relies less on glitch or drone and more on starry-eyed orchestral vastness. Using an impressively naunced deployment of strings, piano, and guitar as well as drum loops and hazy synths, the album has a patient, steady beauty, ranging from glowing panoramas evoking M83 to the classical-informed abstraction of Anticon acts like Dosh and Son Lux. The duo's acronym is apparently skydiver slang, popularized in the 1994 thriller Drop Zone. It implies, ""Sure, appreciate the majesty of nature all you want, but if something goes wrong you'll leave a grisly corpse."" If Noir can't quite fully embody that essential paradox-- it's not particularly noir-ish, either-- it still succeeds in communicating incomprehensible hugeness through sonically detailed tracks with an almost narrative-like structure. There are several standouts, but a good place to start is ""Sleeping Children Are Still Flying"", which uses a humid Southern-rock guitar solo and languidly triumphant drum programming to support a string section, a children's choir, and a snippet of dialogue from classic 1986 coming-of-age drama Stand By Me: River Phoenix is talking about dreams, and missed chances. While the kids and the symphonic elements would have no trouble fitting in on an indie pop beach fantasy by Air France, those blues-drenched licks could just as easily soundtrack one of the Weeknd's dangerous liaisons. Noir isn't completely instrumental, then, and in fact uses sung samples as well as the spoken-word variety. But the strongest voice here is BSBD's own-- wide-screen and Technicolor, to mix sensory metaphors. An aching soul vocal from Solomon Burke's ""Don't Give Up on Me"" is secondary to a sighing, silvery arrangement and pulsing bass on brief interlude ""Falling Short""; Dusty Springfield's version of ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" complements the hypnotic repetitions and emotional anguish of ""Farewell to the Former World"", which despite its melancholy theme has a snare-heavy rhythm track fit for blasting through car windows on hot days. Or for rapping over: Three years after BSBD's last proper instrumental album, Babygrande release Late Night Cinema, Noir again proves the duo don't need singers or rappers to make their music felt. But that doesn't mean an aspiring MC or two might not be able to make use of their services anyway.","Like Clams Casino's recent work, this veteran hip-hop production duo crafts versatile, moody instrumentals with a patient, steady beauty.

It's a Corporate World,Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4d5e6ef95969321d9d/1:1/w_160/a328f535.jpg,2011-05-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15468-its-a-corporate-world/,Warner Bros.Quite Scientific,"Live, Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. perform in logo-emblazoned NASCAR regalia. Couple this fact with their moniker and the title of their debut LP, It's a Corporate World, and you might peg them as some sort of subversive, Adbusters-influenced project. But Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. are a sweet, fairly unassuming electro-tinged indie pop band; nothing less, but precious little more. The name, the costumes, and the anti-corporate rumblings all but melt away once you hit play on It's a Corporate World. Bands these days need a hook to stand out from the pack, I realize. If only a few more of those hooks had made it onto the record. Joshua Epstein and Daniel Zott's collaboration began with a mutual interest in production work, and indeed, Corporate World is both unerringly orderly and rife with background flourishes. Even at their least remarkable, their melodies get by on good-natured exuberance, and the headphone-friendly tarting-up they're given proves time and again the band's best maneuver. Both Epstein and Zott have the sort of warm, softish indie-dude voices that carry their tunes without stepping out in front of them. Nearly everything about the record's so agreeable, so well-engineered and aerodynamic, it just glides. Corporate World leans gently into its melodic curves, leaving most of the twisting and turning to the production. Their debut EP, Horse Power, concluded with a note-perfect cover of the Beach Boys' ""God Only Knows"", more an airtight, Pomplamoose-style layering exercise than a reimagination of that familiar tune. Much of Corporate World feels similarly stacked, although left to their own melodic devices, these dudes aren't exactly Brian Wilson. More often than not, they smartly doll up these straightforward tunes in chirpy harmonies and electroid gurgles, coloring in the clean lines of their melodies. Highlight ""Nothing But Our Love"" gets along on a chipper enough melody, but its the subtly twittering guitar doodle and head-nod clatter of its beat that actually do the head-sticking. Same with ""Vocal Chords"", a pleasant enough tune boosted by a Tina Weymouth-style bass bump and flittery guitar. But the sonic dazzle outshines the melodies at the heart of many of these tracks. It's not the main vocal line of ""Skeletons"" you'll take with you into the next track, but the croon swimming through its background; even lilting opener ""Morning Thought,"" one of the set's stronger numbers, seems outmatched by its shimmering keyboards and shuffling rhythm. And when they throw too much on the track, as on the murky ""The Fisherman"" or the snarling, somewhat out-of-place ""When I Open My Eyes"", the record's easygoing pace halts. Sonically rich but melodically staid, Corporate World ultimately brings to mind Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.'s extramusical affairs: alluring at first, but a bit wanting under the surface.","Despite all the NASCAR-related playfulness, Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. are a sweet, fairly unassuming electro-tinged indie pop band.

Alegrías,Howe Gelb & a Band of Gypsies,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3e5e6ef95969321d8c/1:1/w_160/01460ef6.jpg,2011-05-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15455-alegrias/,Fire,"Real estate maxim/cliché: You can change everything but the view. Howe Gelb is the view. Over the course of his long career, Gelb-- either as a solo artist or more frequently with his band Giant Sand-- has dabbled in folk, country, alt-rock, gospel, and most combinations thereof. At the center of this shifting guitar music is Gelb's flat sing-talk. Gelb's voice is distinct-- a concrete-gray, nasal uttering-- but it's his dry, funny rambling that has attracted a mild cult following. His latest album, Alegrías, credited to Howe Gelb & a Band of Gypsies, is another changing-of-the-drapes renovation, a soft left into flamenco-tinged gypsy folk that was recorded in Spain with a group of Andalucian gypsies (including, notably, guitarist Raimundo Amador). You might think this sort of far-flung collaborating (Gelb hails from Tucson) would produce results notably removed Gelb's past, but the singer's refusal to bow to his surroundings is arguably his artistic strength. It's important to note that Alegrías isn't an album of traditional music: It's closer to ""Howe Gelb hangs out with some gypsy musicians and they make Howe Gelb music."" Gelb even pokes fun at his sonic wanderlust, dryly singing, ""I walk around like I own/ The sound of cowboy boots on cobble stone."" One of my favorite aspects of Alegrías is that Gelb all but drops the gypsy conceit when it suits him, the arrangements veering back toward the type of cracked-sidewalk acoustic picking that is his default form. Still, this is a nice fit. The music's natural rhythmic shiftiness and floral accents balance Gelb's heavy-lidded charm without overwhelming him. In the realm of middle-aged-guys-mumbling-poetically, Gelb lacks (has always lacked) David Berman's precision or Aidan Moffat's liver, but he's self-effacing and casual. He favors scenes over stories, observation over revelation. Unlike a lot of his peers, Gelb has never developed a cult of personality (early, out-of-print Giant Sand albums are currently being reissued to shockingly little fanfare). He sort of represents the median of smart underground songwriters, in part because his songs never even attempt universal truths or gushing emotion. He has never seemed on the verge of breaking out, and it's easier to appreciate Gelb's career in sum. Alegrías is a pleasant stylistic diversion, another in a long series of non-revelations. That's Gelb's appeal: a guy, a thoughtful guy, who won't press you into adoration, even when he deserves it.","Giant Sand leader takes a soft left into flamenco-tinged gypsy folk that was recorded in Spain with a group of Andalucian gypsies.

Demolished Thoughts,Thurston Moore,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af529d034d5c69bf46d2/1:1/w_160/124bcb5c.jpg,2011-05-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15474-demolished-thoughts/,Matador,"The first words you're likely to hear in relation to Thurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts are ""acoustic"" and ""folk."" Indeed, the Beck Hansen-helmed album was made mostly with six- and 12-string acoustic guitars, harps, violins, bass (sometimes upright), and drums. But to call this record ""folk"" or ""acoustic"" is to mistakenly suggest that it's relaxed comfort music from an aging dude who still sings about teenage riots with his hoary rock band. Rather, Demolished Thoughts is as immediate and form-warping as Moore's work with Sonic Youth, comprising nine anxious, charged songs about fleeting time and failing happiness, played with veteran resilience. Jokes about old men and their Martins need not apply. The essentials of this project might recall Trees Outside the Academy, Moore's song-oriented solo album from 2007. (The ""song-oriented"" distinction is necessary if reductive, as Moore seems to release between one and, oh, 47 experimental discs every year.) Violinist Samara Lubelski is the only Trees alumna on Demolished Thoughts. Moore returns with a consistent, cohesive band-- Lubelski, harpist Mary Lattimore, guitarist Bill Nace, Hansen and his regular collaborators, drummer Joey Waronker and bassist Bram Inscore. As such, this is a much more rigorous and singular album, constructed with a definite, deliberate sonic approach that his previous solo work has foregone. Trees had its moments, but, as a whole, it was uneasy and unsettled, as though Moore finally made it into a studio to record ideas he'd tucked away in notebooks during Sonic Youth tours. Demolished Thoughts feels less like a side-project of afterthoughts, more like a careful album cut with a smartly assembled band. Instruments aside, Demolished Thoughts isn't built like typical folk music, or even the chiseled chamber folk of the last decade or so. The hazy, nearly seven-minute ""Orchard Street"", for instance, gets through its lyrics in nearly half its running time; the second, instrumental half sounds like an acoustic reinvention of the glorious codas from Sonic Youth's Murray Street, the role of the pounding drums taken by battered guitar strings, the squall of the electric guitars replicated with harp runs and violin trills. The album's other longer stretch, the appropriately titled ""Space"", moves in perfectly expanding and contracting waves. Moore enters with the tone of someone who's given up on patience: ""I used to have all the time in the world/ Cruising galaxies in search of gold,"" he sings, the unease in his voice dismissing any back-porch associations. Even at their prettiest, like the slow-rolling and sad-eyed ""Benediction"" or the gently exhaling closer, ""January"", these songs move in unexpected ways, whether it's the players pushing into unlikely patterns or the production embellishing some unseen aspect. As with his other band, Moore succeeds by folding great ideas into otherwise good songs. Beck's production is actually as essential and interesting as these tunes. He stretches Moore's songs without polishing them, giving them a pop number's scope and ambition without seeming obvious or pedantic. ""Circulation"" is a nervous collage of busy images-- needles hitting records, friends on the move, speakers, lights, cries, shots. Hansen pushes the core pieces of the song close together, so that Inscore's bass lashes violently against Moore's layers of heavy-handed strums. And on ""In Silver Rain With a Paper Key"", Hansen adds a trail of echo to Moore's plaintive tone, allowing the words to float like dust among guitars and string parts. Not lo-fi per se but purposefully damaged, the recording mimics Moore's loneliness and disorientation if only by way of atmosphere. Moore, who will turn 53 this summer, is several years older than many of the bandleaders to emerge as indie rock luminaries with his success and staying power-- J Mascis, Henry Rollins, Frank Black, for obvious examples. That's reason enough to be sidetracked by the talk of mellow folk vibes. While Moore's been putting out records for three decades now, Demolished Thoughts feels vital and purposed, more like a debut than an encore. It's the work of a restless artist fighting successfully through his own skin to not only outstrip our expectations of how he sounds but also of the sort of music acoustic guitars and harps can make. With Demolished Thoughts, Thurston Moore solo albums have become more than fields of noise throwaways spiked with the occasional gem, more than Sonic Youth stopgaps. A lot of people retire after 30 years, but Moore has added another great line to an overwhelming résumé.","The Sonic Youth frontman gets production assistance from Beck on a rich and satisfying acoustic-oriented LP.

In Blank,Title Tracks,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af27b1335d7bf1699ece/1:1/w_160/88684b6c.jpg,2011-05-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15438-in-blank/,Ernest Jenning,"After recording almost every instrument himself on It Was Easy, Washington, DC's John Davis (former Q And Not U drummer and member of Georgie James) has enlisted collaborators Andrew Black and Michael Cotterman for In Blank, his second album as Title Tracks. While It Was Easy was clearly written by an accomplished, pop-smart musician, its gentle eclecticism and mild singer-songwriter indulgences made it feel a little too clean and calculated. With In Blank, Davis has tapped into something vital that even the best backing band can't automatically afford: confidence. In Blank is, for the most part, a raucous blast of power-pop, its mono recording nicely balancing the inherent tunefulness of these fast-paced, quick-tempered songs. The first third of the album boasts a blur of high-energy cuts that shake with the tenuous endurance of Hearts of Oak-era Ted Leo. Despite being jammed with memorable hooks (the sneering shoutability of the excellent ""Turn Your Face"") and riffs (the elastic guitar that snaps all over ""Light Sleepers""), these songs work thanks to their continuity (and the constant pogo of Cotterman's bass). Sounding as if they were all meticulously rehearsed and then recorded in one breathless, blurry streak, their energy feels infinite. But, alas, Davis falls into humdrum Elvis Costello homage on the album's sagging middle section. Davis has a lot in common with Costello vocally, so it's not as if he can't hold his own-- but the songs themselves either meander a little too much (""All Tricks"") or seem like flimsy Xeroxes. Not to mention, when stationed next to those tight-wound first 11 minutes, they dissolve from memory, feeling like an unfortunate step backwards. Luckily, Davis shares a certain kinship with another power-pop legend, New Pornographer Carl Newman. ""No Air"", which takes pot shots at ""artists whose real skill, fleeting or not, is that they don't have anything to say,"" has a fire in its belly reminiscent of early Pornos, while ""Cain and the Twigs"" carries some of the bright, simply stated hallmarks of Newman's solo debut, The Slow Wonder. These are strong tracks that showcase Davis' firm handle of sharply orchestrated pop, but ultimately, In Blank's songwriting peters out a little. If Davis can continue to find the courage he frequently taps into here, he could cut it even looser next time.","Former Q and Not U drummer John Davis offers his second album as Title Tracks, a raucous blast of fast-paced, quick-tempered power-pop.

Confetti,A Lull,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4c13d197565213a266/1:1/w_160/5257e750.jpg,2011-05-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15466-confetti/,MushLujoSomething in Construction,"The video to Confetti opener ""Weapons For War"" begins in a field. There are shots of tall grass and wild flowers and berries, as well as the insects whose drone provides a segue to the song's forthcoming hum. It works really well. A Lull are a Chicago outfit that specialize in rangy, wildly percussive indie pop that takes a lot of its rhythmic cues from Sigur Rós' most recent LP, 2008's Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust (translation: ""With a buzz in our ears we play endlessly""), as well as that of frontman Jónsi's 2010 solo outing, Go. Both of those records demonstrated the Icelanders' transition into more contained pop formats, though the kineticism of Go in particular is the better jumping off point. Like this wide-open field, it was a record alive at every turn. A Lull seem to be in similar pursuit, tripping up only in figuring out a way to squeeze it all into song form. Much of what's to be heard on Confetti scans as a series of thoroughly fleshed-out vocal and rhythmic exercises, many of them so similar they congeal into one. Take for instance the blippy rumble of ""Dark Stuff"" or that of ""Some Love"" just before it. While the rhythms and drum sounds vary slightly from one another, the vocal acrobatics of frontman Nigel Evan Dennis tend to glue everything together in an oddly disjointed manner. Elsewhere, ""Pregnancy"" takes on an industrial punch that still seems to sound of a piece with ""Spread It All Around"". This, despite the many angles from which he attacks them. From end to end, Dennis delivers a tireless performance: he darts, he dives, he dips, he sprinkles syllables in fizzy staccato and/or he smears them across a song in breathy fashion. Little of this done without an added layer of processing. While it's clear a lot the textures here have been calibrated just so, the aggressive manner in which this crew opted to produce the record makes for a flat, synthetic sheen that takes a lot away from the multi-dimensional sound multiple drummers can provide. A few years back a North Carolina band made an online splash approaching Animal Collective's pre-Strawberry Jam energy with ears still steeped in a decade's worth of pop-punk and post-emo crunch. The result was bombastic and colorful, but it was also polished in a way that belied the freeform, organic nature of what they seemed to be chasing. That band was Annuals, and A Lull, sonic kin in a lot of ways, have gone a similar route this time out. There are no shortage of interesting directions in which to take music like this. But to package it in a way that strips it of its dynamism, is a good way to shackle it, too.","Latest from a Chicago outfit that specializes in rangy, wildly percussive indie pop and takes cues from Sigur Rós.

Le Secret EP,Alcest,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4b9d034d5c69bf46c8/1:1/w_160/e309cd97.jpg,2011-05-23 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15467-le-secret-ep/,Prophecy,"According to its founder and, for years, its sole studio member, Neige, Alcest have almost always made extremely personal music. Though he founded the band in 1999 and issued four rough-and-raw black metal blasts two years later, he didn't properly debut Alcest until 2005, with the two-track, 27-minute EP Le Secret. After 2001's Tristesse Hivernale, he'd realized that direct black metal wouldn't allow him to communicate the intimacy of his ideas, so on Le Secret, a typhoon of blast beats and tremolo guitar essentially created a cocoon for his delicate French voice. Long passages of gentle drift-- birdcalls, operatic introductions, quietly galloping guitars-- surrounded those bits of fury. Those perpetually nested sounds were, it turns out, the musical manifestations of things Neige had seen in adolescent dreams: ""Since my childhood, I've had the impression of being in contact with a luminous, far-off country. I have named it trivially 'Fairy Land,'"" he explained in a 2006 interview. ""My goal with Alcest is to transpose in musique my memories of this Fairy Land... beyond all terrestrial and real beauty."" Neige recently re-recorded those early tracks with full-time Alcest drummer Winterhalter; Prophecy Productions combined the retakes with the original recordings, reissuing the long out-of-print work in five distinct editions. There are two versions of the vinyl LP, the standard jewel case CD, and a version of the disc encased in cloth and a heavy cardboard sleeve. For the Alcest obsessive, one version even puts the cloth-and-cardboard disc inside an engraved wooden box with a key, a handwritten lyrics sheet from Neige, a brooch, and a few ivy leaves, ostensibly plucked from the boughs of Fairy Land. Pressed in an edition of 500, that disc costs just less than $75. The new takes on the two old songs-- ""Le Secret"" and ""Elévation""-- closely mirror their forebears in structure and style. Both the production and volume are enhanced, with the lonely guitar notes and bass mumbles at the start of the title track now sounding less like separate whispers. The drums are bigger and, thanks to Winterhalter, they're bolder, often pulling away from the relentless blasts Neige once played by himself. Winterhalter's the better rock drummer, adding nuance and flash where his boss once simply bored forward. The new versions are better at being pretty, too, especially during ""Elévation"". Here, Neige sends spectral harmonies floating through a tense electric guitar matrix, and, for the first time, it indeed sounds like a dreamland. In that same 2006 interview, Neige understandably balked when asked about the ""sinister mode"" of the vocals. Here, you'd have a hard time making that misinterpretation. This is Le Secret as it's always been, then, just emboldened and improved by the experience and expansion of Alcest. Still, it's hard to hear this second iteration of Le Secret and not be at least a bit skeptical about its cash-in nature. These aren't radical reinventions or even vast improvements on the originals, which, though long out-of-print, have long been available for download online. Even if those first recordings sounded more rudimentary or rushed, the first Le Secret succeeded with the same sidewinding, ultra-dynamic structures and mix of brutality and beauty found on this version. These re-recordings succeed only in upping the production and performance value, not in documenting how they funnel directly into the later (and better) songs on 2007's fine Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde or 2010's brilliant Écailles de lune. Sure, this retrench proves that Neige has developed as a guitarist and vocalist, and that, with the addition of Winterhalter, Alcest have improved as a band. But you could hear that much throughout Écailles de lune, not to mention Neige's progression as a composer and arranger. Indeed, over the last half-decade, he's become better at building transitions and at creating spaces where disparate ideas sit naturally with each other. Le Secret's shifts between bird calls and black metal, between roar and repose, felt rushed and uneven in 2005; in 2011, despite how much Alcest have progressed since that start, they still feel that way. They just sound better doing it.","Eclectic French metal artist Neige recently re-recorded his second EP and presents the results in five distinct editions.

Casablanca Nights,Johan Agebjörn,by: Stephen M.

Instead, it's almost certainly a nod to Casablanca Records, one of the most prominent labels of the 1970s. While it did sign the likes of Cher, Kiss, and Parliament, Casablanca was best known as a haven for disco artists, including Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Santa Esmeralda, Village People, and a deep roster of one- and no-hit wonders. It's even rumored that Steve Guttenberg's character in the Village People film Can't Stop the Music was based on Casablanca founder Neil Bogart (no relationship to Humphrey). It's no shock that Agebjörn would invoke this bellwether of pop history for his latest album. He is one of several Swedish producers enamored with various American and European strains of disco, and his two albums with Sally Shapiro reveal a steadfast belief that heartache is best conveyed via soft vocals, shimmery synths, modulated bass lines, and pulsating beats. Casablanca Nights is his chance to play curator as well as producer, hand-picking such acts as Shapiro, CFCF, Friday Bridge, and Le Prix. The album plays like a label sampler you might dig out of the dollar bin and wonder why none of the artists made it bigger. Despite that title, Agebjörn isn't abandoning his signature Italo disco-derived sound for a more American style. His production remains exquisitely lush and luxuriant. On ""The Last Day of Summer"", the relatively robust vocals by Queen of Hearts stand out on the album, and it's too bad she doesn't appear more often. Many of the vocalists blur together over the course of Casablanca Nights, although Shapiro remains Agebjörn's most captivating muse, her expressive vocals illuminating each one of her songs. Most of Agebjörn's songs create the same sort of yearning, thumping dancefloor melancholy, differentiated more by their lyrics than by their instrumentation or their tone. As Casablanca Nights makes its way to morning, he introduces a few new sounds and tricks, to varying degrees of success. ""Alice"", a collaboration with Le Prix, Fred Ventura, and Shapiro, is the most intriguing detour, drumming in some new wave influences from the early 1980s to counterbalance the 1970s sounds. Thanks to the halting chorus and the dynamic boy-girl vocals, the combination of styles is intriguing, not only because these two eras have such different concerns but mostly because similar experiments on Casablanca Nights prove much less compelling. By the time the requisite chill-out closer comes along-- ""Stranger (Chill Remix)"" with Halftone-- Agebjörn has already thoroughly chilled out to a sequence of downtempo songs like ""Le Noir et le Blanc Sur le Piano"" (where Shapiro sings in French) and ""Memories of Satie"" (with CFCF). Intriguing in their reach if not necessarily their execution, those two numbers weigh down the second half, such that ""Stranger"" doesn't sound like the sunrise to end Casablanca Nights, but an abrupt finale that plays to a long-empty dancefloor. Granted, Agebjörn's intention isn't historical re-creation or even dance-party endurance, but a kind of musical evocation that opens up more conceptual possibilities than perhaps he's willing to explore. Yet, this time-machine quality means the music serves similar purposes to its influences: The songs are meant to be immersive, enveloping, and most of all transportive. Where disco went far beyond mere escapism in the 1970s, Casablanca Nights only gets you out of 2011 for a few sweet minutes.","Swedish Italo disco producer's latest album features frequent collaborator Sally Shapiro, as well as CFCF.

Brilliant!

Was it producer Frank Black? Argos himself? Jasper ""the Dolphin"" Future? Did anybody actually think the problem with Art Brut was all the talking? I rather thought that was like the whole point. Granted, you either love the talking-singing thing or you hate it (see also: the Hold Steady), but at least it was their thing. And beyond being totally, instantly recognizable, it wasn't all that bad of a look for Art Brut, either: Argos' witty, conversational lyrics were always well served by his spoken delivery, offset by the band's playfully slick rock session band chops. But now Argos has gone from ranting about halting a make-out session to turn up a pop song, to singing (scarcely), ""I want to be played in the background while couples drink their wine/ That would be a triumph with a voice like mine/ Everybody wants to feel sexy sometimes/ I can make it happen with a voice like mine."" Well, at least he hasn't lost his wry sense of humor. But about this newfound singing business: Argos has discovered a voice that sounds a bit like Jarvis Cocker's, only if he'd lost it after a long night out drinking-- a little hoarse, whispering low so as not to upset the hangover. So the album opens with what might as well be its mission statement, ""Clever Clever Jazz"", a typically dry-humored song about a band punching above its weight: ""Sorry that it doesn't sound like it's planned... can't you see we're doing the best that we can?"" Next is another entry into the band's ""Weekend"" trilogy (now extended, Douglas Adams-like, to four songs if you count B-side ""Really Bad Weekend""), ""Lost Weekend"", and while it's as clever and sweet as any of its predecessors, Argos' intonation doesn't exactly do it any extra favors. Some songs work fine with the singing: The above-quoted ballad ""Sexy Sometimes"" succeeds by dint of making Argos' very struggle the subject of its gently plodding fun, as does ""Is Dog Eared"" to some degree. And then halfway through the album, it seems like even Argos has started to think all this is a bad idea, reverting back for the remainder to his old patterns of speech and shouting. The results are, unsurprisingly, some of the album's strongest songs, largely because Argos just gets out of the way of his own lyrics. ""Martin Kemp Welch Five A-Side Football Rules!"" is a scorcher, covering the familiar Art Brut territories of football and unrequited schoolboy crushes. ""Axel Rose"" raucously praises its subject as being the sort of guy you'd want in your corner when giving the world the finger. Maybe best of this side is ""Sealand"", ending the album on a drifting note, a dream of starting a sovereign nation of two at sea that affectingly flips the motto of It's a Bit Complicated standout ""People in Love"": ""People in love lie around and get fat/ I didn't want us to end up like that."" In all this talk about talking, the band Argos originally hired through an ad in the back pages of the NME gets short shrift. But trust that they still sound very much like a band hired from the back pages of the NME: competent rock hands with equal flair for squealing guitar solos and pop backing vocals, easy showmen but not exactly showy.

Strange Hearts,Secret Cities,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3db1335d7bf1699eef/1:1/w_160/d040c2d7.jpg,2011-05-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15457-strange-hearts/,Western Vinyl,"Before its vintage bass line arrives, the first we hear of ""Pebbles"", a mid-album highlight on Strange Hearts, is crickets chirping. They seem to stay for the entirety of the song. That's a testament to this North Dakota outfit's fondness for atmosphere, something they've managed to spread out evenly across all 11 of these 1960s-indebted harmonizers. ""Pebbles"", as if by design, sounds like it was recorded for transistor radio play. The bass is dewey. The harmonies are starlit. The theremin is ripe. And then there's the matter of MJ Parker's opening line: ""Pebbles, it's time to go home now/ The drag race is over/ You smashed up your car, and now our dream is over."" It's all draped in a nice, light fuzz. But as Real Estate, for example, use pools of reverb to give their songs their own sort of submerged ambiance, Secret Cities line their more contemporary sensibilities with a layer of fuzz for similar reasons. In this case, it's not at all about obfuscation and more in the service of added warmth. Some of that can be attributed to their decision to record Strange Hearts in the basement of a recently abandoned bank in Kansas City, but most of it's in the citrus-splashed feel of their songwriting. Opener ""Always Friends"" kicks things off with a light-footed guitar melody that-- just after they lace their second verse with some well-managed whistling-- gains strength as it goes. At the moment, Secret Cities find themselves in a lane with the Morning Benders and Grizzly Bear, the latter a band whose music, in juxtaposition, has a big brother-like energy to it. That's because in contrast, these three seem to have taken a less agressively tailored approach to tapping similar veins of the 60s. As they are on ""Pebbles"" or the shuffle of ""Love Crime"", Secret Cities live and die by period-specific vocal harmonies, as mastered early on by the Zombies and Shangri-La's, just to name a couple. But Parker and fellow vocalist Charlie Gokey, both with well-suited cords for this kind of stuff, enjoy a great deal of verve in the manic rhythms of Alex Abnos. The racket they're able to muster together in the process is enough to set them apart from the pack. A song like ""Ice Cream Scene"" takes a few hairpin turns before settling into a two-minute breakdown outro that's assertive and rambunctious enough to belie their twee-est of tendencies. Elsewhere, ""Brief Encounter"" metes out psychedelic fare that's equally muscular. Organs bounce. Voice entwines. Horns march in. It could signal a parade just as easily as a funeral. Lively atmosphere either way.","With a love of both atmosphere and 1960s harmonies, this North Dakota band finds itself in a lane with the Morning Benders and Grizzly Bear.

We Are the Champions,JEFF the Brotherhood,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3b13d197565213a24e/1:1/w_160/67e28b92.jpg,2011-05-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15452-we-are-the-champions/,Infinity Cat Recordings,"Nashville's JEFF the Brotherhood are two brothers, Jamin and Jake Orrall. One's on guitar and vocals; the other mans the drums. They also co-run Infinity Cat Recordings with their father, singer/songwriter Robert Ellis Orrall, the only man in the world that can say he wrote songs for Shenandoah and Lindsay Lohan. JEFF's been an ongoing concern since 2002, but the brothers Orrall have logged time in plenty of bands, including the earliest incarnation of Be Your Own Pet. Like Pet, JEFF was fond of the fuzzy spastic two-to-three-minute punk-pop tune, but they were also fond of being unpredictable. Jamin and Jake were just as likely to say their peace in 30 seconds as they were to stretch things out for 14 minutes. After numerous tours and releases, 2009's Heavy Days saw the Orralls focusing their powers and presenting themselves as an economy-sized psych-rock outfit, an Eagles of Death Metal with one less mouth to feed and a lot more pot in the glove compartment. Big and heavy but still quick on its feet, Heavy Days was a step forward that could please both longtime fans and those new to the party. That said, anyone who's been tracking the moves the Orralls have made might be thrown off a bit by the way We Are the Champions kicks off, and I'm not talking about the rap-radio-exclusive airhorn that sounds off at the start of ""Hey Friend"". It's the song proper, and its remarkable similarity to what good Weezer sounds like, which might surprise. Everything about the tune-- its loping mid-tempo cadence, Jake Orrall's Cuomo-like vocals, even the tune's simple-simon sentiments (""I've been thinking about your mom/ You can tell me if it's really wrong"")-- makes it sound like a Weezer Blue Album demo. Some might see that as a step backwards for JEFF, but I mean that comparison as a complement. The tune's aw-shucks silliness is as charming as its earworm of a melody is inescapable. There's a fair amount of Heavy Days' brand of amp damage to be found on Champions-- you'll want to skip to ""Cool Out"" or ""Ripper"" to get that fix-- and one sitar-flecked tune (""Health and Strength"") that'd fit right in on a Thee Oh Sees album, but the aforementioned poppier M.O. is the way the majority of this album goes. ""Bummer"" was JEFF's contribution to a split single with Best Coast, but plenty of tunes from Champions, from the gently rumbling ""Diamond Way"" to the awkwardly confident ""Wastoid Girl"", could stand toe-to-toe with anything Best Coast had to offer. It's only fitting that this album signals the beginning of a business partnership between Infinity Cat and the Warner Music Group. We Are the Champions might disappoint some diehard fans, but it's also proof positive that JEFF the Brotherhood can play with the big boys.","Former Be Your Own Pet members add shades of Weezer-like power-pop to their economy-sized psych-rock.

Nursing Home,Let's Wrestle,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af47b1335d7bf1699f00/1:1/w_160/1030f3b4.jpg,2011-05-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15462-nursing-home/,Merge,"Thanks to Odd Future, one of indie's biggest talking points over the past few months has been boys behaving badly. Adolescent and slightly post-adolescent males-- their anger, humor, ennui, cruelty, sensitivity, and self-pity-- have been scrutinized by all manner of thinkpiece-penners and armchair sociologists. A measure of each of those qualities is present in the bratty Brit-punk trio Let's Wrestle and its sophomore effort, Nursing Home. Led by singer and songwriter Wesley Patrick Gonzalez, this band of early twentysomethings comprehensively captures the mindset of young men kicking and screaming against their inevitable transition into adulthood. Musically the group strikes a familiar slacker balance between being engaging and slapdash. Punky 1990s influences abound, running the gamut from Green Day to Supergrass to Weezer, highlighted by some wonderfully melodic lines from bassist Mike Lightning. In general spirit, Let's Wrestle slot neatly alongside those bands as well as recent English groups like the Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, and Art Brut. Much like many of their forebears, these kids also make humor out of idle bullshit-- opener ""In Dreams Part II"" imagines a nighttime phantasmagoria that includes ""two Greek men fighting in a pharmacy"" and a guy bragging about having slept with Queen Victoria. Yet their jokes are also sometimes tinged with meanness-- witness ""Bad Mammaries"", a sour screed against an overly lascivious middle-aged lady. At the same time, Let's Wrestle are capable of tenderness. ""If I Keep on Loving You"" and ""I Am Useful"" are winsome pop songs; meanwhile, ""For My Mother"" expresses true empathy for its titular subject, as Gonzalez and his mates sonically make their most pronounced evocation of Weezer. For the most part, however, you get a snapshot of irresponsible young dudes not giving a fuck, Peter Pans wanting to be boys forever. A few of the songs nail the attitude with their titles alone: ""I'm So Lazy"", ""I Will Not Give In"", and ""I Forgot"". Most fascinating though is ""In the Suburbs"", which finds Gonzalez idealizing a life where ""I'll have dinner with my mother and play computer games all night."" Certainly it's fair to read the song as tongue-in-cheek, but Let's Wrestle also do a really good job of convincing you that they have pretty intimate knowledge of that coddled, layabout lifestyle. These are entirely representative growing pains from a group of kids who seem convinced that being a full-on adult means you might as well be in a Nursing Home.","Brit-punk trio comprehensively captures the mindset of young men kicking and screaming against their inevitable transition into adulthood.

Attention Please / Heavy Rocks,Boris,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af439d034d5c69bf46b3/1:1/w_160/5238cdd0.JPG,2011-05-20 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15460-attention-please-heavy-rocks/,Sargent House,"Boris have never been one for hedged bets or bridled ambitions. In the past 15 years, the Japanese trio has released more than 20 albums of heavy eclecticism-- stoner bludgeons and thrash blasts, dense drones and noise screes. They're the band with Atsuo-- the screaming, gong-banging drummer with one of those arena-rock, hands-off microphones-- and Takeshi, a multi-instrumentalist who plays a double-necked guitar so often and well that it doesn't seem like an affectation. Michio Kurihara, one of the world's best psychedelic guitarists, works as Boris' touring sideman. From former labelmates Sunn O))) to fellow Japanese sonic explorers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, they've also collaborated with a long list of experimental luminaries. All of this seems to be part and parcel to Boris' methodical quest to build a legacy of expansive, new heavy music, where no form is too sacred to break, no idea too mainstream to incorporate. If that's their plan, it's largely worked. Accordingly, there are few release-day gestures more rock star than issuing two albums at the same time, as Boris will do with the slight electropop-and-shoegaze departure Attention Please and the requisite metal grab bag Heavy Rocks. What's more, this is the second Boris LP to sport the title Heavy Rocks; the first was released in 2002, and nearly a decade later, it still stands as one of Boris' best efforts, a landmark distillation of stoner metal and noise rock built with enviable precision and aggression. This moment, then, is not only Boris' look-how-popular-we-are exclamation but also their look-how-much-we've-grown assertion; essentially, Attention Please and Heavy (Heavier?) Rocks are logical next steps for the Boris legacy. But riddled as this pair of albums is with confounding musical indecision and listless stylistic repetition, they mostly serve as reminders of how remarkable and inventive Boris have been and often threaten to be. Heavy Rocks was sturdier back in 2002, while the appropriately titled Attention Please-- even if the more interesting of these two discs-- is a flimsy showcase for Boris guitarist Wata as a would-be college-rock frontwoman. Heavy Rocks does the things you expect a Boris album to do: It explodes open with ""Riot Sugar"", a brutal blues-metal march with a rote, ragged riff and background grunts from the Cult's Ian Astbury. ""Missing Pieces"" alternates between spare guitar drift, gnarls of noise, and an epically forlorn crescendo, while the other 12-minute-plus tune, ""Aileron"", growls and swells before drifting off into a piano-and-distortion haze. For fans of Boris, the material is a double-edged sword: It's the sort of motley metal that brought you to the fold one way or another, but that means you've already heard it-- all of it, from the massive soundscapes on Pink to the dynamic sizzle in Amplifier Worship-- several times before. Here, it's all offered like a mixtape, with no narrative arch or musical momentum. Attention Please at least offers something fresh for Boris. For the first time in the band's long run, Wata takes lead vocal. Her consistent presence offers an atmosphere of patience, plus a cohesiveness that Boris have long since foregone. Sure, she leads the band through several different looks, from the tense, pretty opening title track to the dance-metal anthem ""Party Boy"". During ""See You Next Week"", she drifts like a ghost between a world of broken drum machines and guitars meant more for texture than melody. There's a ruminative instrumental for acoustic guitar, and ""Spoon"", a blustery tumble that-- Wata's willowy vocals aside-- favorably suggests the sound of 1990s American modern rock radio. What's best, the trio doesn't give up on its heavy metal experience; though this album suggests a stylistic mix of new wave and Mazzy Star, Boris play with the rumble and roar of a loud rock band. The bass line during the chiming ""Tokyo Wonder Land"" is a menacing throb, the guitar solo an acid-damaged roar. ""Les Paul Custom '86"" emerges as a dance number through sheets of noise, anchored by a riff that would have fit Earth in 1993. Those tell-all touches and Wata's command suggest that this is the better, if unforeseen, avenue for Boris' future. Though not fully developed, this is a space where they might actually explore without the constraints of reputation and expectation. The heavy metal landscape of 2011 is tailor-made for (and, sort of, by) Boris. Sure, the black metal kids are busy retrenching against boundary breakers like Liturgy and Altar of Plagues, and a whole lot of older burly bros will tell you that stoner, thrash, and melodramatic metal were done better the first time. They're not necessarily wrong, but those sorts of attitudes provide a welcome contrast for the tone of inclusion and acceptance for ideas that permeates not only some of the moment's most exciting metal but also music at large. Whether it's the elegiac folk singer heading for stacks of finely orchestrated keyboards or the black metal band backing its melee with a pure and purposed disco-punk throb, a whole crop of young acts now seem open to the possibilities within their forms. Their audiences largely seem interested in tagging along, too. After all, we obtain and hear music in radically different ways and contexts now than in 1996, when Boris were making their recorded debut as a noisy sludge-metal band from Tokyo. Boris' post-modern eclecticism is, in theory, perfect for this moment. But pastiches and piss-takes-- by and large, the sort of material that's scattered between Attention Please and the second Heavy Rocks-- can only satisfy so much. Boris seem to be racing to stay current, to show that they can change as rapidly as these hyper-wired times. With each new addition to a catalog that's becoming more adulterated each year, we're learning that maybe they can't.","Japanese heavy rock heroes release two LPs at once, but they aren't what you'd expect: one is electropop and shoegaze, the other a metal grab bag.

Darkbloom EP,d’EonGrimes,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e53dcf3ba238a0008307f5e/1:1/w_160/Grimes-dEon-Darkbloom.jpg,2011-05-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15439-darkbloom-ep/,Hippos in TanksArbutus,"On her side of Darkbloom, a split 12"" with fellow Montrealer d'Eon, Claire Boucher of Grimes sounds like a pop star from a distant planet-- distant enough that ""pop star"" is an unfamiliar concept there, but close enough to intercept earthly radio signals and press some bootlegs of Mariah Carey's no. 1s. Boucher's music draws upon a diverse collection of influences (Panda Bear, Salem, Alicia Keys) as she experiments with eerie loops and a stratospheric falsetto. (She says that while recording last year's otherworldly Halfaxa, she ""practiced"" singing in four octaves by listening to Mariah's ""Heartbreaker"".) While Grimes' previous work found her burying her poppier inclinations beneath dense atmospherics and moody textures, her material on Darkbloom melds all of her impulses into a coherent and confident sound, resulting into some of her strongest tracks to date. For Grimes, Darkbloom comes on the heels of a prolific 2010. She released two solid LPs: the melodic and intimate debut Geidi Primes, and the darker, more unified Halfaxa. The latter could be classified as bubblegum macabre; songs like ""Weregild"" and ""Sagrad Прекрасный"" somehow suggested the skeletons from Daft Punk's ""Around the World"" video singing Tiffany songs on karaoke night. I liked Geidi Primes even better, a record that filtered the confessional intimacy of lo-fi bedroom pop (as on the standout track ""Rosa"") through influences including dubstep to synth pop. Boucher's tendency to throw everything in the pot occasionally came off as a lack of unity, but I found its aesthetic miscellany to be one of her debut's charms. ""Everybody thinks I'm boring,"" she sang in a mock-confessional tone on ""Zoal, Face Dancer""-- a sentiment that nobody who heard the record could possibly agree with. Darkbloom, though, announces Grimes' arrival as an avant-pop force. This is largely thanks to the single best song she's ever done, ""Vanessa"", which channels Lykke Li by way of a blissed-out Donna Summer reverie. ""Crystal Ball"", perhaps her most upbeat song yet, is also a stunner. Both tracks display a new, cleaner aesthetic for Grimes-- lushness instead of grain, beats that thump rather than pulse, vocals high and clear in the mix. Still, something else entirely makes Grimes unique. There's an eerie, supernatural undercurrent to these songs, and the moody instrumental pieces that surround them. Chris d'Eon's side of the split, which follows last year's LP Palinopsia, isn't without highlights. His best track is the wistful, R&B-tinged ""Transparency"", a song about the uneventful sex lives of ghosts. Inspired by his longtime interest in Tibetan music, d'Eon figures himself in the Eastern symbol of the hungry ghost, a specter who's back from the beyond just to see his lover's face. Incidentally, not as great as it sounds: ""Do you want be human? Do you want to make love again? I guess that's just the price you're gonna have to pay for transparency."" Over the chorus' icy, arpeggiated synths, he comes to the logical conclusion: ""Doing this was a big mistake."" In spite of d'Eon's weaker material (like the skittish and schmaltzy ""Thousand Mile Trench"") his tracks might have made a decent EP, but either way the two sides of Darkbloom don't work particularly well together. Following Grimes' tracks, which favor mood over story and transcend any particular emphasis on lyrics, d'Eon's half feels overly literal and tethered to the material world: His hungry ghost is left searching for a body to inhabit, while Grimes sounds altogether liberated from hers. Undoubtedly, Boucher hits the highest notes on Darkbloom, proving over the course of just five tracks that she's blossoming into a promising artist-- and one who's developing almost more quickly than we can keep track of. ""I've moved far beyond that,"" she's already remarked of this material in a recent interview with Dummy. ""I'm working on a full-length, which I kind of feel is my first album."" And as the only complaint I've got with her side of Darkbloom is that it's too short, this is indeed cause for excitement.","This split EP pairs tracks from two Montreal artists: the ghostly avant-pop project Grimes and the more literate singer-songwriter d'Eon.

Excerpts,Ensemble,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af40c0084474cd0c1a3a/1:1/w_160/249e90a4.jpg,2011-05-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15456-excerpts/,Fat Cat,"Ensemble is the current nom de plume of Olivier Alary, French-born, Montreal-based composer. You may recognize his name as one of a few contributors to Björk's Medulla, where he served as both a co-writer and remix artist. Or, you might have heard the score he provided for 2009's Last Train Home, a well-received Chinese film about a family of peasants journeying to be reunited. Both are good contextual examples when approaching Alary's work as Ensemble, a project in which he marries elements of film score and classical music to more experimental avenues. It's a note he hits early in Excerpts, his latest. As ""Opening"" opens, Alary arranges for what feel like great orchestral sighs and groans, violins that dance above a layer of low-end that recalls the Montreal post-rock of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. That dichotomy between flight and discord makes for music whose axis is constantly being flipped, whose focal point is always shifting. It's disorienting listening of a very specific type. It's often that music so fit for film suffers without a visual compliment. That's not the case with Excerpts. Alary's work here holds up well on its own, though it's not a record with a whole lot of replay value. Take for instance the many stages of ""Things I Forget"", a piece that stops to change direction several times within its own five-minute running time. ""They come, they go, things I collect,"" sings Darcy Conroy, whose vocals appear often here, both in French and English. ""Gathered en masse, spilled from the drawers, estimating the past."" It's an image echoed both by Excerpts' cluttered cover art as well as the overarching concept Alary threads throughout the record. As he and Conroy conclude warring spoken word passages at this song's jarring midpoint, it finds a new melodic thread to carry it home, the very same that Alary recycles for the title track's bedrock in the album's second half. It's a clever attempt attempt at what feels like musical deja vu. Alary designed Excerpts to feature a host of trapdoors and moving walls that connect to one another both conceptually and musically. The glowing tympani of ""En attendant l'orage"" could very well be a link to the atonal needling and cinematic whoosh of ""Valse des objets trouves"". Or how about the strings of ""November 22nd"", which Alary writes to mimic the blare of Martin Horns, more commonly known as European sirens. Just as soon as that sound makes itself familiar, Alary pairs it with the real thing. There are instances like these smartly arranged throughout. Holistically, they combine to form an album that interacts with itself on a number of levels. While it brandishes a certain kind of insular brilliance, it's music more ripe for conversation or think pieces than headphones or the living room hi-fi.","Björk collaborator Olivier Alary marries elements of film score and classical music to more experimental avenues.

Passed Me By,Andy Stott,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2bc0084474cd0c1a15/1:1/w_160/88768950.jpg,2011-05-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/,Modern Love,"Exuberance is dance music's usual purview: ecstasy, adrenaline, abandon without end. But there's a whole subset of club music that dedicates itself to the inverse of what we're expected to seek amidst a sweating, heaving crowd-- loneliness, terror, misery, dread. This isn't a new phenomenon; Simon Reynolds has written of how the collective serotonin depletion that followed Britain's acid house effusions turned breakbeat hardcore and drum 'n' bass down darker paths. That music, at least, continued to engage the body, as does its direct descendant, dubstep, thanks to breakneck tempos and spleen-crushing bass. Enter Andy Stott. The Manchester-based DJ and producer is no stranger to dance music of the most visceral kind. In the latter half of the 2000s, he was best known for steely, speaker-destroying dub techno. Recently, especially under the pseudonym Andrea, he's tried his hand at shuddering, breakbeat-fueled dubstep and 160-BPM juke. But on a new album for Modern Love, he reinterprets techno in dirge-like fashion, slowed to a funereal shuffle and weighted down by a lead blanket of reverb. The term ""death disco"" has never felt so apt. It's a modest album, just six tracks and a short, introductory sketch-- some 33 minutes in total. It's the tempos that you notice first: his 4/4 thump moves sluggishly, like a 12"" 45 spun at 33 or even slower. House and techno usually lope along at somewhere between 120 and 130 beats per minute; Stott paces his tracks at 100, 90, even 80 BPM. Forget ""peak-time"" club music: these are trough-time beats. And it's not just a question of speed; every sound is warbly and unstable, like a warped record pitched way, way down. Handclaps and hi-hats crumble into bit-crushed detritus; kick drums and bass frequencies turn to a jellied slush, like solid ground liquefies during earthquakes. The murky sonics often recall Philip Jeck, who uses vintage turntables with a 16-RPM setting to attain an otherworldly rumble. On a couple of tracks, ethereal female vocals float hazily over the top; ""Execution"" is suffused with a gravelly death gurgle that wouldn't be out of place on a Sunn O))) record. A pervasive hiss and crackle drives home the idea that we're trawling the depths of vinyl's pockmarked grooves, like one of those microscopic photos that turns a record into a lunar landscape. Dissonance makes it even more hair-raising. ""North to South"" plunges darkly careening tones-- a Doppler-effect buzz with the skid of braked vinyl-- through bright, queasy synthesizers. (Kompakt fans may hear an echo of Wolfgang Voigt's M:I:5 project.) ""Intermittent"" revels in the seams as it patches together strings, bells, and vocal fragments into a rough-cut collage. In the song's last few bars, you can hear Stott's debt to disco edits as he finally lets a tightly cropped loop unfurl into a full phrase of music that, sped up, is recognizable as 90s R&B. Only one track doesn't fit the mold: ""Dark Details"", which throbs at dubstep's quickened pulse. Still, even here, the percussion's muted clang gives the impression of hearing a rave piped in via plumbing-- some club, miles away, suddenly bubbling up from your sink, and stinking of muck. Like a counterbalance to its uncharacteristically spry tempo, ""Dark Details"" is followed by the slowest tracks on the album, the demonic ""Execution"" and the torpid ""Passed Me By"", a song so bleak it could make Burial look optimistic by comparison. Ah yes, Burial: you couldn't not mention him, really. Burial's haunted melancholy certainly paved the way for Stott's even more despondent take on dance music, and Stott is hardly alone in his doomsayer's approach. You can hear similar sounds and affect in Shackleton, Raime, Holy Other, and in moments of Demdike Stare, a project of Stott's label-mate Miles Whittaker. But where Burial and Shackleton use the flickering syncopations of dubstep and garage to keep their music moving, Stott's 4/4 beats, reduced to a deathly crawl, give his music an even more hopeless cast. ""Drag,"" the name associated with Salem's style of music, would be apropos-- suggestive, as it is, of a body being towed, or a boulder pushed uphill. Where club culture mythologizes a circuit of endless nights and after-parties, Passed Me By suggests physical and spiritual exhaustion, Sisyphus collapsing beneath the dead-eyed twinkle of the disco ball.","The Manchester-based producer who shares a label and an M.O. with Demdike Stare turns dance music exuberance into feelings of loneliness and dread.

Her Favorite Colo(u)r,Blu,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1e9d034d5c69bf4675/1:1/w_160/cfd42110.jpg,2011-05-19 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15429-her-favorite-colour/,Nature Sounds,"Blu seems like the kind of rapper who's really proud of his DVD collection. I don't say this with any condescension or surprise; cinephilia might as well have supplanted graffiti or b-boying as one of hip-hop's four elements by the time Rae asked Meth where his Killer tape was. But it's clear from all the carefully assembled dialogue clips on Her Favorite Colo(u)r that Blu's interest in movies is just as personal as his ear for neo-backpack production and vibrant everyman-narrative rap. We get clips from Closer, Punch-Drunk Love, Buffalo '66, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou-- indie-canon stuff rearranged into a pastiche of troubled romance and teeth-gritting soul-baring. If there's a nerdcore for people who collect Criterion editions, Blu might've dropped its most essential release of the past couple of years. Catch is, you have to go back those ""past couple of years"" to pinpoint when it was first released. Her Favorite Colo(u)r used to be a free mixtape back in 2009. Now it's an official release that costs the same as any other album you can get via online retailers. It can be dicey to run across an album on the pay-actual-money market a couple of years after it was offered as a no-charge download, and it might be even dicier when the main selling point-- an ostensible ""remaster""-- threatens to defeat the purpose of the original article's charm. But reissue or not, this is the first widely available full-length Blu album to hit stores since he had a couple of great guest verses on the Roots' How I Got Over, and momentum's momentum even if he's advanced a bit stylistically in the two-plus years since this first dropped. If this release feels a little slight, you could blame its EP length-- roughly 30 minutes. But a more identifiable culprit is Blu as he sounds on the mic-- or under it, or across the room from it, or wherever he is in relation to the mic that half-buries him beneath his own production. Exile collab Below the Heavens and his Mainframe teamup as Johnson&Jonson have proven how engaging he can be at length, spinning narratives where he duels with his own worst personal impulses and pits them against more ground-level, day-to-day concerns. But he doesn't assert himself much here, letting the sampled dialogue pick up the slack between rushed verses and a backgrounded mic presence. Cuts like ""Amnesia"" and ""Since"" have an introspective quality to them, but that does make them a bit less immediate. And if rap is all about performance trumping the page, Blu's lyrics here have the unfortunate tendency to scan a lot better on paper, though at worst that usually just means you'll need another few attentive listens to start catching the highlights. At least the production does its best to make that task worthwhile. Aside from the whole Sundance vibe, the main draw of Her Favorite Colo(u)r is its dusty, lived-in feel, familiar loops of Billie Holiday and Jimi Hendrix and Curtis Mayfield worn threadbare and distorted into shitty-speaker resonance. And the remaster doesn't radically alter the album's original character for bad or good-- the bass is a bit crisper and richer, but the lo-fi dying-transistor/janky phonograph atmospherics of his production still register the most vividly. It's not the most revolutionary stuff; these dusty soul loops and chopped-up vocal refrains aren't as timely (or as polarizing) as the junglist Galaga headrush of Flying Lotus' beat for Blu's recent single ""Everything's OK"". But the lovesick noir vibe is compelling in the right mindset-- maybe humidity, alcohol, and regret are crucial prerequisites to getting the most out of it, but hip-hop production hasn't nailed the feel of scratched Formica bar-tops and dingy jukeboxes this well since the more reflective moments of Madvillainy. Cop this if you haven't, revisit it if you have, and consider it the Super 8 short-subject prequel to what should hopefully be a widescreen feature-length future breakthrough.","Once a free mixtape, the indie hip-hop mainstay's latest-- with a nice dusty, lived-in feel-- is now an official release.

Director's Cut,Kate Bush,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af37c0084474cd0c1a29/1:1/w_160/0ca683dd.jpg,2011-05-19 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15448-directors-cut/,EMIFish People,"This is not, strictly speaking, a new Kate Bush album. Just a warning for all of you who'd gotten used to agonizingly long waits between Bush records. It was easy to hope, when Director's Cut was first announced, that we'd been blessed ahead of schedule with the latest transmission from her private art-rock fairy land. Instead, this is a rethink of a somewhat controversial period in her career, by an artist who claims not to give much thought to her albums once they've been sent to market. Director's Cut transforms songs from 1989's The Sensual World and 1993's The Red Shoes. Sometimes crucial elements (rhythm tracks, vocals) are re-recorded. Some aspects (like certain guest performances) are left unchanged. Occasionally an entire song gets a note-by-note remake. It's a major and unexpected reinvention of familiar and very time-bound material, not quite ""new"" and also not quite what fans have been playing for years now. The very different mix of Director's Cut changes not just the sound but the emotional kick inside many of these songs. What was once the work of a shy woman who came to roaring life on record is now just as often subdued, reflective, inward-looking. It's worthy of standing as its own entry in Bush's discography, without necessarily replacing the albums it draws from. At the time of its release, The Sensual World seemed both up to date and not of its time. The glossy studio-obsessive production sounded definitely of its moment, fitting for the era of booming drums and reverb-soaked pop trifles from bands like Fine Young Cannibals and INXS. But the songs, and Bush's performances, were stark reminders that she actually came out of the same tradition that gave us the operatic vocals of prog rock, the jazz-tinged complexity of the Canterbury psychedelic scene, the unashamed theatricality that led to Peter Gabriel dressing up like a giant daffodil. It made for a strange hybrid, the smoothness of the Big 80s meets the complexity and expressionism of the prog 70s. Much of the record's tension came from wrapping shiny pop accessibility around songs that might burst into emotionally raw strangeness at any time. Bush played to the moment, but couldn't be contained by it. By the time of The Red Shoes-- with its prog structures, guest-star guitar heroics, world music touches, all given another dose of pop polish-- Bush's music was too ornate to fit in with the stripped-down ""realness"" of alt-rock. It was also still too defiantly individual to sit alongside the work of her 70s and 80s peers, many of whom had moved into comfortable, profitable, and bland MOR singer-songwriter territory. Her moment hadn't so much passed-- though it'd be hard to point out anyone else making music that sounded like this at the time-- as she'd become a genre-of-one. The fussed-over textures and genteel folk touches of adult contemporary peeled back mid-song to reveal naked eroticism, rage, joy, Bush's voice spluttering out wordless weirdness or leaping into ecstatic ululations. What Bush has done on Director's Cut, put simply, is to strip the 80s from these songs. (That goes for the Red Shoes material, too, even though the album was released in the 90s.) The gigantic drums and digital polish, what both dated the music instantly and gave it that stark contrast between accessibility and the deeply personal, have been replaced with less showy rhythm tracks, and a warmer, more intimate atmosphere. On the original ""The Sensual World"", the elements drawn from Celtic folk felt like striking intrusions in an all-digital world. Renamed ""Flower of the Mountain"" here, those rustic elements no longer feel quite so out of place, whether you found the original an intriguing hybrid or an awkward merger of old and new. The songs still don't have the feel of a band playing together, but they have a new unity, even the synthetic elements part of a lovingly handcrafted sound. ""The Red Shoes"", another Celtic-inflected standout, with one of Bush's wildest performances, gains a new intensity precisely because the instruments no longer feel so sterile. But not every element of this patchwork has been pieced together perfectly. The eerie keyboard textures on ""And So Love Is"", the kind of sour 80s kitsch beloved by Gang Gang Dance, seem surprisingly natural in this new environment. But Eric Clapton's bluesy wanking sounds even more out of place now, stadium pop bluster in a homemade world. It produces tension for sure, but the wrong sort. It's the singing that just as often startles, though. Bush is less show-offy on Director's Cut than any of her pre-hiatus albums. For a woman known for her range, and her fearlessness at using that range, her performances are always tempered and often low-key here. As with so many songs on Director's Cut, ""This Woman's Work"" becomes almost shocking in its difference, not least because it's transformed from one of Bush's biggest showstoppers into something far more mournful, the singer restraining herself as if almost but not quite broken by love. The backing track is just as minimal, but deeper, the instrumental textures less brittle. A hushed, lonely Bush sounds as if she's drifting through a vast, lonely space. But instead of the original's childlike verses surging to grown-ass-woman longing on the choruses, Bush is more evenly paced here, communicating deep regret more through a bereft tone than diva theatrics. It's desolate and intimate, like much of Director's Cut, where the original's bravura made it feel both tender and defiant, like much of Bush's early work. Even with an older and more reserved Bush occasionally putting the brakes on that melodrama, these reworked songs don't totally relinquish that unashamed grandiosity that makes Bush such a love-hate proposition. Director's Cut provides a unique opportunity to do an A/B comparison between a late-career artist and her younger self. But which you'll prefer likely depends on whether you favor a more assured artist working within her strengths, or a brash younger artist delighting in the defying of pop conventions.","The art-rocker reworks songs from The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, offering a rethink of a somewhat controversial period in her career.

Go With Me,Seapony,by: Martin Douglas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0c5e6ef95969321d36/1:1/w_160/ddacc625.jpg,2011-05-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15412-go-with-me/,Hardly Art,"Simplicity is arguably one of the most important virtues of indie pop, and one that Seattle's Seapony take to heart on Go With Me: 12 songs in 34 minutes, all written in major keys. Pillowy guitars (courtesy of Danny Rowland), humble basslines (Ian Brewer), and airy vocals (Jen Weidl) all float calmly over uncomplicated drum machine beats. Light touches of fuzz and reverb give it an overcast feeling, making this summer record sound weirdly autumnal. Go With Me is filled with childlike melancholy and wonderment, like a lot of twee records. But ultimately, it leaves you to wonder what Seapony are actually contributing to the vast expanse of bands clutching Tiger Trap 45s and portable button makers. The album starts on the right foot with ""Dreaming"", a jaunty, infectious tune with a spiky guitar line and a simple-yet-irresistible vocal melody from Weidl. ""Into the Sea""'s easygoing surf-rock is punctuated by handclaps and a nimble-fingered arpeggio. ""I Never Would"" goes a long way with its permeating sense of wistful nostalgia. If Go With Me were an EP with just those three songs, it would possess a great deal more replay value. Go With Me makes for wonderful background music, but paying closer attention reveals its inherent flaws. The sameness of the songs causes them to bleed into each other, never deviating from the same verse-chorus-verse template. This wouldn't particularly be a problem if the album weren't so safe, if its pleasant happiness or pleasant sadness were disrupted by a more excitable sense of emotion. Weidl delivers the lyrics with the same wispy soprano on every song. It doesn't help that those words aren't very interesting. Injecting simplicity into pop songwriting isn't always a clichéd effort-- take Girls' ""Laura"", for instance-- but banalities like ""Blue Star""'s opening couplet, ""You sat by me/ You sat down by the sea,"" sully an otherwise decent song, and the chorus of ""So Low"" (""I miss you every day/ I wish you'd stay"") makes Rebecca Black look like Dan Bejar. The best indie pop always finds a way to marry a sense of individuality to its jangle and bounce-- the violent noise underscoring Black Tambourine's output, or the literary flair and sometimes-subversive humor that marks Belle and Sebastian's. Think about the heart-wrenching, lacerating sadness of the Softies, or even the confrontational cuteness of Tullycraft. Unfortunately, the vanilla innocuousness of Seapony loses them in the shuffle. This is not to say they have delivered an utterly charmless album. If your anorak pockets are stuffed with indie pop show flyers, or you are a daily reader of Skatterbrain, Go With Me has a place in your record collection. But until they can really stand out from the crowd, Seapony just come across as garden-variety twee.","Seattle trio crafts a record filled with childlike melancholy and wonderment that nonetheless comes off as garden-variety twee.

Collected By Itself: 2006 to 2009,Blank Dogs,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af165e6ef95969321d4b/1:1/w_160/d9c51eba.jpg,2011-05-18 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15422-collected-by-itself-2006-to-2009/,Captured Tracks,"When one-man Brooklyn band Blank Dogs debuted a few years back, many listeners thought Mike Sniper's distorted, minimalist synth-rock represented the tail end of the era's fascination with early-1980s UK post-punk. With time, and a big general shift within indie rock, Blank Dogs actually turned out to be one of the first, and rather prescient, examples of the new lo-fi generation at work. Blank Dogs wasn't a cheap off-the-cuff take on the full-bodied (and pristinely recorded) dance-punk sound of the DFA. He was a purposefully stripped-down tribute to the first wave of bands that turned thrifty bedroom recording into a badge of honor. Heard in 2011, the grab bag of singles and random early tunes collated on Collected By Itself sounds less like the work of an indie outlier and more like the (retro-minded) Sound of Right Now. True, Collected By Itself may not share many obvious sonic reference points with, say, Best Coast. But like the sun-and-fun wing of lo-fi, Collected defiantly foregrounds its fuzzed-out homemade qualities. It's just that everything sounds claustrophobic, rather than warm and inviting, with all the dynamic qualities of ""real"" rock squashed into a grimy mid-range blare. As David Raposa pointed out in his review of Blank Dogs' last proper album, 2010's Land and Fixed, this was very much intentional. Sniper chose to pay homage to a sound that reveled in murk and grime and gothic menace, and so why wouldn't his music sound like this? Though recent Blank Dogs records have grown brighter, their hooks more distinct, it's hard to imagine the songs on Collected being improved by cleaning them up for mass consumption. The chilly and muted vibe is a big part of the record's appeal, as it was for the records he draws from. The muffled machine drums and fried-sounding synthesizers on Collected By Itself are often a dead-ringer for ""Nag Nag Nag""-era Cabaret Voltaire, and Sniper seems to have a similar conflicted relationship to pop as the early Cabs. These aren't dirges, and Sniper does have a weird knack for memorable choruses. But a tune like ""Waiting"", a ramshackle guitar stomper not a million miles from the current crop of San Francisco garage bands, is still a rarity. The bulk of Collected is propelled by Peter Hook bass lines throbbing weakly along and some squiggles of sour keyboard noise. Sniper's droning voice occasionally bears a resemblance to the late Jay Reatard in Anglophile mode, but usually stripped of any intensity, the choruses driven home by their nagging repetition rather than any sort of pop ecstasy. In other words, as you might guess given the limited-edition nature of these songs on their original releases, it's not for everyone, especially in 27-song hour-plus bulk. If the gray and eerie world conjured by the grottier members of the original Rough Trade crew appeals, and you've never delved into Blank Dogs' ample discography before, then Collected might be for you. For everyone else, a little dose of this drizzly dourness will probably do you.","Once the work of an indie outlier, this collection of Mike Sniper's distorted, minimalist synth-rock is more like the (retro-minded) Sound of Right Now.

Street of the Love of Days,Amor De Días,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af35c0084474cd0c1a23/1:1/w_160/44a907a7.jpg,2011-05-18 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15446-street-of-the-love-of-days/,Merge,"Amor De Días is a collaboration between the Clientele's Alasdair MacLean and Lupe Núñez-Fernández, a Spanish vocalist who has spent the past decade performing as one half of indie pop duo Pipas. Street of the Love of Days is a full-length affair they've been sculpting together in London, ""in secret,"" since 2008, bringing in other notable musicians to flesh out their pastoral, sometimes psychedelic chamber pop. Names include Damon and Naomi, Gary Olson of Ladybug Transistor, and Louis Philippe. There's isn't much in the way of clues as to why they wrote and recorded in secret, but this, their debut, sounds like an album that wasn't yet ready to be heard. It is beautifully crafted and rich in demure detail, but Street of the Love of Days is largely bereft of energy or direction. It begins and ends very quietly. ""Foxes"" is a tip-toeing bookend whose arrangement includes harp, strings, and delicate melodic lead on Greek bouzouki. As she does in the bossa nova of ""Late Mornings"", Núñez-Fernández delivers her vocals here in Spanish whispers, all of which dovetail nicely with the gentle sonics at play. That sets the tone for the rest of the record. While her harmonies are top-notch at times (as they are in the appropriately autumnal lilt of a re-work of the Clientele's ""Harvest Time""), Núñez-Fernández's vocal performance rarely hold forth. Similarly, when performing his share of the vocal duties, MacLean rarely applies his voice in a way that elevates a song. Those compositions that clearly bear his influence sound similarly muted. ""Wild Winter Trees"" is a strummed watercolor that could have been (might be) a Clientele castaway, but its sub-two-minute length suggests sketch more than anything else. As a whole, the lion's share of this record tends to feel the same way: a collection of 15 wide-ranging wallpaper sketches rolled out over 42 minutes. For fans of MacLean's work in the Clientele, this may prove to be a serious letdown. Both his voice and songwriting gifts make themselves heard in a standout like ""House of Flint"", but very little here proves to be as dynamic or memorable as the rest of his catalogue. That owes more to the issue that these songs seem far too unfocused to be amplified. In fact, Pipas is a band just as rooted in the 1960s as MacLean's main songwriting outfit. And together they make a great pair, the smooth textures of their voices a natural fit. But whether they're swaying through Brazilian music or trying British folk, what's most clear is that right now their music shoots to set a mood more than anything else.","The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean and Pipas' Lupe Núñez-Fernández combine for an LP of pastoral, sometimes psychedelic chamber pop.

Rock & Roll Submarine,Urge Overkill,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af349d034d5c69bf4695/1:1/w_160/91c4be67.jpg,2011-05-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15440-rock-roll-submarine/,UO,"For some, Urge Overkill earned their place in history as gadflies in Chicago's indie rock scene during the turn of the 1990s-- releasing LPs on Touch and Go, coining the term ""Guyville,"" being on the receiving end of Steve Albini's most withering insults. But then, their masterful 1993 sellout bid Saturation proved that their true talents were wasted on indie rock's ideals. As the opening act on both the era-defining Vs. and Nevermind tours, UO incongruously embraced the pursuit of fame and groupies. They rocked leisure suits, wore dinner-plate logo medallions, and crafted ostentatious Cheap Trick hooks. Much like the Hives or the Darkness a decade later, many wondered, ""Do they really mean it?"" but their stylized image was less cynical branding than a necessary multimedia confluence. Their music simply wouldn't have been convincing coming from guys in jeans and t-shirts. Unfortunately, the bummed burnout of the underrated 1995 album Exit the Dragon proved prophetic, and it was the last thing we'd hear from them until now. That was 16 years ago. Unlike Windy City lightning rods Liz Phair and Billy Corgan, Urge can essentially show up in 2011 as if nothing happened in the interim, their legacy almost completely unaffected one way or the other. And Rock & Roll Submarine finds them sounding like themselves, which is refreshing if only because no one else does. Nash Kato once sang, ""only booze improves with age,"" on all-time tearjerker ""View of the Rain"", but as vocalists, he and King Roeser come off the rack perfectly intact. And while the studio session lifers taking over the rhythm section surely lack the Q rating drummer Blackie Onassis brought to the table, in terms of sheer musicianship, he was replaceable. In a surprising move for a band that always made space for in-jokes and grand self-mythology, Rock & Roll Submarine makes no reference whatsoever to the hiatus or gives any indication that the decade and a half was spent fussing over the material or anticipating a kingmaking comeback. Though of a much higher fidelity than their T&G releases, Submarine charges head-down with one-take immediacy, lean and strictly business. It's workmanlike and yet unlabored, with most tracks clocking under three and a half minutes and little thought given to overdubs, solos, or their often affecting acoustic side. Still, Submarine is saddled with an uncharacteristic lack of flair both lyrically and musically. Strip away goofy set pieces like ""The Candidate"" and ""Erica Kane"" and the swaggering ""Sister Havana"", and Urge too convincingly dress down to blue-collar classic rockers-- strong character actors without much material to work with. It's hard not to wish that more was at stake. Even something as seemingly obvious as the barely metaphoric ""She's My Ride"" can't really commit itself to a properly horndog premise. If it's any consolation, the songs are interchangeable and accomplished enough that long-time fans will be relieved that they didn't embarrass themselves. Newcomers, if any, will almost certainly wonder what the big deal was. Which is a shame. Last year's re-emergence of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a band similarly derided as ironists during the 90s, felt like it could've set the table for Urge to prove that indie rock's attitudes toward showmanship have hardly changed in the past 20 years. Rock & Roll Submarine is a reminder to thank Nash and King for the memories, but as an album, it seems unlikely to inspire new ones.","Sixteen years after their last full-length release, Chicago's Urge Overkill return with a new album and a fuzzy sense of purpose.

Turtleneck & Chain,The Lonely Island,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2cb1335d7bf1699ed4/1:1/w_160/3aaca3a0.jpg,2011-05-18 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15443-turtleneck-chain/,Universal Republic,"When the Lonely Island's parodic viral rap anthem ""I'm on a Boat"" snagged a Grammy nomination in 2009, guest singer T-Pain expressed a bit of confusion: This thing was a lark, a skit for ""Saturday Night Live"" and (maybe more to the point) for YouTube, and here it is, getting one of the highest honors T-Pain will probably ever get. In ""We're Back!"", the opening track of their sophomore album, Turtleneck & Chain, Lonely Island member Jorma Taccone points out how weird that was: ""Lonely Island! Grammy nominated!""-- this right after Andy Samberg raps about how his dick looks like ""the fat that you cut off a steak."" ""We're Back!"" is an absurd, overblown take on the intro to every self-aggrandizing blockbuster rap album ever, but Turtleneck & Chain could well outsell plenty of the stuff it spoofs. Ridiculous as it may be, these guys are now something resembling pop stars. And no 2011 album has a list of guests as star-studded as this one: Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Akon. They may be fake rappers, but real rappers don't have that kind of pull anymore. And since they're pop stars now, the Lonely Island face a familiar problem on Turtleneck & Chain: How do you follow up a big debut album without just repeating all the same tricks? These guys are, after all, ""Saturday Night Live"" employees, and repeating tricks is what ""Saturday Night Live"" does. Turtleneck & Chain brings back a few characters from debut album Incredibad: Shy Ronnie, the ""Dick in the Box"" guys. And, for the most part, it recycles what made Incredibad work. The Lonely Island guys make jokes out of rap music but do it without mocking the genre, putting lifetimes of fandom in service of absurdist jokes that get progressively more absurd as the songs go on, bringing their superstar guests along for the ride. Michael Bolton, for instance, just kills his bit on ""Jack Sparrow"", wailing his absurdly catchy dorked-out movie-fan chorus and refusing to let the Lonely Island people stick with their boring club jam. Lesser comics would've just made fun of Michael Bolton's past; on this album, he actually gets something to do. Of course, ""Jack Sparrow"" had a funny-as-hell video on ""Saturday Night Live"", and it doesn't play as well without its visuals. That's a problem here. Of the tracks that already appeared on ""SNL"", some of them work just fine on their own, like the infectiously joyous Akon collab ""I Just Had Sex"" or ""Threw It on the Ground"", a devastating but affectionate skewering of Dead Prez/Immortal Technique-style conspiracy-theory rap. Others, like ""Shy Ronnie 2: Ronnie & Clyde"", are visual jokes that just don't make any sense without their videos, though it definitely helps that a DVD of those videos comes with the CD. The non-TV tracks generally don't hold up as well, but it's fun to match them up with their inspirations. ""Rocky"", for example, pushes the already-jokey premise of DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's ""I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson"" to gory extremes, and ""Trouble on Dookie Island"" turns the breathless crime narrative of something like Ghostface Killah's ""Shakey Dog"" into a gross-out joke by having its desperate thug narrators shit themselves over and over and over. Throughout Turtleneck & Chain, the Lonely Island play around way more with dick and shit jokes than they did on their first album-- and for a group whose first massive success already had the word ""dick"" in its title, that's saying something. Some of it is absolutely terrible; the ""Falcor vs. Atreyu"" skit, in which Neverending Story characters fuck each other, is obnoxious enough to clear out a room at a Wolf Eyes show, and the intentionally annoying ""Japan"" hits its mark a little too well. For the most part, though, these are good songs with jokes in them, not jokes with songs attached. An album full of fake rap, famous-people cameos, and scatological jokes shouldn't have any replay value whatsoever, but Turtleneck & Chain holds up awfully well, partly because the music is almost always, at the very least, listenable, and partly because the jokes depend more on earwormy hooks and absurdities spinning out of control than on simple punchlines. The guest stars here all give some indication of why they're stars; Nicki Minaj's verse on ""The Creep"", for example, is just a great Nicki guest verse. (The Lonely Island guys themselves don't rap or sing anywhere near as well as their guests, but they're sketch comics and writers, not pop stars, so we can cut them some slack.) And even if these songs work best as ""SNL"" sketches, they should still work nicely on your next road trip.","What started as ""Saturday Night Live"" spoofs has now made Andy Samberg & co. into pop stars. Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, and Nicki Minaj guest.

Innings,Nodzzz,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af089d034d5c69bf464d/1:1/w_160/45d584cd.jpg,2011-05-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15408-innings/,Woodsist,"When they released their 2008 debut, San Francisco trio Nodzzz were just one of many jangly, lo-fi guitar acts making waves. As Pitchfork's Joe Colly noted at the time, there was a chance they'd ""face similar (and probably misguided) backlash-driven criticism"" that would eventually befall similar cool-cred-chasing bands. But Nodzzz, quite oppositely, couldn't have been any less cool-- childlike, clear-eyed, and at times off-puttingly cheery, their geeky earnestness set them apart, and no amount of tape crust could hide it. Suffice it to say, if you liked Nodzzz, there's no possible way you won't like Innings, a follow-up that often proves almost indistinguishable from its predecessor. Still adhering to the same I-don't-wanna-grow-up mentality and sprightly, brief songs, the band's motto remains the same, paraphrased pointedly on ""True to Life"": ""If you must make a picture, it should be true to life."" After all, the record is called Innings because co-songwriters Anthony Atlas and Sean Paul Presley spent their formative years playing baseball together. Opener ""Always Make Your Bed"" uses a simple chore to frame the idea of retreating home when the world beats you down. ""(Low) Energy"" seems to be about needing a cup of coffee. So yes, Nodzzz keep it simple and short (14 tracks at 23 minutes), and don't seem too interested in switching things up, which is fine: Their aloofness is a big part of the draw. What has changed is the address, as Nodzzz are now a part of the Woodsist roster. After playing with Woods and Real Estate last year, the link-up seemed inevitable. Besides, if there's one band that Nodzzz share a true kinship with, it's Woods. The production has also been cleaned up a little, leaving room for some excellent little guitar tricks that feel properly spotlit, not showoff-y (dudes don't do ""showoff-y""). Nodzzz songs are categorically repetitive to the point of homogeneity, so these little moments-- the weird tunings on ""Time (What's It Going To Do?)"", the riffed-out ""Troubled Times""-- all display welcome finesse. Which isn't to say their whole affable, Muppet-like bop can't get on your nerves. But for every silly dud (""Ye Olde Indian Towne""), there's something like ""Heyday Past Heyday Due"", a rare minor-key track about the realization that life's party might be winding down. Innings might not be your cup of tea, but there's little denying its charm-- as Atlas and Presley suggest, ""If it don't got soul or spirit, no one will come near it."" Which is clearly not something they need to worry about.","San Francisco trio moves to Woodsist but maintains the same style of sprightly, brief songs explored on its debut.

Laced,Psychedelic Horseshit,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1aea9e61561daa63bb/1:1/w_160/cfa772d0.jpg,2011-05-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15425-laced/,Fat Cat,"So many bands have recently taken steps away from their lo-fi roots-- Ariel Pink, Vivian Girls, Times New Viking-- that tape-hiss diehards probably wonder if anyone will actually stick to their scuzzy guns. Those fearful might look to self-proclaimed ""shitgazers"" Psychedelic Horseshit as the last line of defense. If even these snotty shamblers are willing to wipe their noses and tuck in their shirts, then maybe lo-fi is just this generation's musical training wheels. Sure enough, if you drag your needle quickly across Laced, you'll probably think this Ohio band (now a duo) has cleaned up its act. There's less guitar muck, less maxed-out tape noise, and fewer moments of impenetrable chaos. But that doesn't mean the music is any clearer. These 11 songs are just as weird and demented as those that came before, maybe even more. The weirdness just comes from different sources now-- bouncy electronic beats, playfully psychotic synths, and Matt Horseshit's hypnotic voice, which has melted from brash and bratty down to stoned and endearingly subdued, even if it still sounds like it's pouring out of his nose. All of which makes this edition of Psychedelic Horseshit more immediately enjoyable, whether or not you dug them before. To be fair, it's not a drastic turn-- 2009's Shitgaze Anthems was also pretty upbeat and relatively clean. But Laced takes those qualities to a new level, one filled with memorable melodies, bright atmospheres, and tons of sonic exploration. When things do get cacophonous, as in the overlapping drum stomps of the Black Dice-meets-Excepter ""I Hate the Beach"", it's more about epiphany than obscurity. That's also the case with Horseshit's vocals and lyrics which, as he rightly noted, ""are more dreamlike. There's not a lot of pointed 'fuck this' and 'fuck that.' I got sick of that stuff."" Not too sick, though. The band's notorious Wavves-bashing still shows up on Laced, albeit more subtly. It's hard not to see the title ""I Hate the Beach"" as a veiled jab at both Nathan Williams and beach-obsessed chillwave. Same goes for the anti-summer lyrics of ""Tropical Vision"", which begins with the couplet, ""I don't need no waves/ Don't need no palm trees swaying."" But Psychedelic Horseshit aren't just tearing things down, they're building something unique out of the rubble. The best example is the title track, whose wavy synth glitter, computerized rattle, and Royal Trux-ish sing-speak form a bafflingly catchy hook, like a sculpture chiseled from scrap metal. It's a smart self-revision-- Horseshit and partner Ryan Jewell are hacking at themselves as much as their supposed rivals. As Horseshit put it, ""Sometimes you gotta cut the tree down to make it bigger."" Laced is indeed bigger and bolder than previous albums, which is somewhat ironic since it has a more intimate, made-in-the-bedroom feel than the band's earlier basement forays. And its rangy invention points to a wider future for an act whose schtick could've gotten stuck in a static cul de sac. That's not because this album is cleaner or that lo-fi is larval skin to be shed. Psychedelic Horseshit might next get more lo-fi or more hi-fi, darker or poppier, better or worse. What I like most about Laced is it makes me excited to find out.","Now a duo, the self-proclaimed shitgaze band isn't just tearing things down, it's building something unique out of the rubble.

The Double Cross,Sloan,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0513d197565213a1ec/1:1/w_160/60002cb8.jpg,2011-05-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15407-the-double-cross/,Yep Roc,"The title of Sloan's new album is an oblique reference to the band's age. The Double Cross = XX = 20, for the 20 years they've been a band, the same four guys making records and touring together, with all the attendant peaks and valleys of notoriety that come with that. They've been one of the world's great power pop bands that whole time-- hell, they've just been a great rock band-- and that's an oddly thankless achievement. They've never matched up with the flavor of the moment, or seemed to try to either, and it makes them easy to overlook, because people are always talking more loudly about something else. But they've made a lot of music with staying power, records stuffed with great songs that sound good any time. Go back and listen to Between the Bridges, Never Hear the End of It, or One Chord to Another. They haven't aged a day. And here, 20 years in, they've made one of their best albums to mark the occasion. It comes three years after their last album, which matches the longest gap of their career, and even with all that time between to work on new material, it's still their shortest full-length, topping out under 35 minutes (longer with the iTunes bonus tracks). That brevity and focus turns out to be an asset, though-- there is no fat at all on the album, and every song is lasered into the shape that gives it the biggest impact. Four last less than two minutes and five seconds, and yet nothing feels slight or too short. Part of the reason for that is that the album is expertly assembled to work as a seamless whole, much like Between the Bridges and Never Hear the End of It were. It's not a random collection of songs they happened to have around. ""Beverley Terrace"" reprises ""Shadow of Love"", and there are other call-backs on the album, not to mention the fact that songs are sequenced so that opening and closing tempos match up, and even the key changes sound good as one song turns into another. The band has also worked hard to broaden its sound. This is the lushest Sloan album, with several keyboard-driven tracks and a couple of heart-stopping ballads to give it a more varied landscape. Though it's clearly structured to flow as an album and function as an absorbing start-to-finish listen, The Double Cross is still the kind of record that makes you want to talk about every song individually. Nearly any of them could work as a single. ""The Answer Was You"" is built around what sounds sort of like a Mellotron flute figure, with a hint of disco lurking in its rhythm guitar part. ""Laying So Low"" is the slow closer; it opens like an after-hours drag but quickly blossoms into something stirring. On ""Your Daddy Will Do"", Sloan, possibly by accident, manage to sort of diagnose the reason they're still making great rock records even though they've never been in fashion doing it: ""They kind of lost touch with what's in and who's who."" ""Unkind"" is the sort of stomping power pop tune that made them hitmakers on their Canadian home turf. As great as all these songs are individually, they sound best together, and hearing them in relation to one another reveals things about them that are harder to catch when they're separated. That may seem paradoxical, but I don't think it is-- making this kind of record is a peculiar talent of this band. That they sound this creatively fresh this deep into their career is a real treat for people who've stuck with them through the years. If you've never given them a chance before, this is a great time to get to know them.","Twenty years in, these Canadians still know how to do power pop right, and this brief and varied LP is one of their best.

Roadkill Rising... The Bootleg Collection 1977-2009,Iggy Pop,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0dea9e61561daa639f/1:1/w_160/97edffd4.jpg,2011-05-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15414-roadkill-rising-the-bootleg-collection-1977-2009/,Shout! Factory,"For any other artist, the idea of issuing four discs of moldy live recordings-- particularly for a performer who's been anthologized a couple of times already-- would reek of the worst kind of barrel-scraping, fan-fleecing cash grab. But to summarize a career as unlikely as Iggy Pop's, it makes perfect sense. Despite the enduring import of his first three albums with the Stooges and mid-70s collaborations with David Bowie-- the influence of which can still be heard today in everyone from Fucked Up to LCD Soundsystem-- those albums tell only part of the story. The real reason why Iggy's been able to carve out a career for 40-plus years-- going from certain drug casualty to potential ""American Idol"" judge-- without the benefit of a platinum record is his magnetic charisma as a live performer. And long before YouTube allowed us to attend concerts vicariously, bootlegs played a crucial role in establishing that legend. Even without being able to see his wiry body slither across the stage, the seemingly bottomless supply of unauthorized Iggy concert recordings reified his incomparable talents for baiting a crowd, ad libbing, and rewriting ""Louie Louie"" with new lyrics more vulgar than the FBI could've ever imagined. At an Iggy show, what happens between the songs is just as entertaining and edifying as the songs themselves. This quality was first widely brought to light with the most (in)famous of Iggy-related bootlegs, Metallic K.O., a delirious document of the Raw Power-era Stooges' dying days (circa 1973-74) and Iggy at his self-destructive zenith, encouraging all manner of abuse (verbal or otherwise) from a bloodthirsty crowd. In contrast, Roadkill Rising is like the extended post-script to that moment, picking up the story in 1977, after Bowie had effectively brought Iggy back from the dead with the still-potent double-whammy of The Idiot and Lust For Life. The set devotes each of its four discs to performances from a specific decade, but even if you don't think Iggy has produced a front-to-back great album since 1979's New Values, Roadkill Rising is still worth your time. No matter what era, each disc is padded with period performances of Stooges and Bowie-era material and amusing cover-song desecrations (ranging from ""Hang on Sloopy"" to the ""Batman"" theme), while 80s/90s selections like ""Blah Blah Blah"" and ""Home"" hit with greater force when stripped of their dated productions. But more significantly, Roadkill Rising functions less as a simple overview of Iggy's post-Stooges career than an elaborate portrait of the first punk who had to grow up in public, and the difficult transition from self-mutilating spectacle into respectable artist. Early on, at a Detroit show from 1977, we hear Iggy trying mischievously to muscle his way into the classic-rock canon with a cover of Them's ""Gloria"", wherein he uses the famous refrain to spell out his own name. But later, at a particularly unruly Detroit gig from 1980-- the excerpts of which alone are worth the compilation's price tag-- we hear him paying the price for his own petulance: It takes Iggy no less than three tries to get through a subdued, smoky cover of the Sinatra standard ""One For My Baby (And One More For the Road)"", as he's forced to talk down an increasingly impatient crowd who'd rather he do away with the showtunes shtick and get back to ""Cock in My Pocket"". As Roadkill Rising traverses the 80s up through the 2000s, you can hear the audiences getting larger and more receptive to his whims, while Iggy becomes less concerned with antagonizing his audience than looking out for them; he cuts a 2003 performance of ""Dirt"" short to berate a bouncer for denying an over-eager fan's attempt to dance with him onstage. Inevitably, for a set that sprawls over four discs and 65 songs, Roadkill Rising is weighed down by blocks of inessential tracks from 1993's American Caesar and 2001's Beat Em Up, at the expense of including certified classics like ""I Got a Right"", ""Success"", ""I'm Bored"", and ""Fun House"" (the last of which is actually featured on the tracklist, but incorrectly so; it's really ""1970""). But even as it catalogs numerous changes in style, backing bands, and recording fidelity-- climaxing with selections from the Stooges' riotous 2007 reunion tour-- Roadkill Rising invariably succeeds in presenting an Iggy Pop gig as an exceedingly exciting place to be, where the line separating exhilaration and unrest is routinely blurred. And in the context of all that precedes it, the closing string of songs from Iggy's jazzy French-chanson experiment, Préliminaires-- complete with cordial, ""VH1 Storytellers""-style between-song banter-- feels less like the WTF left-turn it seemed upon release in 2009 and more like a well-deserved reprieve from spending the past four decades sating his audience's desire to see him open up and bleed.","Four-disc collection covering four decades of Iggy Pop's raucous live shows paints an elaborate portrait of an original punk.

Own Your Ghost,13 & God,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af225e6ef95969321d65/1:1/w_160/cd06cf30.jpg,2011-05-17 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15433-own-your-ghost/,AnticonAlien Transistor,"The unclassifiable band 13 & God was formed because of the mutual admiration between Themselves and the Notwist, and later came to include Anticon artists like Dax Pierson (Subtle) and Jordan Dalrymple (Antonionian). It's not hard to imagine what the American post-rap duo and the German electro-pop band saw in each other. Themselves created music of engrossing complexity, but had little aptitude for lucidity and directness. Meanwhile, the Notwist excelled at piercingly simple songs, but seemed to struggle with too many moving parts. Musically, all the two groups had in common were glitches, though Themselves' disturbances were strident while the Notwist's were silky and mild, and maybe that was the point. In combining their strengths, would they also compensate for each other's weaker areas? On 13 & God's 2005 debut, the answer was yes and no. It included some terrific songs, but most of them just sounded like the Notwist, or the Notwist with someone muttering to himself very rapidly in the background. The record didn't feel quite digested, and perhaps it just couldn't have-- the clean gauze of Markus Acher's voice and Adam ""Doseone"" Drucker's Micro Machines Man patter are virtually nuts and gum. That's still the case on the long-awaited second album, Own Your Ghost, where we're zipped back and forth between their contrasting sounds so hectically that it causes musical jet lag. It's still a neat project with many moments of interest, but it's disappointing that the second album doesn't cohere overall any better than the first. More than anything, it makes you wish for a new Notwist album. Because wow, there are some good Notwist songs here. The album starts on a high note with ""Its Own Sun"", one of those instantly gettable acoustic numbers that Acher does so well, which floats along amid softly coursing glitches and coos. It crashes into the hyperactively skittering ""Death Major"", whose fast-rap magic tricks seem to have scurried in from an entirely different album. And then, suddenly, we're listening to another lovely Notwist song, ""Armored Scarves"", where Acher sinks one of his trademarked cryptic-but-loaded refrains into a flatteringly warm and purring environment-- at least until Dose's helium-voiced sing-song takes over in the second half, blasting drum fills in tow. The dividedness of the record is especially plain here. Acher generally gets calm and luscious music, and then all hell breaks loose whenever Dose shows up. There isn't really much to say about the lyrics on this album-- for Acher, they're about bearing melody, and for Dose they're about dicing up space and time. Like the group's odd name, which apparently is a mysterious apostolic reference, the many words on this album feel like fervent (even messianic) messages being transmitted in a dense code that no one could hope to understand-- except for true detail-oriented obsessives, for whose diligent attentions Doseone's music is ideal. This microscopic way of listening is precisely the opposite of the dreamy semi-presence the Notwist inspire, and those two extremes clash here. At the musical level, the collaborative lines are much blurrier, and from the syrupy woodwinds and drippy ""Whisper Song"" bass of ""Janu Are"" to the warmly squealing naïve-pop of ""Oldage"", there are plenty of signs that these guys can make beautiful and coherent music together. If only they could find a way to make their two strong, sharply different vocalists sound as integrated and natural.","Latest from members of American post-rap duo Themselves and the German electro-pop band Notwist zips back and forth between their contrasting sounds.

Diaper Island,Chad VanGaalen,by: Hari Ashurst,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1fea9e61561daa63c9/1:1/w_160/bb4f6f1a.jpg,2011-05-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15428-diaper-island/,Sub Pop,"In addition to turning in three very solid albums of his own in the past few years, Chad VanGaalen also produced fellow Albertans Women. The two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic idiosyncrasies-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into VanGaalen's world rather than the other way around. So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth LP, Diaper Island. VanGaalen's previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to electronic synth workouts, and they often sound like grab-bags drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently told an interviewer he had recorded 80 songs leading up to this record). Part of what makes Diaper Island a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage. On Diaper Island VanGaalen internalizes feelings of restlessness into the fabric of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like Sonic Youth and Pavement loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. But the song's melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. It's a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that VanGaalen used to perform with production switches on previous records. But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as VanGaalen's excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels zig-zagging verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and VanGaalen allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""Blonde Hash"". The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. VanGaalen sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of VanGaalen's character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole. VanGaalen closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and Diaper Island-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm VanGaalen's status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer.","The Canadian singer/songwriter/producer turns in a more focused album with a sonic palette reminiscent of his recent production work for Women.

Feel It Break,Austra,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2413d197565213a220/1:1/w_160/48520386.jpg,2011-05-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15434-feel-it-break/,DominoPaper Bag,"On her own and under her own name, Katie Stelmanis used to record synthetic art-pop. This was tense and jarring music, music that jumped around and demanded attention. Austra, Stelmanis' new band, makes just as much use of her stretched-out yip and her theatrical instincts, but the music is a lot warmer and more comfortable. Austra play a warm, hazy sort of electro-goth. It's synthetic and repetitive, and there's plenty of Giorgio Moroder in its DNA, but it's not dance music. Instead, it's music for a planetarium, or maybe for a mid-1980s PBS science documentary. Austra's synth riffs don't pound or undulate; they flutter and envelop. And Stelmanis doesn't sing over the top of their tracks; she emits sound from somewhere in the thick of it. Feel It Break, Austra's debut album, is essentially made up of 11 minor variations on a single sound-- no complaint, since they're good at that one sound. It's tough to talk about Stelmanis' icy, high-pitched deadpan delivery without mentioning Kate Bush. By that same token, it's tough to talk about the band's music without mentioning Witching Hour-era Ladytron, or maybe Bat for Lashes. This is pretty and heady music, music that can subtly change the air in the room where it's playing. Drums lightly percolate rather than thud, and synth riffs hide inside each other like Russian nesting dolls, gradually revealing themselves over the course of entire songs. And the group builds these things patiently. Often, it holds back on introducing vocals or drums for more than a full minute, letting the songs' feel develop before making any radical changes. These songs aren't entirely alike. First single ""Beat and the Pulse"" has a telescoping sort of push-pull to it; it's the closest the band ever comes to genuine dance music, and even it doesn't come that close. On ""Lose It"", Stelmanis gets a chance to stretch her huge, tremulous voice over some minimally invasive synth backing, and she sounds titanic: ""Don't wanna loooooose ya."" The bouncy art-pop piano on ""Shoot the Water"" has a certain twitchiness, bringing Stelmanis partway back to her solo days. And closing tracks ""The Noise"" and ""The Beast"" do away with percussion entirely, letting Stelmanis sing over miasmic synth fog on the former and floridly ghostly piano on the latter. Even with those variations, though, Feel It Break still works as a monochromatic album, one content to stick with the same shade of glimmering darkness. Onstage at SXSW a couple of months ago, Austra cut a stark figure-- Stelmanis backed by two stunning, harmonizing twins, the rest of the band half-hidden at the back of the stage. Even playing in the middle of an absurdly sunny day, the band seemed to exist in some vague state of perpetual glamorous nighttime; that could've been them, not Bauhaus, serenading David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve during the great opening scene of Tony Scott's otherwise bullshit vampire movie, The Hunger. On Feel It Break, they've got that creeping cinematic synth-psych style down cold. Moving forward, I'm curious to hear what else they can do.","Latest in a line of goth-pop artists-- think Bat for Lashes or Zola Jesus-- to emerge in recent years issues a promising Domino debut.

Destroyed,Moby,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af289d034d5c69bf4680/1:1/w_160/a9145221.jpg,2011-05-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15437-destroyed/,MuteLittle Idiot,"What do people want from Moby? It's a question worth asking not just because of the lukewarm reputation he carries among many music fans but because Moby himself has spent so much time trying to answer it. The answer appears to be, resoundingly, ""not what you've been giving us,"" and I'll wager that it's not the ""innovative microsite"" or photo book that arrive concurrent to his latest album, Destroyed. Recorded as he toured, late at night and lonely, the record finds Moby sober and living in Los Angeles (nice digs). He still possesses that particularly 1990s strain of self-loathing that doubles as egoism (he's @thelittleidiot on Twitter), and he's probably two facial tics away from being a living, breathing David Lynch character. One of the disappointing things about Moby is that his records and ideas are very simple even when he thinks they're very complex. Moby is 45, wealthy, and has deep thoughts about religion and food and friendship, but his umpteenth album is ""a soundtrack for empty cities at 2 a.m."" (his words). Do you find dark urban environments stark and eerie? Does air travel make you lonely? Have you ever felt isolated even when you are physically surrounded by buildings and people? You're either dealing with these questions privately or you're Thom Yorke. This is fertile territory, though: Artists have been mining flickering desolation for decades. Moby's key error is that while he was inspired by these scenes, Destroyed is the type of low-stakes atmospheric mush that lounges and airports and bars play to make you forget where you are (on ""The Low Hum"" a female voice intones, ""Like a tourist in some strange hotel,"" moving on before she can get to ""...listening to Moby""). It plays like a facile representation of these beautiful/melancholy environs instead of an exploration of them. Moby still has only a few building blocks: sawing strings, hissy breakbeats, cantering pianos, dusty samples. He sings too, but thankfully not often. It's a good mix, actually, featuring shades of Derrick May's symphonic fantasies, the Orb's beatific ambience, and Air's relaxed dens. It's not exactly a fashionable style these days, and with a small amount of hustle it could become interesting again. Moby's more focused on Destroyed than on recent efforts Last Night or Wait for Me, which is just to say he's less likely to play punk or indie rock dress-up. But this is a dry and flat recording, which is inexcusable given both Moby's resources and how much even a Further-level return to form would benefit everyone involved. The strings flatten into the drums like hair kept too long under a hat. Those samples-- their sentiments unchanged since the late 1990s-- dully brush against the percussion. It's hard to believe that the feeble clacking that underlines ""Rockets"" took more than 10 minutes to program. There is no scrape, no tension, no noisy bullshit, and Destroyed is eminently un-replayable as a result. In a recent interview with The Quietus, Moby speaks to ""The humility that comes from being hated."" Moby's had his punk-ass moments, but at this point he isn't detestable; he's ignorable. It's a trade-off that would break any true rock'n'roll heart. Moby's made it clear he doesn't have that inside him: Fine, but we're still waiting for the moment when the wisdom, experience, and comfort he has earned manifest itself on record. We have lots of great music about the big, lonely, urban world-- some of it's by Moby. What we don't have is lots of music about the perils and contradictions of being a conscientious, horny, middle-aged millionaire. And if Moby's still wondering what people want from him, he's encouraged to start there.","Moby's latest is a soundtrack for late-night cityscapes that plays like a facile representation of these environs instead of an exploration of them.

50 Words for Snow,Kate Bush,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2585e6ef95969322298/1:1/w_160/36d6cabc.jpg,2011-11-21 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16067-50-words-for-snow/,Anti-Fish People,"On ""Wild Man"", the first single from Kate Bush's winterized 10th album, the singer tells of an expedition searching for the elusive Abominable Snowman. ""They want to know you,"" she coos, ""They will hunt you down, then they will kill you/ Run away, run away, run away."" Of course, when it comes to modern popular figures-- who often court fame and adulation with an obsessiveness that can be fascinating or just plain sad-- Bush herself is something of a mythical beast. 50 Words for Snow is only her second album of original material in the last 17 years, and she hasn't performed a full concert since her groundbreaking and theatrical Tour of Life wrapped up its six-week run in 1979. So it's no surprise that she readily sympathizes with the misunderstood monster at the center of ""Wild Man"": ""Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside/ You sound lonely."" 50 Words for Snow is teeming with classic Bush-ian characterizations and stories-- fantasies, personifications, ghosts, mysteries, angels, immortals. As quoted in Graeme Thomson's thorough, thoughtful recent biography Under the Ivy, she explained her attraction to such songwriting: ""[Songs] are just like a little story: you are in a situation, you are this character. This is what happens. End. That's what human beings want desperately. We all love being read stories, and none of us get it anymore."" She's onto something; in our postmodern era, the idea of a tale can seem quaint and simple. But Bush continues to infuse her narratives with a beguiling complexity while retaining some old-school directness. Because while most of this album's songs can be easily summarized-- ""Snowflake"" chronicles the journey of a piece of snow falling to the ground; ""Lake Tahoe"" tells of a watery spirit searching for her dog; ""Misty"" is the one about the woman who sleeps with a lusty snowman (!)-- they contain wondrous multitudes thanks to the singer's still-expressive voice and knack for uncanny arrangements. And mood. There's an appealing creepiness that runs through this album, one that recalls the atmospheric and conceptual back half of her 1985 masterpiece Hounds of Love. Indeed, when considering this singular artist in 2011, it's difficult to think of worthy points of reference aside from Bush herself; her onetime art-rock compatriots David Bowie and Peter Gabriel are currently MIA and in rehash mode, respectively. And while current acts including Florence and the Machine are heavily inspired by Bush's early career and spiritual preoccupations, none are quite able to match their idol's particular brand of heart-on-sleeve mysticism. In an interview earlier this year, the 53-year-old Bush told me she doesn't listen to much new music, and after listening to the stunningly subtle and understated sounds on Snow, it's easy to believe her. The album's shortest song, the gorgeous closing piano ballad ""Among Angels"", clocks in at almost seven minutes. ""Misty"" rolls out its brilliant, funny, and bizarrely touching tale across nearly a quarter of an hour. It's not one second too long. During the 12-year gap between 1993's The Red Shoes and 2005's Aerial when she was raising her son Bertie, Bush gained a new level of compositional patience. She's now allowing her songs to breathe more than ever-- a fact reinforced by this year's Director's Cut, which found her classing-up and often stretching out songs from 1989's The Sensual World and The Red Shoes via re-recordings. So while ""Misty"" is an eyebrow-raiser about getting very intimate with a cold and white being with a ""crooked mouth full of dead leaves,"" it hardly calls attention to its own eccentricities. Propelled by Bush's languid piano and the jazzy, pitter-pattering drums of veteran stick man (but relatively new Bush recruit) Steve Gadd, the song is about as appealingly grown-up as a song about having sex with a snowman can possibly be. In her early career, Bush sometimes let her zaniness get the better of her, highlighting her tales of sexual taboo and bizarre yarns with look-at-me musical accompaniment and videos. Those days are long gone. And her heightened sophistication works wonders here. So when the song's titular being is nowhere to be found the following morning-- ""the sheets are soaking,"" she sings-- there is nothing gimmicky about her desperation: ""Oh please, can you help me?/ He must be somewhere."" The ending of that song brings up another common thread through Snow, aside from its blizzard-y climate. This is an album about trying, oftentimes futilely, to find connections-- between Bush and her characters, reality and surreality, love and death. ""Snowflake"" is a duet with her 13-year-old son, where he plays the small fleck of white falling down from the sky, his high-pitched, choir-boy voice hitting the kind of notes his mom was originally famous for. On the track, Bush encourages her son-- ""The world is so loud/ Keep falling/ I'll find you""-- and yet the plaintive piano that steers things is seemingly aware that, once the flake arrives, it'll either melt or disappear among millions of other icy bits. Similarly, while the lake-bound ghost of ""Lake Tahoe"" is overjoyed to find her long-lost dog-- coincidentally named Snowflake-- at the end of the song, the reunion comes with its own specter of bittersweet afterlife. The same sort of disconnect defines ""Snowed in at Wheeler Street"", an eerie duet with Bush's teenage idol Elton John about a star-crossed pair who have ""been in love forever""-- literally. The time-traveling track finds its leads going from ancient Rome to World War II to 9/11, always losing each other along the way. It acts as something of a sequel to Bush's ""Running Up that Hill"", another tale of pained co-dependence. There's no happy ending. ""When we got to the top of the hill/ We saw Rome burning,"" sings Elton. While much of 50 Words for Snow conjures a whited-out, dream-like state of disbelief, it's important to note that Bush does everything in her power to make all the shadowy phantoms here feel real. Her best music, this album included, has the effect of putting one in the kind of treasured, child-like space-- not so much innocent as open to imagination-- that never gets old. ""I have a theory that there are parts of our mental worlds that are still based around the age between five and eight, and we just kind of pretend to be grown-up,"" she recently told The Independent. ""Our essence is there in a much more powerful way when we're children, and if you're lucky enough to... hang onto who you are, you do have that at your core for the rest of your life."" Snow isn't a blissful retreat to simpler times, though. It's fraught with endings, loss, quiet-- adult things. This is more than pure fantasy. When faced with her unlikely guest on ""Misty"", Bush pinches herself: ""Should be a dream, but I'm not sleepy.""","Kate Bush's second album of original material in the last 17 years is haunting and gorgeous. Like so much of her best music, it's filled with deep story-songs that have the effect of putting one in the kind of treasured, child-like space-- not so much innocent as open to imagination-- that never gets old.

Glossolalia EP,Zambri,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24dc0084474cd0c1f54/1:1/w_160/843587af.jpeg,2011-11-18 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16058-glossolalia/,Kanine,"Cristi Jo and Jessica Zambri earned their first major notices when they showed up, quite suddenly, as back-up singers at Hooray for Earth's buzzy CMJ performance in 2010. (Jessica Zambri and Hooray frontman Noel Heroux are married.) The two bands subsequently traded remixes, resulting in the cleanly anthemic ""Heather"" and peculiarly incoherent ""Comfortable, Comparable"". The latter was a technological massacre: almost a cautionary fable about what it will sound like if our samplers rise up against us. It didn't raise high expectations for how the Zambri sisters-- talented performers, by most reports-- would fare as composers. Their debut EP, Glossolalia, is better, but it's still a distressing piece of work overall, stranded somewhere confusingly between experimental chaos and idiomatic pop. A sliver of sweet-spot exists between those poles-- the Knife basically live on it. But it's hard to hit the head of a pin with a bazooka. Zambri's open warfare against any preconceptions we might have about their experimental bona fides makes Glossolalia a chore to listen to. As means to an unclear end, it stages clashes between brutishly misfiring percussion, keyboard lines so aimlessly broken they're barely melodies, and electronically treated vocal textures, all of which cooperate only haphazardly. Drifting somewhere in the morass are the spooky refrains that inevitably get called pop hooks. The seeds of sound ideas have trouble sprouting amid all the eccentricity of style, and the result is like Zola Jesus with a more prosaic vocal presence but plenty of funny noises to make up for it. The actively unpleasant ""On Call"" is a strange choice for an opener, as its most substantial content is an erratic percussion track that literally sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. It's a loud machine made of random parts that doesn't actually do anything besides grind down its own ill-fitted gears. The inoffensive but plodding ""Heather"" is more structurally lucid but harmonically blurry, which makes it sound like a competent but imperfect mash-up-- just a hair off. The clarion exception is ""To Keep Back"", where the drum, keyboard, and bass tracks were clearly designed to go together, rather than seeming like a one-legged, seven-armed Frankenstein. It also helps that the anesthesia from the first two songs wears off, and the sisters start to really sing, with humanizing swing and soul, unfettered by robotic caveman and barnyard noises. It's not very ""challenging,"" but it's a good, dark electro-pop song by any measure, and sounds fucking epic in the context of this slender, weedy harvest. They're really good at singing! The pains they take to undermine that talent are baffling. While it doesn't reach the modest heights of ""To Keep Back"", the second half of the EP is much more sensible than the first. The bouncy ""News"" boasts interesting bass and melody bits made from filtered vocals, and a more palatable mystic-pop callback of the trainwreck opener probably should have just been the official version. Zambri are still promising-- we may just be hearing the growing pains of a new band figuring out what it's good at. This one seems unaware that its pop instincts are much sharper than its experimental ones. You can tell what they were going for from the title of the EP, which means speaking in tongues. But that has a double connotation of gibberish and inspiration. We get too much of the former and too little of the latter here.","Sisters Cristi Jo and Jessica Zambri earned their first notices when they showed up as back-up singers at Hooray for Earth's 2010 CMJ Performance.

Pinch & Shackleton,Pinch & Shackleton,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b241ea9e61561daa68cc/1:1/w_160/4927f251.jpeg,2011-11-18 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16052-pinch-shackleton/,Honest Jon's,"When I was first exploring bass music, Pinch and Shackleton were gateway artists. Both masters erecting sickly, muted environments, their dub(step) was arty and sprawling enough-- both made use of Middle Eastern samples-- to lure an American rock-kid into England's dance culture. The two artists have been quiet lately: Pinch retreated into dance-oriented 12""s in addition to curating his Tectonic imprint, while Shackleton moved to Berlin and released some minimal techno for a minimal-techno label (an excellent one). Announced and released last week by the astute Honest Jon's label, Pinch & Shackleton is a welcome return to each artist's peculiar roots. Despite obvious common ground, Shackleton and Pinch achieve their thick headspaces in different ways-- Shackleton the austere, death-obsessed perfectionist and Pinch the reggae-savvy producer unafraid to let a mediocre rapper sully his tracks. Rather than a summing of styles, Pinch & Shackleton plays as a vision of what bass music was a half-decade ago, two producers' onetime vision of progress. It benefits massively from a lack of artists interested in these sounds: In 2011 bass music is brighter, or deeper, or more aggressive. P&S is not very bright or deep or aggressive; its nine tracks often file forward with quiet confidence but without explicit purpose. The duo stresses clarity: Synths float well above Shackleton's exacting percussion (its complexity dialed back here), sub-bass rumble, and vocal samples applied judiciously. When the music floats hazily by, such as during the opening minutes of ""Levitation"", it is an intentional, manicured float. Four minutes into ""Cracks in the Pleasuredome"" the duo dials up shards of a Middle Eastern vocal cadence, and I'm reminded of a type of mystical-industrial fantasies Pinch and Shackleton are capable of conjuring. ""Selfish Greedy Life"" chatters ominously, little demons competing for attention with steam-vent bursts and saucer-like patches. ""Monks on the Rum"" is the duo's palette stretched on putty, diffuse and manipulated but no less composed. This is not the foggy, soft-focus paranoia of an artist like Burial, whose work has informed so much underground electronic composition; Pinch and Shackleton don't want to suggest darkness; they want to create it. They do so with familiar tones and structures, but ones that remain effective: see, after three minutes of whispering synths and whinnying flutes, if the bass drop of ""Burning Blood"" doesn't make you smell something. In 2011, Pinch and Shackleton are a sensory experience; their waters are crystal clear, but sometimes you don't want to know what's at the bottom of the lake. Let's be excited they're showing us again.","Pinch & Shackleton is a welcome return to the seminal dubstep producers' peculiar roots.

Freeclouds,Carter Tanton,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2445e6ef95969322279/1:1/w_160/87b38842.jpeg,2011-11-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16049-freeclouds/,Western Vinyl,"The work of Carter Tanton is relatively unknown outside of tight-knit indie circles, but there's already evidence to suggest he's going to be a lifer. In 2007 he released a record of bullish roots rock with Tulsa titled I Was Submerged, only for that band to disintegrate before their potential was fully realized. Tanton has subsequently worked with Marissa Nadler and Baltimore art punks Lower Dens, establishing himself as a guitarist with both bands. His presence in Lower Dens continues, but he has also found time to record Freeclouds, an all-over-the-map solo effort that tugs strongly on the aura of David Bowie's ""Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud"" for inspiration. Tanton is more rooted in earthly matters than Bowie, lending much of this record an agrarian feel that meshes with surges of serrated energy, perfectly intersecting his work with Nadler and Lower Dens. Part of Tanton's appeal to other players surely comes from his studio skills. Freeclouds was mostly recorded at home, but you'd never know it. Tracks like ""Murderous Joy"" and ""Saturday"" may bear tinny drum sounds, but it sounds like an aesthetic choice rather than one forced upon him. Like a lot of people in his position, Tanton's biggest strength is as a composer and arranger rather than a lyricist. There's a mid-section on ""Murderous Joy"" where all the clutter drops away for a few seconds and an affected guitar sound sags and swoons, digging out a feeling of loss that reaches somewhere far more meaningful than his strained Wilco-lite vocals. But this is an album of ever-shifting modes, where Tanton's singing remain constantly fluid, occasionally spreading out toward a Chris Martin-style rush (""Landlines"") and sometimes wallowing in a lower registry lament reminiscent of Bradford Cox in his Atlas Sound guise (""Fake Pretend""). His desire to process his voice on multiple songs perhaps suggests he hasn't found his feet as a singer yet, although it's more likely to tie into his need to constantly dabble with the overall sound. The most successful experiments are prized out of the glitchy electronics Tanton likes to work with-- ""Gauze of Song"" bears a fizzy backing that sounds like old analog circuitry burning out and going haywire, while ""Pasture Sound"" fixes bright acoustic plucking to a bed of rippling beats that are all buried in a warm coat of fuzz two-thirds of the way through. There's a sense of hippy idealism that pervades throughout Freeclouds, edging toward the kind of wide-eyed sentiment John Lennon practiced at his least cynical. That feel is best manifested in Tanton's Lennon-like cover of ""Saturday"" by Sparklehorse, which sits at the center of this record and unfolds with an ease that the stilted material elsewhere never quite reaches. It's not clear what Tanton wanted this album to be, especially when he takes wild diversions into the Mary Chain-isms of ""Horrorscope"" and the pitch-bent shoegazer-y backing of ""Land Lines"". It's a loose collection of whims and desires, unrolled over vast expanses of terrain that Tanton could survey for a while to see how they fit. That makes sense for someone who has made a career of gifting his talents to a diverse collection of other artists, but further solo ventures could use some big picture thinking to add the edge of clarity Freeclouds is lacking.","Having worked with Lower Dens, Marissa Nadler, and Tulsa, Carter Tanton offers a solo album that finds his production and arranging skills in fine form, while his songwriting is all over the map.

Live at the South Bank,Kieran HebdenMats GustafssonSteve Reid,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b253c0084474cd0c1f62/1:1/w_160/6007a79b.jpeg,2011-11-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16063-live-at-the-south-bank/,Smalltown Supersound,"At the start of ""The Sun Never Sets"", the last song of the six-piece set Live at the South Bank, drummer Steve Reid sounds tired. He lags slightly behind the flickering electronic phrases of collaborator Kieren Hebden, better known as Four Tet, like he's forgotten the clip of the tune that opened their 2007 album, Tongues. It would be hard to blame Reid, after all; at this point, just 10 months before he died of throat cancer last year, the 65-year-old was an hour deep into a June 2009 performance with Reid and fierce Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson in London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. They'd been busy, too. Earlier, the trio had taken four of five numbers well past the 10-minute mark. The only relatively brief piece had been ""Lyman Palace"", for which Gustafsson finally stepped onto the stage and-- with his deep, broad bellows-- injected a ferocity that bordered on frightening. You'd be tired, too. But Reid's story has never really been a tale of quitting. A teenager drummer in New York, he famously gigged with James Brown and the Vandellas before serving a two-year prison sentence for his Vietnam evasion. He returned to the kit upon release, eventually forming his own group (with at least one really great album to their name) and working with legends spread across several different forms-- R&B legend Dionne Warwick, astral jazz traveler Sun Ra and African icon, and iconoclast Fela Kuti. In 1986, he even added a touch of percussion to Miles Davis' Tutu. But for a player who was drumming with the stars by the time he was 16, much of the success and steady work that might've seemed logical for Reid mostly proved elusive. Through the 1990s and into the first half of the last decade, his output could be described, at best, as a trickle. But that all changed when, as legend has it, Hebden watched Gustafsson perform at the Oslo Jazz Festival in 2004. He decided he needed a drummer and, more importantly, a collaborative partner. After Hebden, Reid's trickle became something of a deluge. The two first played together in 2005, and Hebden played on parts of Reid's fantastic record for Soul Jazz that year, Spirit Walk. They summarily released two albums, The Exchange Sessions Vols. 1 and 2, recorded in a single day at London's Exchange Mastering Studios. Hebden's albums as Four Tet had often seemed about a sort of robotic composure, pairing an elegant sense of melody to a composer's eye for development; these collaborations with Reid, though, showed a young musician interested in letting loose those fetters, in playing with more interest in the perfect personal musical moment than pristine dance-floor momentum. Reid and Hebden continued to flirt with flashes of brilliance on 2007's Tongues and 2008's NYC, but they never seemed to cash in on their true potential. Sometimes, it seemed, Hebden couldn't push away from his compulsion to build big songs, no matter how hard Reid banged the drums at his back. On South Bank-- the most vital and essential document of Reid and Hebden's five-year partnership-- it feels clear that, at least onstage, they were finally able to go the distance. The invocation ""Morning Prayer"" opens slowly, circling in space with a meditative calm. For 17 minutes, the pair traces lines around the other's rhythm, Hebden's electronics and keys shaping a cradle for Reid's busy tom-and-cymbal patter, and vice versa. Back in 2006, on Volume 1, ""Morning Prayer"" felt slight but suggestive, as if Reid and Hebden were only testing the water; here, they're living in it. In London that night, Gustafsson was so mesmerized by the pair's chemistry that he forgot to join until the piece was done. When he finally enters, though, he fits readily, adding a strange new mix of aggression and soul to ""Lyman Place"". He sounds like an air-raid siren but quotes Coltrane; Reid and Hebden respond in kind, their own treatment reinvigorated by a stranger who didn't know its original bounds. ""People Be Happy"", originally heard on 2007's Tongues, capitalizes on that openness, too, with the trio pushing the tune's distinctive fragment of a melody into a strange, elliptical sphere. Gustafsson and Reid wind strands of sound through one another, while Hebden sits back, building a back-and-forth bed of sound upon which they both move. As accomplished with fierce, focused marches (""Untitled"") as they are with open-ended textural explorations (""25th Street""), this one-time-only trio understood its own extremes-- and how to navigate breathlessly, relentlessly, and brazenly between them. As ""The Sun Never Sets"" progresses, Reid's fatigue turns out to be only a passing notion. Just three minutes in, he's forcing the rest of the squad to twist one of the most memorable melodies of his work with Hebden into unrecognizable patterns. He jumps from cymbals to kick drum, from toms to cymbals. Gustafsson broods, and Hebden wraps the theme in a fuselage of noise. They distend what seems like the end, stretching the coda into a slow exhalation. But as everyone else starts to fade, Reid remains, pounding his drums a little harder than you might expect after these nearly 90 bustling minutes, like he wants to keep going.","The most vital document of Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) and drummer Steve Reid's five-year partnership is this performance as a one-time trio with Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson recorded 10 months before the 66-year-old Reid died of throat cancer.

The Smiths Complete,The Smiths,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21c9d034d5c69bf4b06/1:1/w_160/8e7c948b.jpeg,2011-11-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/,Rhino,"There have been better bands than the Smiths, but there has never been a more perfect band, in the sense of having a distinct, deliberate, powerful aesthetic shaped by the tensions of collaboration, combined with the ability to articulate that aesthetic. This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing. From the Smiths' first single, ""Hand in Glove"", in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's ""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now"" or Reparata and the Delrons' ""Shoes"", for instance, and thinking ohhh, now I get it.) The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, very deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album. But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the breadth of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him. It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins ""The Headmaster Ritual""-- Marr has called his riff what Joni Mitchell ""would have done had she been an MC5 fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's ""This Charming Man"" to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of ""What Difference Does It Make?"" or ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" or ""London"" would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing. Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, The Smiths is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (""Reel Around the Fountain"") was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's ""Tempted""). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on The Smiths, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, ""Suffer Little Children"", is explicitly about the Moors murders. Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of ""Miserable Lie"" doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid. Released nine months after The Smiths, Hatful of Hollow, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than The Smiths-- the sequencing turns Hatful's miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles Hatful collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both ""How Soon Is Now?"" and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the B-sides to ""William, It Was Really Nothing"". Meat Is Murder-- which followed Hatful by a mere three months-- is better recorded than The Smiths, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"" is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on Meat's lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for ""Barbarism Begins at Home"", seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the title track's tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto. 1986's The Queen Is Dead is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play pi-anner"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in ""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side"" are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on ""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011. Even after The Queen Is Dead, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. The World Won't Listen came out in the U.K. five weeks before Louder Than Bombs appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on World, three are reprised from The Queen Is Dead and one from Meat Is Murder, and the last is an instrumental. The World Won't Listen starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of ""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby"". Louder Than Bombs augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from Hatful of Hollow, along with the material from the ""Sheila Take a Bow"" single. It's much better sequenced than World, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus ""Panic"", a rewrite of T. Rex's ""Metal Guru"" about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus ""Ask"", a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live. The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's Strangeways, Here We Come, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than ""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before"". Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (""Death at One's Elbow"" is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, ""I Won't Share You"", is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway. To be fair, ""Paint a Vulgar Picture"" is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. Rank, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the Queen Is Dead tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to ""Rusholme Ruffians"", but it's uncharacteristically inessential. And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! Complete follows the Best... sets, Singles, The Very Best of the Smiths, The Sound of the Smiths, and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (Hatful of Hollow, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent ""Jeane"". Well, they never claimed not to be perverse.","This box of remastered editions of Smiths albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing. ""Complete"", however, is a profoundly inaccurate description.

"Chinoiseries, Pt. 2",Onra,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23fc0084474cd0c1f3f/1:1/w_160/134788ae.jpeg,2011-11-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16051-chinoiseries-pt-2/,All City,"Chinoiserie is a French term that refers to the application of Chinese influences in art, a practice that was especially in vogue in the sphere of European art around the 17th century. Chinoiseries, on the other hand, is the name of a 2007 album from electronic producer Onra. The title holds weight, kind of; Onra's French, his familial lineage can be traced back to Vietnam, and-- most importantly-- the album-cum-beat-tape drew heavily from samples of old Chinese and Vietnamese records for dusty boom-bap inspiration. Onra's career has often been about drawing from sounds associated with far-away (for him, anyway) places; last year's brilliant Long Distance didn't so much appropriate the thick, silky sounds of R&B and funk as it did wear those genres' resemblances like a close-fitting jacket. Those awaiting a logical follow-up to that release, unfortunately, are going to have to wait a little longer: as the title suggests, his new album Chinoiseries, Pt. 2 is a return to the first installment's Asian-samples-meets-hip-hop-beats concept. It's a conceit that, as Onra presumably tips his hat to with this collection's ""One For the Wu"", is not exactly a new one, and Lord Quas knows that beat-tape LPs aren't exactly a scarcity, especially as J Dilla's influence looms large (along with his ability to be name-checked in relation to seemingly everything these days). Onra's pretty good at the beat-tape thing, though, as evidenced by the first Chinoiseries and 2009's comparatively formalist 1.0.8 (Long Distance is also a similarly built album, just in a very solid, well-structured manner). Chinoiseries, Pt. 2, by comparison, is a strange failure of an album, possibly because the quality of the content seldom (if never) rises above its been-there, heard-that nature. The Pt. 2 says it all, really; it's more of the same, diminishing returns and all. The source material contributes to the ""diminishing returns"" part; there are moments when Onra crafts brief gems wielding slow spookiness (""Mais Theme"") and lyrical melodic turns (""Where I'm From""), but there's not much on display in terms of ideas, most tracks wearing out their welcome regardless of their brevity (only a few scattered tracks top out over two minutes). As an album proper, Chinoiseries, Pt. 2 is a bit of a patience-tester. For one, it's long (a mind-boggling 32 tracks that stretch across 58 minutes), and other than a pair of bookending cuts titled ""The Arrival"" and ""The End"", respectively, there's not much here that suggests a thoughtful approach to proper album sequencing. Maybe if we weren't expected to regard this as a proper album instead of what it really is-- a data dump that's enjoyable in small bursts but incredibly spotty as a total body of work-- it wouldn't be so disappointing. The issue, however, is that said disappointment possibly has less to do with the album at hand than the one that preceded it. A potential breakthrough like Long Distance, a record that took a fresh, engaging approach to form that's been in danger of sounding tired for a minute now, deserves a proper follow-up, or at least an attempt at one. Chinoseries, Pt. 2 is neither of those, and that's okay-- it's Onra's career, after all-- but such an allowance doesn't make listening to it any more enjoyable.","Instead of following the thick, silky R&B and funk of last year's Long Distance, the electronic producer Onra has returned to 2007's Chinoiseries and its combination of old Chinese and Vietnamese records and hip-hop beats.

Biasonic Hotsauce: Birth of the Nanocloud,Zed Bias,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23a13d197565213a72e/1:1/w_160/253da825.jpeg,2011-11-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16046-bionic-hotsauce-birth-of-the-nanocloud/,Tru Thoughts,"For better or worse, the science-fiction concept album is a dance-music staple. In addition to being saddled with one of the most ungainly album titles of the year, Biasonic Hotsauce: Birth of the Nanocloud is the first part of a proposed trilogy of albums where UK garage/drum'n'bass/dubstep producer Zed Bias will tell the tale of… an experiment gone wrong? Something vaguely futuristic? To be honest, I've listened to this thing a bunch of times now, and the narrative thrust remains elusive. And the storyline, confined to a few ignorable skits of kitschy playacting, barely impinges on the music. Instead, the ""Nanocloud"" concept seems more like a flimsy and silly but ultimately harmless way to unite a dozen-plus tracks that might otherwise seem to belong on wholly different albums. Like many producers who refused to go away quietly when grime and dubstep stole UK garage's thunder, Bias has explored as many styles and subgenres as he's been able to get away with since his turn-of-the-millennium UKG glory days. So there's not much of a ""signature"" on Biasonic Hotsauce and certainly not much you haven't heard before if you've been following British dance music for the last 10 years. From hammering dancehall-inflected dubstep to slickly anonymous commercial house, Bias treats BH like an outsider-friendly party tape, heavy on the obvious hooks and boisterous rapping and layer of high-end gloss applied to even the starkest tracks. This little-bit-of-everything approach to modern UK dance culture is welcome, given how alienating ""pure"" dubstep records can be for non-fans. Biasonic Hotsauce can sometimes feel like an alternate universe take on Kevin Martin's the Bug project, with the nuclear-grade noise swapped out for radio-friendliness. (Or at least pirate-radio-friendliness.) But the jack-of-all-dance-trades tack also reveals that, for all his restless experimentation, Bias' skill set hasn't evolved much over the last decade. What he does best here-- merging the boom of Jamaican ragga with the runway-show opulence of deep house and the punchy-but-still-pop beats of R&B and soca-- sounds remarkably similar to the sound that first brought him to underground prominence over a decade ago. The great early run of tracks on BH work the same beguiling and unstable middle ground, where the rhythmic dexterity of high-class dance music for grown-ups meets blunt-force street kid grit, which defined the late-1990s/early-00s peak of UK garage. The low-end of ""Yagga"" has all the thuggish heaviness of dubstep, but the frisky rhythms show up the genre's stereotypical thump as a drag. Though BH has enough bass wobble and crass Ibiza synth hooks to mark it out definitively as a 2011 release, the drums on the first-tier tracks still have the intricate and far more interesting syncopations of old-school garage. It's sad but telling that Bias is still leaning on his biggest and best tune here, 2000's uptown dancehall smash ""Neighbourhood"", given a wholly unnecessary dubstep-era update for BH. After that bracing opening stretch, there are a handful of half-brilliant tracks in the same vein strewn across the album, especially the shiver-inducing ""Lucid Dreams"", echoing the minimalist future funk and disembodied vocals that once defined UKG at its outermost, without the dour murk Burial now brings to the mix. But whenever Bias leaves his comfort zone, the excitement and energy drains away, and he comes up with tracks that settle for being competent style exercises, like ""Koolade"" with its campy take on 1980s boogie. The final trio of ""straight"" dubstep tracks are just too damn polite to even be called bangers, risking neither the grossly enjoyable excess of the genre's populist wing nor the form-pushing innovation of its avant school. As so often when it comes to dance-music full-lengths, Bias' good ideas get lost in the sea of makeweight stuff, and his attempt to please just about everyone results in a frustratingly spotty album.","UK dance producer Zed Bias treats the first installment of a proposed sci-fi trilogy like an outsider-friendly party tape.

777: The Desanctification,Blut Aus Nord,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2489d034d5c69bf4b4c/1:1/w_160/edce3a49.jpeg,2011-11-17 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16055-777-the-desanctification/,Debemur Morti,"One of the year's biggest threads in heavy music has centered on the loose enclave of American metal bands reshaping black metal and, in turn, introducing it to fresh faces. From Liturgy and Locrian to Horseback and Atlas Moth, they've each manipulated the decades-old, forever-infamous strain in their own identifiable ways. Whatever your views on Hunter Hunt-Hendrix's verbosity or Krallice's kinetic cascades, it's inarguable that they've all passed the sounds of corpsepaint and battle axes to bigger, more generalized crowds not overly concerned with someone's respective KVLT credentials. One reason for this, of course, is that these bands generally look and talk mostly like your average rock dudes; they give interviews, tour, and generally wear band T-shirts and tattered jeans. They're not the first North Americans to mutate black metal, neither by a long shot nor by a decade, but they are distinctly identifiable people manipulating a sound that, compared to the indie mainstream, feels exotic and perhaps a tad dangerous. For the last 15 years, Blut Aus Nord-- the one-man band French musician Vindsval-- has twisted the idea and essence of black metal into new shapes. He's added the crushing reverberations of prime Godflesh and the militant pacing of Ministry, saturating some of his best moments with relentless drones and splintering noise. Several Blut Aus Nord albums are not only incontrovertible classics but also compelling evidence of the obvious-- that all this talk of metal's experimental interests is accurate, if just very overdue. Vindsval hasn't done himself any favors, either: He doesn't tour, doesn't issue album lyrics, and doesn't say much in public. In press photos, he is often hooded and shrouded in darkness. The same hermetic mystique that's helped push artists like Jandek, Burial, and MF DOOM into an ironic spotlight has mostly kept Blut Aus Nord in, well, the shadows. But audiences historically love a trilogy, a supposition that, combined with black metal's recent widespread notice, might deservedly help lift Blut Aus Nord out of relative obscurity. After all, the first two installations of the band's three-part 777 are two of this year's best-built records. 777 Sect(s), released in April, is an obliterative march through rigorous black metal, apocalyptic post-rock, and speaker-rattling industrial tangents. ""Epitome 4"" encapsulated that approach with vocals that sounded as if Vindsval were being strangled by the battery of drums and guitars marching around him with Teutonic precision. Through its 12 minutes, the song took unpredictable turns-- dissonant counter-melodies here, a choir of ghouls there, even almost-pretty tones suggesting some relief in the distance. Unapologetically heavy, Sect(s) was the trilogy's breathless start. The Desanctification is less extreme than its predecessor, with generally shorter tracks (only the opener breaks the eight-minute mark) and even an atmospheric instrumental impasse that's as delicate as it is foreboding. Where Sect(s) raced open on a string of blast beats, stage two lumbers forward with a simple mid-tempo throb. Repetitive guitar lines and stabs of noise circle sickly above. Those background coos from ""Epitome 4"" have grown into a full choir by album-opening ""Epitome 7"". (So far, the series lasts just less than 90 minutes, with each of its 12 tracks named and numbered as a sequential ""Epitome"".) That's not to say Desanctification is an easy-listening experience, as some stretches here are so stuffed with electronic drums and echoing guitars that a claustrophobe could go catatonic listening to it. But the riffs are tempered with a certain accessibility, as with the Isis-like hook of ""Epitome 10"", and the rhythms occasionally back into something nearly danceable, as with the stuttering clip that quakes through ""Epitome 11"".  Essentially, it's more dynamic than its predecessor, making stops at most every point between the frantic rush of ""Epitome 8"" and the doom-like stasis of ""Epitome 12"". There's more movement, more development, more variety; fitting for a trilogy's middle, it's where the sounds get thicker, where the possibilities simply become more intriguing. Perhaps Blut Aus Nord's cult status to this point is an unwitting setup for this strange moment, when television stars create parodies of black metal in major music magazines and an alt-country stud hosts a very funny but also very reverent talk show about the stuff. Perhaps this is the moment when the thing that actually does matter-- you know, Blut Aus Nord's music, captured here in a so-far, so-perfect trilogy-- will supplant Vindsval's lack of indie rock-ready gestures, like press photos or Scion showcases. After all, 777 Sect(s) and 777: The Desanctification are as distinctive and daunting as anything else that's given buzz to black metal this year.","For the last 15 years, Blut Aus Nord-- the one-man band of mysterious French musician Vindsval-- has twisted black metal into new shapes.

Streetz Calling,Future,by: Jordan Sargent,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b245c0084474cd0c1f48/1:1/w_160/72e70a4e.jpeg,2011-11-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16054-streetz-calling/,self-released,"As the epicenter of popular rap music, Atlanta is known as the birthplace and the machine for most of this generation's major gangster stars. But in its own way, Atlanta is also something like the L.A. of the black music industry, a place where pure, unadulterated pop and club music grows and mutates, and sometimes interacts with the mainstream, like when T.I.'s derided ""Whatever You Like"" became his biggest hit ever. For the most part, though, the purest of Atlanta pop-rap is an underground phenomenon followed feverishly by teens, young adults, and adults who wish they were still young adults (as engrossingly chronicled by Michael Schmelling, Kelefa Sanneh, and Will Welch in their book Atlanta) and whose stars burn quick and fast. D4L and Soulja Boy and Shawty Lo and Yung L.A. have all more or less come and gone, but there are always guys ready to fill the space, if only for six or 12 months. Every high school class has its own heroes. Future, an Atlanta born and bred singer/rapper, is currently wearing the crown, and if he doesn't prove to have a longer shelf life than most, his star will have maybe burned the brightest. You may know his voice from the hook and second verse of ""Racks"" (on racks on racks), one of the biggest club hits of the early year, or from ""Tony Montana"", his current underground smash that features him rapping in a ridiculous voice that's a very rough approximation of that of the movie character. But this is often ridiculous and very rough music, and Future pulls it off well; the song is one of the most fun tracks of the year. Peers are now starting to attach themselves to the guy with the hot hand, too: Drake blessed Future with a verse for the ""Tony Montana"" remix, and with the remix to ""Magic"" (his other underground smash), Future somehow secured T.I.'s most recent ""first verse since being released from jail."" Streetz Calling is his most recent mixtape, and to give you an idea of how quickly these things move, none of the aforementioned songs appears. Instead of milking his hits dry, Future is presumably providing a breeding ground for new ones. He's so far basically come as close as anyone to perfecting this thread of ringtone pop, where singing and rapping are practically the same thing, and conversing 100% through Auto-Tune doesn't mean you still can't talk about how you used to sell drugs. It would almost feel antiquated if Future weren't amassing hits, or if he weren't bringing some subtle new dimensions to the micro-genre. His near-complete integration of singing and rapping comes off as something born out of genuine inspiration, and less like a decision made because he's just not very good at rapping (like Yung L.A.) or seemingly bored by the entire idea of it (paging Soulja Boy). He's smooth enough on ""Unconditional Love"" to recall the time when Lil Wayne's Auto-Tune experiments were kind of romantic, and gritty enough on ""Never Be the Same"" to evoke dancehall singers who have used Auto-Tune to accentuate their pain. There are tracks here that hew closer to rap music, and though some lose his identity in the process, others highlight his ability to move closer to either pole and still make good music. ""Power of That P"", especially, is the work of someone full of ideas, as Future riffs on the letter, tying in everything from ""promethazine"" to ""petroleum"" to ""Peru."" On ""E"" he works fine over a muted brassy beat next to Trouble, one of the city's most promising goon rappers, and on ""The Way it Go"" he sounds right at home over Zaytoven's candy-coated keyboard funk. He's at his best when the amalgamation of rap and pop is more pronounced, but he's good enough when deciding to indulge his gangster impulses. Future works as prolifically as most artists need to these days, and a number of his tracks, including, say, a third on Streetz Calling, keep it moving without making any sort of impression. It's par for the course for the style of music he's trafficking in and for the way the game is played now, but Future's batting average is notable, and as more of his tracks become hits (however minor), his ability begins to speak for itself. This is pop music before it happens, and Future seems equipped to outlast many of the artists that paved a path for him.","Atlanta singer/rapper Future-- who has scored guest verses from Drake and T.I.-- is currently wearing the city's pop-rap crown.

Music From the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle / Black Foliage: Animation Music Vol. 1,The Olivia Tremor Control,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23c13d197565213a732/1:1/w_160/a7e4f534.jpeg,2011-11-17 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16047-otc/,ChunkletChunklet,"""Will Hart scored a guitar organ,"" Elf Power keyboardist Laura Carter recalled in an interview with PopMatters five years ago, ""so of course there's a little wave where everyone's album has a guitar organ on it."" A lovely idea, isn't it? Everyone always making an album, anything they'd need on hand. That-- and a profoundly abiding love of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson-- is the germ of the idea that became Elephant 6, four boyhood friends' loosely-knit Louisiana-born, Georgia-bred turn-of-the-century psychedelic society and recording concern. The sheer number of people involved in the creation of the two records Will Cullen Hart and childhood pal Bill Doss helmed under the elegant name of the Olivia Tremor Control counts in the dozens. And though other Elephant 6 records would eventually capture more imaginations, the music on 1996's Music From the Unrealized Film Script, Dusk at Cubist Castle and 1999's Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One-- impossibly strange, omnivorously eclectic psych-pop-- are worlds unto themselves, the finest realizations of whatever sonic utopia these guys spent much of the 90s etching into a canvas a million cassettes wide. Hart, Doss, Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum, and Apples in Stereo frontman (and Dusk producer) Robert Schneider grew up filling up Tascams with four-track nonsense in and around their Ruston, Louisiana, home, exploring genres headlong and forging bands at will. An early project called Cranberry Lifecycle eventually coalesced into Hart, Doss, and Mangum's Synthetic Flying Machine; from there, Mangum forged Neutral Milk Hotel, while Hart and Doss set about mapping out the Olivias' all-encompassing sound, some unthinkable matchup of Revolver-era Beatles or Smile-era Beach Boys, the tornado-alley skronk of 1980s Flaming Lips and Butthole Surfers, and the surreal wooze of post-Reichian tape manipulation. The singularity of Mangum's peculiar vision for In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is what makes that record such a landmark; it's the multiplicity of the Olivias' music, though, that's their great legacy, their ever-changing, borderline egoless, all-together-now notion of what a psychedelic record could be. Veering wildly between sturdy sunshine-pop and sloppy ambient noise, calamitous hooks and conversations with the godhead, the Olivias' records are driven by an impossibly expansive vision. It's like Hart sings on ""A Peculiar Noise Called 'Train Director'"", a song about, among other things, moving in with a sound: ""in the blink of an eye, you get several meanings."" In hindsight, the decidedly strange Dusk at Cubist Castle is the straight of the pair. Stately, sumptuous, and slightly otherworldly, Dusk is brimming with immaculate hooks and queries bound for the cosmos. Dusk's first half is certainly the most immediate stretch of songcraft OTC laid to tape, big, sinewy hooks brought to life in brilliant color. ""The Opera House"" is a blur of fuzz guitar and harmonica, leading off with the funny notion of going to the movies just to watch the actors move their mouths. The surreality of it all is certainly worth a mention: Catchy as they are, these songs are riddled with potholes, with weird left turns, with hooks that seem to bubble out of nowhere before receding into themselves. The one-two of ""Jumping Fences"" and ""Define a Transparent Dream"", joined at the hip by a gloriously gooey transition, are a triumph of taut pop proficiency. Littered as they are with references to the atmosphere breathing with life and a lonely psychonaut too caught up inside his head for speech, though, these tunes seek to transcend both consensus reality and the constraints of the straight-outta-1966 vibe of so many of their E6 contemporaries. Though clearly besotted with the freewheeling pop of the late-1960s-- Bill Doss' eternally impressive sideburns are testament enough to that-- they cut their songs with too many intersecting ideas to ever feel too fixed in one particular place for very long. Black Foliage's pop moments are gnarlier, more restless, their hooks arriving at odd angles; all this they weave through a tapestry of orchestral bleats and backward-running loops, five seconds of scuzz enveloping four minutes of sheer bliss. Rather than relegate its sonic tinkering to its second act, Black Foliage dunks OTC's experimental tendencies directly into their popcraft. It's a magisterial vision, a whole world rendered in sound; it is also, at first, rather overwhelming, its constantly shifting sonics more than a little tough to settle into from moment to moment. Give yourself over to it, though, and Black Foliage is among the most satisfying psychedelic albums of any decade, a carefully controlled caterwauling chaos pushing along Hart and Doss' unanswerable questions and anthropomorphisms. You're aware of the Bardo, yeah? Black Foliage seems intimately acquainted with the thing, touting as it does both individuality (""don't hide away from your intricacies"") and something more inexplicable; ""I have been floated to this thought this hour,"" Hart, Schneider, and eventually Mangum sing, ""on a series of events I cannot explain."" Black Foliage is not some work of accidental genius, some acid-fueled inspiration point captured as it's being created; every wriggly second reveals painstaking craft, every hint of tape hiss seems to whisper of another good idea buried somewhere in the static. Still, it's pretty clear that the relationship these guys had with non-musical psychedelia was, at the time, fairly recent, and Black Foliage seems to carry hints of something a little beyond this world. The large-scale sonic experiments-- swaths of silence, planes flying overhead, of alarm clocks and ambient drift-- that engulf much of the second half of both of these LPs are, even for longtime E6 devotees, something of a hurdle. Even in the midst of the woollier Black Foliage songs, their contrast with the pop-minded stuff that precedes them is so great, their tunefulness next to nil, the results are certainly self-indulgent and, for many, kinda boring; I had a friend in college who'd burned himself Cubist Castle with most of the eighth (and longest) ""Green Typewriters"" lobbed off so he wouldn't have to keep skipping it. Again, though, this seems to be the band's attempt at wrestling the psychedelic experience-- the initial flash, followed by the inward gaze-- into sound. They're not working through McKenna or the Tibetan Book of the Dead or anything here, but they bring the trip through all its stages; at the end, you're summarily exhausted and full of questions, your synapses having wriggled themselves awake one by one over the preceding quarter-hour. And, frankly, for guys who can bang out pop songs like they could, their experimental tendencies are very nearly as impressive; their noise is lush, their silence speaks volumes, and best of all, they're in on the joke. At the end of the extra-long ""Green Typewriters"", Hart jumps into another with a question-as-punchline: ""how much longer can I wait?"" Though Cubist Castle appears untouched, Black Foliage has been remastered from the original tapes; the bass is a bit louder, the vocals a little fuller, and there's ever-so-slightly more clarity in certain patches. But the whirr of some dust-addled four-track still sits underneath these songs, which is as it should be. Either set comes with a download card good for hours upon hours of outtakes, alternates, radio sessions, and the like, much of it unreleased, out-of-print, or otherwise unheard. Taken together, the extra stuff's longer than the albums themselves; hey, nobody ever accused these guys of being especially judicious editors. I'm still working my way through the second disc of the Smile box myself, so all this seemed a little much at first, especially when they launch into their own stoned ""Do You Like Worms"" medley. But, listening to the extras, you realize just how much they were capable of, just how powerful their overarching vision for these records really was; four minutes from the very good ""The Sky Is a Harpsichord Canvas"" were excised from Black Foliage due to time constraints, and while it's fun to hear the expanded song itself in the spirit of excavation, knowing what didn't make the cut makes the remaining bits seem that much stronger. Flecks of the recurring instrumental themes that run through Cubist Castle and (especially) Black Foliage-- a little cohesion amidst all the cacophony-- speckle the edges of the bonus stuff as well, further testament to just how much lightning these guys were bottling. But it's the records themselves-- insistent, wise, daringly imperfect-- that are really the thing here. They remain the sound of a few old friends, a few more new acquaintances, and a thousand wasted sunny days spent carving out a couple mind-bendingly complex masterpieces.","These two impossibly strange, expansive psych-pop records from 1996 and 1999 are worlds unto themselves.

Sonne = Blackbox,Ursula Bogner,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2399d034d5c69bf4b32/1:1/w_160/97064a06.jpeg,2011-11-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16044-sonne-blackbox/,Faitiche,"Earlier this year Tom Ewing wrote a Poptimist column about records with interesting backstories that were probably false. The music released under the name Ursula Bogner-- first an album called Recordings 1969-1988, now a follow-up collection called Sonne = Blackbox-- is an excellent example of what he was talking about. Released on Faitiche, the label started by veteran electronic music producer and theorist Jan Jelinek, this music is purported to come from a woman who was completely unknown during her lifetime and died in 1994. Bogner is said to have lived a life as a housewife and experimented with electronics and tapes away from the public eye, and the music she left behind fits loosely with that made by BBC Radiophonic Workshop experimentalists like Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire. Instead of maintaining the ruse as a cynical PR cash-in-- which would be silly because, let's face it, very few people are going to spend money for this music-- Jelinek is treating the Bogner phenomenon as a multimedia art experiment with musical, textual, and performative components. This second set of Bogner-named works, allegedly curated by frequent Jelinek associate Andrew Pekler, comes packaged with a 130-page book that explores, in pieces written in both English and German, ideas of identity, ownership, gender, and more, along with probing how information is transmitted through the media. There's a piece in the book by songwriter and commentator Momus and lengthy interviews conducted by Jelinek, where, among other things, he interrogates people on why the Bogner story seems fake. The interviews in particular are an essential part of this project, because they get at how listeners construct narratives around music. One answer to Jelinek's question about the skepticism surrounding Bogner boils down to the press release being too detailed as far as her biography and making too much of her being a housewife. The exchange highlights how music journalists glean ""truth"" from the printed matter they are presented with recordings, and how this exchange can be manipulated. Beyond the accompanying book, Jelinek and Pekler are currently playing the music of Ursula Bogner at shows, improvising new music to accompany her ""old"" tape loops. In addition to the writing, the book, and the live revue, we also have this, an album of recorded sound that, given its unspecified origins, exists in the context of your choosing. And I'm happy to report that the music is mostly very good, especially if you are a fan of Jelinek's loop-based aesthetic and unfailing ear for texture and musical structure (an approach to sound that has a great deal of overlap with Pekler's recorded work). Whether created by Jelinek, Pekler, or someone else, the Bogner pieces range from engaging electronic curiosities-- notable mostly for mixing vintage-sounding electronics with editing that would have been very difficult to achieve in the year they were supposed to have been created-- to hair-raising collages whose subtle force is, if you're wired at all like I am, completely overpowering. The pieces here have a general theme, and that is the manipulation of the human voice. The opening title track mixes a banging piano loop with gorgeously rendered vocoder tones, conveying that peculiarly 1950s Disneyfied optimism about the happiness of a robotic future. ""Or Dor Melanor"" consists of a female voice singing the title's words laid next to some weirdly distant vocals processed into an ascending scale. ""Shepard Monde"" is a cracked assemblage of French syllables that sort of hangs together in a twitching clump, but the effect as it moves between the speakers evokes both mystery and profound beauty. ""De Planetarum Influxu"" mixes sine-wave squiggles and a deep drone with a mass of unclassifiable and machine-like voices that seem to be drifting steadily toward you, and then, at the moment when they could get no louder, the piece abruptly cuts off, ending the album on a jarring note. It all works together and there's not a dull patch on the record. The tracks without vocals mostly recall the kind of elemental electronic tinkering present on the earlier Bogner release, but in ever case the dusty electronic pulses are brought to life with a sense of rhythm, movement, and texture that can be easily connected to records like Jelinek's Kosmischer Pitch and Pekler's Cue. If this were a new album by either of them, it would be enjoyable and ultimately successful purely from a musical standpoint, but packaged as it is as part of the Bogner project, the music can't help but take on a different cast. If nothing else, Sonne = Blackbox is an excellent reminder of Jelinek's restless muse. He made a name with an unusual approach to sound developed during the IDM heyday of the 1990s and early 00s, but he's never stayed in one place long, and every project he's been involved with since offers an unfamiliar but ultimately rewarding world to be explored.","This is the second collection of music released under the name Ursula Bogner on the label of veteran electronic producer Jan Jelinek.

Ghostory,School of Seven Bells,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cb9d034d5c69bf4d7d/1:1/w_160/8a4df063.jpeg,2012-03-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16337-ghostory/,VagrantGhostly,"""Disconnect from desire"" is the sort of message usually encoded within salt-of-the-earth folk or new age unicorn fantasies, so it was easy to view School of Seven Bells' second album with suspicion. After all, its immaculate textures and brisk, glossy electro-pop are the kind you hear in moderately high-end clothing stores or spinning classes-- places where people reconnect with their need for quick fixes. But SVIIB's career to date has been a process of streamlining and economization: since their 2008 debut, Alpinisms, they've continuously pared down song length, sonic clutter, as well as personnel, and now on Ghostory, Alejandra Deheza and Ben Curtis come across like they've achieved a Zen sort of perfection as a duo. Whereas the sound they courted on Alpinisms intended to recreate the overwhelming physical bliss of shoegaze, Ghostory takes after a fundamental meditative tranquility, where thoughts and emotions are acknowledged as they pass through the calm without being judged as intrinsically good or bad. Though Ghostory claims a conceptual framework involving a ""young girl named Lafaye and the ghosts that surround her life,"" plainspoken song titles like ""Love Play"" and ""Show Me Love"" give you a fairly accurate survey of what to expect topically. And perhaps the departure of Deheza's sister Claudia from the fold resulted in SVIIB jettisoning the insular mysticism of old for intelligible emoting-- ""The light of day gives me no relief/Because I see you in everything,"" ""You take my love and leave me empty/ And all you feel is a fist of draining sand."" Those are the first lines on the first two songs, and Ghostory ultimately invests in the strange tension they achieve by Deheza's frictionless vocals. Though unerringly composed, Deheza doesn't sing with the brassy confidence of a pop star, but rather the steadiness of a surgeon-- ""this happened, here's how I feel,"" and melodies move straight and orderly, dots continuously connected. It uses the unease of romantic disturbance as some kind of baseline, breakups far enough in the past to allow perspective, but new loves never too new (oddly enough, this is the sort of mundane restlessness that triggers consumer culture). By Ghostory's end, Deheza coos, ""you kindle me, babe,"" but note she's not ablaze or smoldering. In short, recast most of Ghostory with acoustic guitars and suck out the aggressive beats and you might have something similar to an Imogen Heap or Dido record that might otherwise be off your radar until they get sampled by your favorite cloud rap producer. Or those ""comedown"" ballads that got stuck on Chemical Brothers albums with BPMs closer to their surroundings. Or, perhaps the club remixes of similarly prosaic love songs like Coldplay's ""Clocks"" or Sarah McLachlan's ""Sweet Surrender."" If you can't concede the awesomeness of those, then we're not gonna get very far here. If you can, Ghostory is at its best a very pleasurable realization of niche. ""The Night"" hurtles towards a chorus of Deheza repeating, ""devour me,"" with an inappositely chipper tone as 32nd-note hi-hats surround her like piranhas, while ""Love Play"" contrasts vocal shimmer with busily heaving bottom-end in case you've forgotten Curtis' former gig Secret Machines had one of the most righteously loud rhythm sections going. While those are distillation, ""Lafaye"" shows compositional advancement, initially sounding like wheelhouse SVIIB with its geysers of processed guitar distortion before a vowel-driven hook gets subtly recast in three ways-- at first in a striking but standard minor key, then as a major-key pivot and a more tonally ambivalent final chorus that releases its pent momentum. It's when they curb the momentum that Ghostory reveals its limitations: Without any percussive underpinning, ""Reappear"" and ""Show Me Love"" can't succeed in developing atmosphere, simply because you can't have atmosphere in an airlock. The overwhelming textural sterility brings to mind Curtis and Deheza's recording in the clinical white studio gracing the cover of the first Secret Machines record. Since Ghostory as a whole tries to present SVIIB as a scientific process, it's fitting that its last two tracks come off like a final synthesis. ""White Wind"" is SVIIB as a platonic ideal, Deheza achieving robotic actualization (indeed, the melodies are similar to that of a digital touch-tone) as Curtis and drummer Christopher Colley go nuts with percussive studio tricks.  All of which sets the band up for an ultimate date with destiny. While the breakbeat and honking synth riff of ""Bye Bye Bye"" inspired Amy Granzin to allude to the impact My Bloody Valentine's ""Soon"" had on Disconnect From Desire, I think she jumped the gun since Ghostory's eight-minute closer ""When You Sing"" is quite possibly the most blatant ""Soon"" homage in recorded history. Still, there's something actually quite charming about how overt their intentions are: If you've been called an electronic act and a shoegaze act and a dance act, ""Soon"" is your K2, and maybe that drum loop and cycle of gelatinous guitar chords are just public domain now, no different from a band of record collectors utilizing the ""Be My Baby"" drum intro or vinyl crackle to evoke a certain realm of emotions. It's crucial to acknowledge this crack in the veneer, since it's tough to think of SVIIB as being nerds of any type, having crushes on music or people. I suppose we should just come to an agreement that a record that doesn't explicitly tell you how to feel isn't necessarily doing something wrong, and make no mistake, SVIIB clearly know what they're after on Ghostory.  Maybe too much so, since the combination of protracted sterility and innate desire typically manifest in things like an oppressively planned Valentine's Day or one of those inner-peace retreats that cost a shitload of money. Those are the pretty, mixed messages that Ghostory sends.","Since their debut, School of Seven Bells have continuously pared down song length, sonic clutter, and personnel. On their third LP, the duo of Alejandra Deheza and Ben Curtis come across like they've achieved Zen perfection.

Sorrow and Extinction,Pallbearer,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d45e6ef95969322501/1:1/w_160/d64212bb.jpg,2012-03-01 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16345-sorrow-and-extinction/,Profound Lore,"Doom is a broad category, one of those descriptors that needs an extra word like ""stoner,"" ""funeral,"" ""sludge,"" ""death,"" or ""drone"" to help narrow things down a little. It can bring to mind the slower, low-tuned psychedelic metal of post-Sabbath American groups like Saint Vitus, Trouble, and Pentagram along with Sweden's Candlemass, UK act Cathedral, and descendants who are crustier (YOB, Asunder), more flatlining (Sunn O)))), seemingly suicidal (Loss), and exceedingly smoked-up (Sleep). Then come the backward-glancing modern traditionalists like weathered North Carolina crew Hour of 13, Rhode Island upstarts Pilgrim, and now, even more gloriously, Pallbearer. The Little Rock, Ark., quartet sounds much older than its years on its fantastic debut LP, Sorrow and Extinction. The band released a three-song demo in 2010, but reach greater heights here, due to both sharper songwriting and better production. Really, even though they end their Sorrow thank-you list with a blushing ""and, of course, Black Sabbath,"" they go much deeper than that. You could throw in Saint Vitus and early Candlemass (1986's Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, especially), but it almost makes more sense to reference post-Sleep duo Om for the way each song insistently, specifically reaches for a focused transcendence. That said, there's more variation and catharsis here, despite the occasional Mick Barr/all-nighter riffing. It seems like a simple formula, and maybe it is, but the execution's flawless. It also shifts subtly and continually: They mix in psychedelia, 1970s prog melodies, clean vocal harmonies, and ambient keyboards without sacrificing a certain smoked-up genre purity. We get five songs in just under 50 minutes, each mountain of slow, majestic chords bleeding into one glorious cathedral of riffs and soaring vocals. Here is where their insistence on an overall flow pays off. The longest and best piece is the scene-setting opener, ""Foreigner"". It starts with tentative, pretty nylon-stringed acoustic guitars that, after two minutes, are joined by carefully played, delicate drums until everything crashes with a huge distorted crescendo. The riffs are beautiful and memorable, somehow both gentle and crushing, but the real key here is vocalist (and guitarist) Brett Campbell, who I first heard via his soaring (and surprising) guest spot on Loss' beautifully bleak 2011 collection, Despond, an album that more usually features a guttural vocal gargle. That contrast is an essential aspect of the band, which is why when we posted an ""An Offering of Grief"", I mentioned the Pallbearer featured ""[a] vocalist who sings."" Campbell has been described as a young Ozzy Osbourne, and that influence is certainly there, but imagine if a young Ozzy had the ability to transform into Geddy Lee. This is music that would be interesting as instrumentals-- the guitars are that good-- but when you add a singer who can match that kind of dynamic surge, it goes somewhere else entirely. The songs have room to be extra patient in part because Pallbearer possess this weapon. On ""Given to the Grave"", for instance, we get more than five minutes of the acoustic strumming before the crunch and an ever-escalating Campbell. There's no need to rush when the climaxes are that huge, and with his voice, there's always one new wrinkle on the horizon. The clean, anthemic feel is reminiscent of 40 Watt Sun's 2011 LP, The Inside Room. That band features vocalist and guitarist Patrick Walker of the 1990s UK doom group Warning taking five songs to just about 50 minutes, but with a more obviously introspective feel than we have here-- The Inside Room's an apt title-- with moments that feel a bit like slowcore heroes Codeine. Sorrow and Extinction isn't first-person in that way, and it's more clearly metal: This is sweeping, outdoor, mountaintop music. The lyrics have a mannered, sword-and-sorcery feel, situating death and sadness in towers, pyres, journeys, and the ancients; but even if you don't follow along with what the songs ""mean,"" Campbell has one of those deliveries that brings shivers regardless of what he's singing. That's the other thing that sets Pallbearer apart: As ""down"" and death-focused as the words and band name might be, this is uplifting stuff. (When the overlapping solos and subtle, arcing synth haze of ""Given to the Grave"" bring Sorrow and Extinction to an ecstatic end, you'll be thinking more about life than death, believe me.) Ultimately, it feels like Pallbearer have created their own version of a traditional jazz funeral march, or like they went ahead and invented some sort of ""celebratory doom."" Whatever you want to call it, the record's a triumph.","The debut album by this young doom metal outfit from Arkansas is startlingly well realized, with deep, sludgy guitar textures and proggy songs that are complemented by a sparkling melodic sensibility.

When You're Gone EP,Lapalux,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c05e6ef959693224da/1:1/w_160/49c7ca39.jpeg,2012-02-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16329-when-youre-gone-ep/,Brainfeeder,"Brainfeeder kingpin Flying Lotus has a talent for stargazing. The label's ranks include jazz fusionists (Thundercat, Austin Peralta), psych-rap futurists (Samiyam, Teebs), and the endearingly inscrutable (Matthewdavid) existing together in dazzling constellation. But when Baths signed to Anticon, Brainfeeder lost their experimental pop artist, the kind of producer who could marry head-swiveling beats to ghostly vocals. Consider that niche filled. Lapalux, aka Stuart Howard, makes a similar type of sparkling deconstructed pop. He fits the Brainfeeder aesthetic perfectly, as he likes to envision his songs as aural paintings-- a visual tie-in obviously appealing to a synaesthete like FlyLo. Lapalux's snares first started snapping on his remix of Thundercat's ""For Love I Come"". Suddenly, a relatively straightforward love song turned fuzzy and discombobulated, as if the track had been put on small wheels and spun around a room until it was too dizzy to keep its parts in order. The Essex native's aesthetic has advanced on the When You're Gone EP. The tracks sound like amniotic imaginings of more accessible songs: all parts present but re-arranged with avant-garde abandon. The structure of ""102 Hours of Introductions"" is practically non-existent on first listen: gliding with faint keys and a wispy voice, as though Howard's setting up the listener for a massive drop. Instead, the beat is disarmingly light, softly swathed in a vocal that repeats ad infinitum: ""I've been waiting so long. Give your love to me, baby."" For a label that's made its name on galvanizing the spare parts of hip-hop, soldering them into novel formations, and blasting that formation into the stratosphere, When You're Gone is surprisingly needy. But that's the point of Brainfeeder: Expectations are expected to be upended. Lapalux's specialty is fusing the label's sense of meticulous beatcraft to tease out the meanings behind the sampled lyrics. ""Moments"" begins with a lyricist languidly confessing: ""I keep moments of you trapped in film."" As the song unfurls, the singer's utterings become swamped in sonic ooze, mirroring the song's theme. The effect is jarring, and at the song's conclusion, he cuts through the sentimentality, warping the moment that the singer once deeply treasured. But it's not all dark. The best songs, the bewitching single ""Gutter Glitter"" and stuttering disco workout ""Yellow 90's"", are lithe and light. The former starts with an elliptical loop but quickly skitters into a James Blake-like R&B track-- a voice hovering above buzzing bass and fluttering synths. Howard acts as a conductor here, demanding that specific sections express themselves with more volume. ""Yellow 90's"" seems the most traditionally ordered and even veers toward danceable. Yet once you're locked in the groove, the chair is removed and the song unravels. However, the song stays afloat, ending on a patch of gorgeous haze and a delirious lingering confusion. Howard's Brainfeeder debut shatters expectations, offering an always shifting balance of alien and familiar. It's not perfect. The closer, ""Face Down, Eyes Shut"", tries so hard to be enigmatic that it dissolves into nothing. But more often, When You're Gone reveals a stunning beauty within its small moments.","UK producer Stuart Howard's Brainfeeder debut offers sparkling pop deconstructed with avant-garde abandon.

"Beard, Wives, Denim",Pond,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cf13d197565213a9da/1:1/w_160/ba0fdb84.jpeg,2012-02-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16340-pond-beard-wives-denim/,Modular,"More often than not, most side-projects and spin-off bands don't spin very far from their respective musical mothership. Take the charmingly shambling Pond, a psych-rocking Australian three-piece that shares two members with Tame Impala, the psych-rocking Australian four-piece responsible for 2010's terrific Innerspeaker. That debut put a revisionist spin on guitar-driven psychedelia so much so that, unlike other bands mining for retrograded, kaleidoscopic gold, Innerspeaker felt beholden to no specific time or place. So it's with Beard, Wives, Denim that Tame Impala alumni Nick Allbrook and Jay Watson (here with Joseph Ryan) give the same kind of sounds and textures a more worldly setting with Pond. This album may not deviate much from the Tame Impala playbook (and, as sort of a guiding principal, trades the sheer scope of that record in for something more organic), but instead welcomingly recontextualizes that sound while offering it in easily digestible bites. Recorded in a ""ramshackle old farmhouse in Western Australia"" over two weeks back in 2010, Beard, Wives, Denim feels like some very capable musicians getting back to their play-it-loose-and-fast roots. The communal, freewheeling looseness is one of the album's greatest assets, as you feel as if you were a party to the making of the record in Eagle Bay, too. This is obviously not a record meant to transport you to anywhere except the small little universe in which it was created, helpfully buoyed by a genuine sense of good humor, evidenced by the press release's silly accompanying track notes (""Nick B slept for upwards of thirty hours, becoming the human-koala"") and the odd stitch of audio caught while the tape was still running. ""That was pretty shit, that one,"" a voice notes amid laughter at the end of ""Dig Brother"". Nothing here could be classified as being pretty shit, but at almost an hour there's certainly some trimming that could've been done. ""Tangent-heavy"" seems like a more appropriate criticism. But brevity clearly isn't the aim: Beard, Wives, Denim exists and works in very much the same way a high school battle of the bands would, where whichever band can wedge a freaked out, three-minute improv into a perfectly fine two minute pop song will probably lay claim to the prize. Despite the fact that said pop songs are mostly used as vessels, there sure are some pretty sweet ones here. As opener ""Fantastic Explosion of Time"" suggests with its deliciously warped take on the British Invasion, there isn't much mystery to where these songs' influences sprung from. Like Tame Impala, Pond's genre sampling feels authentic under the canopy of an established sound, with odes to swaggering 1970s cock-rock (""Moth Wings""), twist-n-shout good vibes (""Leisure Pony""), and some relatively bluesy shit-kicking western wanderers (""Elegant Design""). All would make fine singles, if only it weren't for the jammed-out extentions and loose-limbed codas that each song eventually falls subject to. Most of the detours are massively fun, like the immersion-blender-to-the-dome shred fest that intersects ""Sun and Sea and You"", and the terrific little details tucked into just-okay tunes, like the desert mirage guitars on ""Mystery"". Getting a little lost along the way, it would seem, is kind of the point. It may be unfair to compare Pond to Tame Impala too much, but when a band like the former's shadow looms so long, it's difficult not to. And in instances where Pond get a little too comfortable, focusing intently on the kind of horizon-gazing slow-bloomers that Tame Impala manage to render so elegantly, you may find your skip-button finger itching. More at fault might be Pond themselves, who are clearly very good at nailing tracks with a best-of-both-worlds approach, fusing those indulgent chunks of far-outness with fundamentally solid rock'n'roll tunes. And thanks to the communal tack, none of these ideas were given much time to stagnate. So it's hard to complain when the trips in between take a little longer than expected. But if your guy happens to have some of that high-test left, and you've got a little time tucked away, you're going to be just fine.","Sharing two members with Tame Impala, this Australian psych trio blends indulgent chunks of far-outness with fundamentally solid rock'n'roll tunes.

The Keychain Collection,Gang Colours,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cd13d197565213a9d2/1:1/w_160/75fef9ba.jpeg,2012-02-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16338-the-keychain-collection/,Brownswood,"You don't have to listen very closely to tell that Gang Colours' debut album is a Brownswood album through-and-through. Composed of soft vocals, grand piano, and subtle electronic elements, it's a dead ringer for Gilles Peterson's label's typical sound. What makes Will Ozanne slightly different is that he takes away both the usual acid-jazz and soul undertones and replaces them with a stone-faced funereality that brings him closer to James Blake than anything else. In fact, given Ozanne's remarkable vocal similarity to Blake, it's easy to see The Keychain Collection as a sort of alternate-universe James Blake, a collection of half-written piano chamber-pop trifles, only without all the defiantly fucked electronic manipulation. Opener ""Heavy Petting"" lays it all out nicely: pitched-down vocal samples, gently submerging basslines, artificial percussion, and various gasps of silvery synth map out a backdrop behind Ozanne's breathy whispers. It has all the low-end physicality of bass music, but it's meted out with the care and caution of cocktail-lounge fare, a paradoxical combination that both endows Keychain Collection with a sort of languid torpor but also raises it above just another album of chillout electronica. He does get more assertive occasionally: The wildly panning, crushed-frequency drums on ""To Repel Ghosts"" add much-needed grit to the wandering piano, while the sonorous *Plans-*era Death Cab-isms of ""Pebble Dash"" are saved by woozy chords and strange bleeping noises. Keychain Collection is primarily a record built on those little details: A casual perusal reveals some distantly pretty piano melodies, but listen closer and something like ""Tissues & Fivers"" is an elegant watercolor of textural intricacy and contrast, turning that single piano motif into something dynamic and transformative, while ""I Don't Want You Calling"" throws raucous Pearson Sound-like drum machine samples onto a plaintive backing track, erecting a twisting rhythmic skeleton out of pretty much nothing. Even if it's hard to escape how much Ozanne sounds like James Blake on the vocal tracks, it's this sort of intimate exactitude of production that separates him from his ostensible peer. Normally a perfectly trained ear breeds stuffiness and rigidity, but here it works in Ozanne's favor. ""Fancy Restaurant"" is built around a single, endlessly repeated vocal phrase, constructed from all the same elements as the rest of the album-- brushed drums and flinty synths-- but Ozanne's gorgeous piano melody tumbles through the gauntlet of electronic noises gracefully, like water trickling down a knotted cliff face. It's the album's most addictive song and one of its unashamedly simplest, proving that even if Gang Colours can be reduced to a formula, it's at the least a highly enjoyable one. The Keychain Collection is the kind of album likely to be eaten up by the sort of casual electronic music fan who devours the rest of the Brownswood catalog. Let's be honest with ourselves: This is pretty much coffee-shop fare. But it's smart, clever coffee-shop fare, with enough substance and and detail to stand on its own two feet, however dainty they might be. It's not a record that's going to hit you over the head-- it's almost fatally unassuming and more likely to meekly ask if you maybe wanted to spare a few seconds to listen-- but it's one that will offer a surprising amount of replay value if you accept its coy, hesitant invitation.","On his debut, Will Ozanne combines the low-end physicality of bass music with the care and caution of cocktail-lounge fare.

Vee Vee (Remastered),Archers of Loaf,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c65e6ef959693224e7/1:1/w_160/9821c55b.jpeg,2012-02-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16333-vee-vee/,MergeFire,"If you caught me at the right time during the early part of the last decade, you may remember me as The Guy Who Would Argue That Archers of Loaf Were Better Than Pavement. I developed this position at a time when it was useful to a have a Thing and for that Thing to kindle debate. Garden-variety contrarianism? A little, but I was a liberal arts major on a Midwestern state university campus, and for the first time in my life the most cred-heavy rocker in the immediate vicinity. There was hot indie truth to be spoken to power. In head Loafer Eric Bachmann, I'd found my wingman: Here was a guy who gave zero fucks, one who came from an era in which the appropriate response to a buzzstrong debut was to retreat to your undersized Cali label and record an album about just how full of shit everyone is, yourself included. That album was 1995's Vee Vee. It arrived after Icky Mettle, the debut that saw AoL emerge as underground heroes during a period that also saw their home base-- Chapel Hill, North Carolina-- championed as a launching pad, like a Brooklyn that someone had papered over with dogwoods. The band probably bristles at the Pavement comparison above, but the liner notes to this reissue contrast the bands, and the Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain reissue jokes of an upcoming book titled Better Than Archers of Loaf: Pavement for Dummies (imagine me upon its release, red-faced amidst my college newspaper colleagues). The Loaf started out as affable goofballs with a penchant for scene politics. When they returned with Vee Vee, they were changed. Suddenly brawny and ill-tempered, they sounded upset. I was too young to catch Vee Vee's bluster, but like holiday tunes and odes to cities, songs about ""the scene"" are evergreen. So I was scribbling lines like, ""The underground is overcrowded,"" and, ""It's too bad that your music doesn't matter,"" in spiral notebooks years after they'd arrived, years before I might have embarrassed a future self with them on Facebook. Vee Vee is a particular kind of screed, one that is as smart and accurate as it is angry and self-destructive. It's also funny as hell: Run Bachmann up against whichever lampooner you think has indie culture by the balls and see who comes out ahead. (I'll submit this line, from ""Death in the Park"": ""It's always the same people/ Pissing the same people off."") Vee Vee might just have easily been reissued with a Blogspot/Tumblr doublepack instead of the traditional collector-detritus disc two. Fortunately, Bachmann's well-honed bark serves as a base to all his acid. It never sounded better than on bloody-chin classics like ""Harnessed in Slums""-- a college radio smash-- and ""Fabricoh"". The best of the second disc-- ""Telepathic Traffic"", ""Bacteria""-- don't add to the band's legacy so much as remind how pleasant it is to be yelled at by Bachmann. He has a way of laughing at his peers, his audience, and himself without seeming dickish. On ""Fabricoh"" and ""Underdogs of Nipomo"" he plays vocal Tetris, stacking phrases into solid walls, missing often enough to leave holes. The band, too, was never stronger or more pungent. The guitars do that distinctly mid-1990s indie thing in which notes bend or dissipate before phrases finish. On the slow-swinging chorus of ""Floating Friends"" they vine upward and offer a prettiness rare to this band. The everyman rhythm section is drunk, but only a little. When the group distills Bachmann's derision into a mild torpor on ""Greatest of All Time"", the Loaf sound like the only band on the planet smart enough not to apply for the title. The remastering here is nice even if Vee Vee always sounded great. The second disc drags on several early demos but is a valuable archive (splitting hairs: The band's best-ever non-album material, Vs. The Greatest of All Time EP, belongs here spiritually, sonically, and chronologically but was sacrificed to the Icky Mettle reissue). AoL reached their greatest heights on Vee Vee, but it's also the album where they overplayed their hand. Indie rock deserves to be clowned as hard and as often as anything, but when you reach the point where you're screaming ""Nostalgia!"" at your audience, or towing around the flatulent ""Underachievers March and Fight Song"", you might just need a vacation. Bachmann wasn't a prophet or a culture vulture. I think he was a smart guy who made smart observations about things that irked him, but his cynicism corroded Vee Vee. On songs like ""The Worst Has Yet to Come"", I can hear Bachmann convincing himself that his position is untenable. The first line of that song is, ""We're on the outside/ And we're all making fun of you."" This level of bitterness can seem the Truth, but it takes so much energy; Vee Vee is as wearying as it is incisive. By the time I was actually listening to this music, Bachmann had gravitated toward the quotidian concerns of the American songbook with Crooked Fingers. Vee Vee's humor, commentary, and song-by-song knockout punches make that energy seem worthwhile. As when the biggest guy in the bar has your back, Vee Vee is filled with extra spittle and bottomless bravado. When I want to laugh at, scream at, or revel in indie rock's existence, Vee Vee is what I reach for, and Bachmann is still the guy I want on my side.","Seventeen years after its release, Archers of Loaf's sophomore album gets reissued as a 2xCD collection, remastered by original producer Bob Weston, and including 16 bonus tracks, liner notes, and new cover art.

How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?,Sinéad O'Connor,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cec0084474cd0c21a9/1:1/w_160/76292219.jpeg,2012-02-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16339-how-about-i-be-me-and-you-be-you/,One Little Indian,"Always as much trainwreck as firebrand, Sinéad O'Connor has returned from relative obscurity with a fresh round of tabloid headlines. Her recent marriage nearly didn't last as long as Kim Kardashian's suspiciously short nuptials (though they later reconciled) and her drug problems proved more humiliating, albeit less damaging, than Lindsay Lohan's. And yet I'd argue that O'Connor's motivations are very different from those of her younger co-headliners, and that's before I heard the fame-is-bullshit anthem ""V.I.P."" that closes her latest album. For a quarter-century now, she's been a professional mess, with an often antagonistic attitude toward her audience and seemingly no self-censoring apparatus. When that outrage fueled her music, the mess could be fascinating, but when it inspired albums of big-band or reggae numbers, the mess was tedious, tiring, alienating, self-sabotaging. But lately it's been mostly heartbreaking, with an ill-fated marriage, a bad drug buy, and reports of suicide attempts exposing the increasingly frayed lines between her public and private personas. How About I Be Me (And You Be You)? might seem self-exploitive if it didn't so thoroughly comment on and confound her recent controversies, or if the songs didn't sound like they emanate from the same place as her romantic catastrophes. It's been ages since O'Connor's music so perfectly reflected her struggles, and about as long since she's released an album quite so devastating. In truth, these songs are actually a bit unwieldy and occasionally ugly, as she relies so relentlessly on rudimentary rhyme schemes and clunky lyrics. Such flaws are all the more apparent given the diligent unobtrusiveness of the solemn piano chords and trenchant guitar strums. But the lyrical coarseness serves an important function, reinforcing the urgency of O'Connor's performances and creating the impression that she has worked hard and fast to document her emotions at their rawest and wildest. These songs don't sound like they were written; they sound like they were scrawled in a shaky but determined hand. The album doesn't start at a place of devastation, but with a sweetly sincere declaration of love and commitment. Against a rhythmic acoustic strum that gently mimics a hip-hop beat, ""4th and Vine"" captures the excitement of new love and the invigoration of devoting yourself to another person, and O'Connor's voice, which conveys rage so perfectly, is soft, even playful. Of course, it doesn't work out-- not in real life and not in the narrative of the album. What follows that first burst of contentment is a bleak psychological portrait of the artist as lover, mother, and public figure, and the dark depths of these songs only make the exuberance of ""4th and Vine"" all the more harrowing. On the next song, O'Connor steps into the perspective of a junkie on ""Reason With Me"", and the parallels between the character's problems and herself are obvious: ""If I loved someone, I might lose someone."" Perhaps the best song here is dedicated to her youngest son. On ""I Had a Baby""-- which is as straightforward as that title suggests-- she wonders how to tell her child that he was born out of wedlock, the result of an affair with a married man. But her caustic despair springs not from her anger with the father but with her own powerlessness to protect her child from this sad predicament. In most cases, we as listeners and especially as critics are supposed to keep the art separate from the artist, to avoid letting real-life events shade the music with too much meaning or context. With How About I Be Me, however, that's impossible, not simply because her failed marriage is too fresh in our memory, but because O'Connor doesn't let herself or her listeners make such tidy distinctions. What to make, then, of the fact that the most embittered track here is not an O'Connor original, but a cover of a track by John Grant?

The End of That,Plants and Animals,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a5c0084474cd0c216d/1:1/w_160/5e45c1bc.jpeg,2012-02-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16309-the-end-of-that/,Secret City,"No matter where Plants and Animals went on their first two LPs, they always came bearing good vibes: If Arcade Fire had set out to make Barbecue instead of Funeral, it might've sounded like the trio's 2008 debut, Parc Avenue, perhaps the last hurrah of shambling, collectivist Canadian indie rock as we came to know it last decade. And while follow-up La La Land traded the requisite Montreal orchestration for Hollywood namedrops (""Tom Cruz"", ""American Idol"", ""Kon Tiki""), there was a still a Lebowski-like insouciance to it, a projection from a place where beards and beer flowed equally free. Point being I never thought that whether Plants and Animals were good dudes was up for debate, but while The End of That doesn't go too far beyond the La La Land DMZ between indie folk and jam-band, they've got some dark and heavy shit on their minds this time out-- they attempt to take unsparing inventory, offer sincere amends, and confront the responsibilities of adulthood. But the unyielding geniality of the music and slackjawed lyrics show a band either unwilling or unable to commit to its own emotional ballast or offer a sense of real stakes, the result of which is The End of That confusing a bummy hangover with a full-blown existential crisis. In a vacuum, it's admirable that Plants and Animals are finding inspiration in a life pivot that doesn't get much play in rock music: The characters in these songs are still partying and waking up on friends' couches, only now they come to while their buddy's wife is making breakfast for the kids. That's essentially the lyrical thread running through the title track, ""Crisis!"", and ""No Idea"", the three songs here which most explicitly delineate the titular catch-all of ""that."" On ""The End of That"", Warren Spicer admits, ""I tried the cocaine just to know what it could do/ I had to try it again just to give it a second chance,"" and the mundanity of it is actually rather bold for a topic that often results in exploitative oversharing or impenetrable metaphor. But as soon as you want to pull up to Spicer's barstool, he loses the plot, referring to an object of affection as a ""fucked-up bumblebee/ Headed for the potpourri,"" and continuing to spit game from there: ""You turn me on so with your bee-sting lips/ And your pepper-grinder hips/ Like a thread in the needle/ We're just typical people/ We're hoping to be friends and do cool stuff and be equal."" It's frankly pretty impressive how many different linguistic devices are used for the same cringeworthy effect. And that's generally how most of The End of That goes, getting in a totally sincere and totally awkward sentiment before Spicer's lyrics perilously tailspin over endless Stones-y vamps. While the tone of the lyrics and music are jarringly discordant, the compositional methods for both align all too perfectly. ""Crisis!"" serves as the literal and figurative centerpiece of The End of That, a sloppy lanyard of guitar and vocal threads that barely tries for melodic structure and lyrics that similarly favor first-take immediacy. ""Well holy matrimony!/ Everyone is gettin' married or breaking up/ And the stroller situation on the sidewalk is way out of control,"" Spicer sings, and like so much of the record, it initially sounds plainspoken and charming until you realize absolutely nobody talks like that. Preceded by a false count-off and some friendly studio chatter, everything is arranged so that you have no reason whatsoever to think ""Crisis!"" wasn't actually made up completely on the spot. And as these things usually turn out, it's the longest song on The End of That, even more forbidding back to back with the equally aimless six minutes of ""2010"". Occasionally, as on solemn opener ""Before"" and the driving, minor-key ""Control Me"", there's enough drawn shades obscuring the sunlight so that intent and execution can properly parallel, and with Spicer's voice bearing a similar grain to Nash Kato, they hint at Urge Overkill's genuinely despairing Exit the Dragon. But for a record that sounds like memories of better times, there's a disheartening shortage of hooks or melodies that aren't hitched to lyrics you'd rather forget: ""Lightshow"" has a spunky riff but never advances past it, while Spicer barges into a McCartney-styled piano progression on ""No Idea"", asking, ""Do you fear loneliness?/ Do you fear getting left behind?/ All your friends are getting married/ They're having... a time."" Look, kudos to Plants and Animals for intervening on themselves without the help of the local authorities or concerned family members, but whether it's the trailer preview-friendly bop of the music, the utter lack of palpable conflict, or the stilted dialogue and shoulder-shrugging catchphrases, I can't shake the feeling that The End of That is ultimately a Matthew McConaughey character come to life.","On their third LP, the Montreal indie rock trio attempt to take unsparing inventory, offer sincere amends, and confront the responsibilities of adulthood.

TRST,Trust,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d113d197565213a9dd/1:1/w_160/88044c99.jpeg,2012-02-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16342-trst/,Arts & Crafts,"When looking at what we know about Trust, the electro-goth duo of Robert Alfons and Austra's Maya Postepski, the comparisons to Crystal Castles aren't just obvious, they beg to be highlighted. Both groups are from Toronto, both are press-averse man-woman duos, and both draw from nasty-sounding synthesizers and the 1980's for musical inspiration. Just as Crystal Castles have found themselves at the middle of fair-use controversies, Trust could be accused of copying the copiers themselves: Last year's single on Sacred Bones, ""Bulbform"", reappears on the duo's debut LP, TRST, and its trance-y backing melody bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Baptism"", the five-alarm steamroller of a tune featured on Crystal Castles' second self-titled album from 2010. I'm willing to write it off as coincidence-- not just because Crystal Castles didn't write the e-book when it comes to specific synth patterns. Whereas that band's punkish, neck-whipping performances suggest music designed to be enjoyed in a communal, sweaty setting, Trust's music sounds introverted by comparison. The missing letter in the album title is ""U"", and it's fitting; TRST often sounds like Alfons and Postepski are doing this more for themselves than anyone else, with synth melodies that yo-yo into the unknown and atmospherics that change from warm to coruscating with the turn of a phrase. Even the most ""single""-ready material here-- ""Dressed for Space"", ""Sulk"", ""Chrissy E""-- carries a drug-sick lurch, somewhat akin to trying to make your way out of a dark club and your own head simultaneously. A fair amount of TRST is cut from the same cloth as the brittle, gloomy melodrama of coldwave, but Alfons and Postepski's music does more than just flirt with analog affectations. Last year, NYC coldwave duo Xeno & Oaklander brought swarming lushness to the genre with Sets & Lights; comparatively, Trust take their own extraordinary machines and slather them in gloss, resulting in the sonic equivalent of what a fashion show might look like if it were put on by depressive pill abusers. This stuff sounds malevolent, but mighty sexy, as Alfons' pinched whine of a voice takes on both characteristics with ease. About that voice: Like so much of TRST, it's not exactly for everyone. At his most accessible, Alfons sounds like a reedier, less faddish version of Interpol's Paul Banks, while elsewhere, he ribbits and warbles in various keys-- as one colleague has put it, like a goth version of Eeyore. Personally, I quite like Alfons' voice; it has a slithering, grimy quality to it that increases the raunch-factor on particularly dirty-sounding tracks like ""Shoom"" and ""Bulbform"", and when he struts his stuff on ""Sulk"" and ""Dressed for Space"", he sounds like the kind of personality-heavy singer indie culture's been hesitant to embrace over the last few years. (He also outperforms Postepski's few vocal takes on TRST, which range from brief, throaty bursts to flatlined vocalizing.) Despite the fact that moody, goth-flecked synth-pop has been in vogue for the larger part of a decade now, ""unique"" fits TRST like a leather face mask. Despite the fact that Trust's band bio is roughly the length of a couple of Tweets, it doesn't sound like Alfons and Postepski are hiding behind anything; instead, they wear their affectations proudly, exercising a frequent willingness for weirdness. Also, there are just so many bands using synths these days-- but how many of them are making their synths sound this rich and room-filling? TRST is not a brief album-- it stops just short of an hour in length-- and while the amount of raw material here may be daunting for some, there are plenty of surprising melodic moments to indulge in, from the gorgeous melodic drop that takes place midway through ""Shoom"" to all six-and-a-half minutes of ""Sulk""'s sighing pop majesty. If you can't decide whether to mope or dance to this stuff, how about you do both at the same time-- with the lights off, please.","On their rich, room-filling debut, the Toronto electro-goth duo of Robert Alfons and Austra's Maya Postepski make malevolent, sexy synth-pop.

A Victim of Stars: 1982-2012,David Sylvian,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c59d034d5c69bf4d72/1:1/w_160/95082065.jpeg,2012-02-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16332-a-victim-of-stars-1982-2012/,Virgin,"David Sylvian's voice bears such a calmly forceful cadence, full of carefully enunciated words that trail off into a pristine nasal murmur, that he can dart between genres and surface with music positioned resolutely in his own sound world. The former Japan singer has spent a great deal of time reflecting on his solo output in recent times. In 2010 he released a retrospective of his non-album collaborative work, Sleepwalkers. If that record was a treat for fans, A Victim of Stars feels like a crack opening in the door for anyone left behind, a way to get a feel for Sylvian's far-reaching mood swings since Japan disbanded in 1982. It's neatly ordered, beginning with a hint of the early trappings of his solo career via a version of his former band's ""Ghosts""; taking in a smattering of material from his full-length albums; and closing with a new song bearing a title that summarizes the divisive areas of exploration that break-up his career arc: ""Where's Your Gravity?"" Sylvian's voice is a unique beast, pitched somewhere between the type of feigned disinterest typical of all the Ferry and Bowie acolytes the New Romantic movement produced, but with greater cracks and world weariness appearing with age. By the time A Victim of Stars lands on ""Small Metal Gods"" from 2009's excellent Manafon, there's a buckle and strain to his singing, a distinct warble in his throat, a palpable swoop down toward earthier terrain. But it's still grounded in the unreal, demonstrating Sylvian's preference for keeping his audience at arm's length. If there's one element of style that remains in place on this compilation, it's the tendency to untether his voice, to leave it floating in space, while the instrumentation-- sometimes fussy, sometimes so minimal it's barely a whisper-- politely searches for space around it, as though the singer is performing an awkward first dance with his own work. Dialing back from ""Small Metal Gods"" to the material from 1984's Brilliant Trees is like taking a leap from someone at peace with their place on the planet to someone still figuring out who they are. But even the shift from ""Pulling Punches"" to ""The Ink in the Well"" (the first two tracks from Trees) is substantial, with the former all 1980s lipstick traces and watery slap bass, while the latter is sunk in a bed of acoustic thrumming and gently brushed drums. Both are perfect ease-in access points to Sylvian's solo work and among the best-known material here. But a better early warning of what was to come is ""Forbidden Colours"", Sylvian's 1983 collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto. It's a fully formed piece of orchestral pop, with Sylvian taking on the mantle of wraithlike torch singer-- the vantage point from which he's clearly most comfortable as a performer. One of Sylvian's biggest detours from that mode of operation was Secrets of the Beehive (1987), a largely acoustic-driven work represented by a clutch of songs here. On ""Waterfront"" from that album it's easy to detect the Scott Walker influence that continually reemerges in his career, while ""Let the Happiness In"" is the kind of low-key, jazz-inflected ballad that would fit easily into Mark Hollis' solitary solo album. Fellow outliers such as Walker and Hollis are the kind of company Sylvian has comfortably kept throughout his solo work, and, like them, he has often deviated tangentially in pursuit of untried provinces; Secrets of the Beehive was followed by two protracted instrumental collaborations with members of Can, Plight & Premonition (with Holger Czukay) and Flux and Mutability (again with Czukay, along with Jaki Liebezeit, Marcus Stockhausen, and Michael Karoli). It would have been difficult to bring in such work on A Victim of Stars, on account of the sheer length of the material in those collaborations. As such, it's important to note this is only a small part of Sylvian's story, a few splintered factions that hint at fuller, more expansive stories told elsewhere on his full-length recordings. But as a handhold into those tales this works surprisingly well, occasionally even dipping into the uninhibited environments Sylvian likes to extend to, such as the subdued funk of the nine-and-a-half-minute opener to 1999's Dead Bees on a Cake, ""I Surrender"". It also highlights his immaculate taste in collaborators, with earlier work alongside Sakamoto and Robert Fripp complemented by Blemish-era compositions marked by the spooked-out electronics of Christian Fennesz and Derek Bailey's guitar passages. The ghostlike curls of feedback on ""Late Night Shopping"" from that record are the perfect place to drop Sylvian's voice, where his tenderly accented tones lightly vacillate between calm and disquiet. Sylvian's partnership with Fennesz now stretches over a number of recordings, with both clearly sharing an appreciation for abstraction in art. It's an impulse that loops back to the earliest song present here, ""Ghosts"", which fleetingly lapses into glitch-heavy electronics at crucial junctures in its evolution. It's not easy to string a single narrative from A Victim of Stars-- Sylvian's career is in a permanent state of flux and reinvention. But he works best when his songwriting is pulled away from the concrete, when there's open-endedness for him to spin his focus around. But nothing here is ever wholly drawn into that world. Sylvian's role often feels like that of a curator, tugging in elements of free improvisation but never letting it overshadow, lest his absorption with songcraft, opulent orchestration, ambient electronics, and dozens of other impulses suffer. A Victim of Stars doesn't offer much to anyone already immersed in that world. For everyone else this is an engaging scratch at the surface of a wide-open mind.","This engaging compilation of work by the former Japan vocalist begins begins with a version of a song from his old band, moves through material from his solo LPs, and closes with a new song.

The Slideshow Effect,Memoryhouse,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bcea9e61561daa6b3f/1:1/w_160/1d83f42f.jpeg,2012-02-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16326-memoryhouse-the-slideshow-effect/,Sub Pop,"The Ontario duo Memoryhouse began not as a band so much as an art project. Denise Nouvion was a photographer who took dreamy, spectral-haunted photographs, and Evan Abeele a music school grad with an equal love of neo-classical composers and My Bloody Valentine. After meeting through friends a few years ago, Nouvion and Abeele embarked on a collaboration: He composed minimalist instrumental tracks to soundtrack her short films and accompany her photo exhibits. At some point, though, Nouvion's plaintive, placid-lake vocals got added to the mix, Abeele started writing bridges and choruses, and Memoryhouse morphed into a full-fledged dream pop band. It's fitting, then, that the band's full-length debut, The Slideshow Effect, which they say refers to ""the photographic/cinematic technique of zooming and panning to animate still images"" (I guess The Ken Burns Effect lacked a certain poeticism), is scattered with pictures. In ""Bonfire"" Nouvion sings about throwing photos in a pool and, later, holding a print up to light to wistfully observe the fingerprints it bears, while on the gently melancholy ""Punctum"" she comes to a conclusion that will ring true to anyone who's ever fallen into a late-night abyss of Facebook photo flipping: ""It's not enough to live your past through photographs."" It's tempting-- given the band's creation story and the record's overall aesthetic-- to dismiss Memoryhouse as the ultimate example of a tumblr come to life and calling itself a rock band. (The cover, shot by Nouvion, doesn't help.) But a closer listen to The Slideshow Effect reveals that there's more to them than that: Unassuming as they occasionally feel, the tracks have a solid construction, visible through the fog-free clarity of Abeele and recently recruited bassist Barzin Hassani's production. Operating in a subgenre where every producer's M.O. seems to be ""I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more reverb,"" Memoryhouse's sound is refreshingly articulate. They're at their best when they kick up the tempo-- the bright, drum-machine sputter of ""The Kids Were Wrong"" is an early highlight-- though they don't seem to have realized this yet: The back half of the record sags with pleasant but near-indistinguishable slow jams such as ""Pale Blue"" and ""Kinds of Light"". Still, in its more compelling moments, The Slideshow Effect's overall vibe of glistening inertia isn't a strike against it, but rather an embodiment of its central theme. The album is a painstaking portrayal of the dissolution of a relationship, which makes its frozen, photogenic poses take on a kind of poignancy: Stay stock-still and everything will remain as it's always been; move a muscle and it all falls apart. Nouvion uses some variation of the phrase ""lie still"" at least half a dozen times. ""Go to sleep, nothing's changing,"" she sings with a potent twinge of self-denial on ""The Kids Were Wrong"", ""I'll be right here by your side."" Memoryhouse frequently get compared to Beach House, who explored similar themes on their magnificently gloomy 2010 album, Teen Dream. Memoryhouse have a ways to go before they're creating music with as much melodic power or depth of feeling as their dream-pop contemporaries. But as their development from the gallery to the stage has shown, there's every reason to believe that The Slideshow Effect is just a baby picture.","The Ontario dream-pop duo's full-length debut is a painstaking portrayal of the dissolution of a relationship.

Toward the Low Sun,Dirty Three,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ca5e6ef959693224f0/1:1/w_160/aae93f53.jpeg,2012-02-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16336-dirty-three/,Drag City,"Seven years is long enough for people to forget about you, but not quite long enough to cast your reunion as a victorious, back-from-the-dead surprise. Then again, Dirty Three didn't so much dramatically break up as simply run out of roads to travel. From 1993 to 2005, the band had pushed its minimal violin/guitar/drum set-up to epic extremes, from desert-storming ragers (1996's Horse Stories) to exquisitely melancholic meditations (1998's Ocean Songs) to Godspeed-sized pomp-rock spectacle (2000's Whatever You Love, You Are). But the Australian trio's last release, Cinder, felt like a conscious act of retreat, what with compact three-minute compositions and Cat Power cameos nudging their once-volatile sound toward NPR-friendly accessibility. But it's not as if Dirty Three have been spending the past seven years trying to refine and build upon Cinder's pop overtures; as Toward the Low Sun strongly suggests, it's just taken them that long to unlearn everything they've known before in an attempt to start anew. Of course, violinist Warren Ellis had a lot of practice in the deconstruction department during the intervening years, having reported back to active Bad Seeds duty for the especially sleazy Dig, Lazarus Dig!!!, while joining Nick Cave's even more depraved offshoot act Grinderman for a two-album skronk-rock joyride. So it's fitting that Toward the Low Sun's torrential opener, ""Furnace Skies"", sounds like it was recorded with Grinderman's still-warm equipment; it reintroduces us to Dirty Three mid-freakout, with ever-astounding drummer Jim White treating his snare drum like a machine-gunned target at a firing range, while Ellis and Mick Turner respectively poke through the percussive melee with teaser violin refrains and random shards of electric guitar. The appearance of a three-note Farfisa riff partway through introduces some semblance of shape to the piece, but ""Furnace Skies"" is essentially what you'd expect from a band that hasn't played together in several years: It's a warm-up exercise, an opportunity to get the limbs loosened, the blood pumping, and the instruments tuned. But it also sets you up for a big payoff that the rest of Toward the Low Sun isn't so keen to deliver. In recent interviews, Ellis has not been shy in admitting that Toward the Low Sun was a difficult album to make, delayed by false starts and aborted sessions and, as such, there's a hesitant feel to the recordings that more readily captures the sound of a band getting reacquainted rather than reinvigorated. Even on the tracks with more easily discernible forms-- like the countrified lope of ""Moon on the Land""-- Dirty Three prefer to drift along and let structure materialize by happenstance, rather than impose any predetermined script on the compositions, while songs that carry the suggestion of intensifying into something more powerful (""Rising Below"", ""The Pier"") pull back before they truly erupt. As a result, Toward the Low Sun is never so bold as to match the horsehair-raising crescendos of Dirty Three's early signature works, nor does it offer the melodic immediacy of Cinder. It's an album that presents a series of beautifully desolate valleys, but without the volcanic peaks to lend them a greater definition. It's tempting to view Toward the Low Sun as the sort of record that was sequenced according to the order the songs were recorded, as the performances grow markedly more assured and intuitive the deeper you venture into the collection. ""That Was Was"" provides a welcome jolt in the form of a grungy, ""Cortez the Killer""-style grind that showcases the delightfully nasty qualities of Ellis' fiddle, while the absolutely stunning ""Ashen Snow""-- guided by Turner's gentle piano melody and Ellis' beautifully mournful violin line-- affirms this band's ability to devastate even in the absence of their usual string-slashing, stage-stomping gestures. After an iffy start, Toward the Low Sun thankfully picks up a head full of steam in its closing stretch-- hopefully, this momentum won't dissipate over another seven-year layoff.","After a seven-year absence, the Australian minimal violin/guitar/drum trio of Warren Ellis, Mick Turner, and Jim White unlearn everything they've known before in an attempt to start anew.

Lupercalia,Patrick Wolf,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6d5e6ef95969321dce/1:1/w_160/1846ee8f.jpg,2011-06-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15492-lupercalia/,MercuryHideout,"""Songs about love are obviously the most common theme in pop music, but I wanted to approach it in a way that hadn't been done before. The title refers to the Lupercalia festival, which is the ancient fertility and love festival that happens around Valentine's Day. I strive to be original-- it's one of my biggest ambitions. There can be nothing worse sometimes than a soppy love record-- imagine if I'd called it To Love: Patrick Wolf!"" That's Patrick Wolf doing the heavy-lifting when it comes to pinpointing what went wrong with Lupercalia: It's clear he hasn't shaken off his artiste pretensions since the goth-folk of his early work, but ever since the career peak of 2005's shadowy song cycle Wind in the Wires, he seems to want pop stardom. And while the clash of those desires can lead to fascinating music, it rarely happens when the artist considers himself above pop music and its consumers. And unfortunately, much like he did on The Magic Position and The Bachelor, Wolf is operating like someone who doesn't trust his audience to think at his level, offering a subtly condescending record that leaves so little to the listener's imagination that it actually may as well have been called To Love: Patrick Wolf! At first glance, Wolf's headfirst dive into new romantic pop seemed like a good move. As with ""Accident & Emergency"" or ""The Magic Position"", Wolf put a good step forward on this album's lead single: ""The City"" remains an insistently kicky piece of kitsch, its cheeseball horn charts and can-do lyrics about love transcending material possession successfully recalling 80s new pop. But like ""The City""'s video-- Wolf frolicking on the Santa Monica pier with a bunch of Hollister ad types-- the rest of Lupercalia is self-aware in all but one crucial aspect,  the ability to recognize just how blatantly it allows itself to lay it on so thick. Far be it from me to deny someone the agency to make his ""happy"" record, but Wolf seems to feel as if self-consciousness grants him a license to go slumming in his most insipid songwriting impulses. The clincher from otherwise charming ""House"": ""This is the greatest peace I've ever known/ Only love makes a house a home."" Meanwhile, the lesson learned on  ""Together"" is ""and I can't do this alone/ But we can do this so much better together,"" the last word harmonized just so in case you didn't get the gist. Sure, it's awkward when he allows himself a little more poetic license on the string-choked ""Slow Motion"" (""before you I was living in a silverfish kitchen""), but at least it's a new way to make the same point. How the album manages to feel so impersonal is weird considering it was inspired by Wolf's recent engagement, but the smug piano narrative of ""Bermondsey Street"" feels stuck somewhere between ""Our House"" and ""Born This Way"". What's frustrating is that if you strip away the unctuous lyrical gaffes, Wolf gets most everything else right. During Lupercalia's first half, he continues to prove himself a fine craftsman of major-key melodies, and this is his most confident and convicted vocal performance yet. But like most of Wolf's records, he eventually gives into sad songs and waltzes as Lupercalia progresses, and studded with the same overproduction tricks of cluttered strings and processed samples, ""The Days"" and ""Slow Motion"" don't offer much in the way of contrast outside of tempo. Considering how intriguing it is to think about Wolf in the abstract-- undeniably talented and ambitious as he is-- there's no reason he shouldn't be some sort of star.  But his claims to originality feel increasingly misplaced-- he's not the only auteur combining glam-rock ambitions with sexually ambiguous theatrics these days, and compared to Of Montreal's confrontational eclecticism, Diamond Rings' nervy confessionals, and Lady Gaga's full-frontal multimedia bombast, the domesticated Wolf of Lupercalia can't help but sound tame.","Ambitious and heady as always, Patrick Wolf here takes a headfirst dive into new romantic pop.

Sun and Shade,Woods,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af77ea9e61561daa6465/1:1/w_160/3c896c1e.jpg,2011-06-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15499-sun-and-shade/,Woodsist,"When I first caught on to Woods with 2009's Songs of Shame, they'd already been around for a few years, releasing albums in limited editions, sometimes under the name Woods Family Creeps. Songs of Shame was immediately enjoyable, as it spun together strands of folk-rock, ramshackle indie, and sunshine pop into something that felt handmade and fresh. But listening to it, I didn't peg Woods as the kind of band that would keep turning out remarkably well-realized and consistent albums on a yearly basis. Maybe it was the casual nature of their time-keeping, where all the songs amble at a loose, oblong gait. Or maybe it was the general nature of their lo-fi pedigree, where quantity of output is often prized over quality. But nothing about Woods at that time said ""consistent album band"" to me. Two years and two full-lengths later, ""consistent album band"" describes Woods very well. Last year's At Echo Lake didn't have a weak song on it and showcased the strength of their songwriting on the most fundamental terms. I still find myself humming tunes from it at weird times, even when I haven't listened to it in months. Now they return with Sun and Shade, another very solid record that finds them returning in spots to the experimental vein explored on earlier records and in their live show. They haven't changed their sound in the least, but they're demonstrating that there's a lot more to be done with it than might have been expected. The experimentation comes in the form of two longer instrumentals that take up about 17 of the album's 44 minutes. ""Out of the Eye"" is a Krautrock homage constructed from the basic ingredients of Neu!'s ""Hallogallo"", but slowed down by a third and with a Middle Eastern tinge in the guitars. Where bands like Stereolab built something driving and forceful around the iconic motorik groove of the Neu! original, Woods' rickety aesthetic can't help but keep human imperfection in the mix. These guys don't do ""robotic,"" and no one will ever mistake the laid-back percussion on a Woods record for a drum machine. Which means that the shadowy steady-state psych of ""Out of the Eye"" unfolds patiently and isn't afraid to meander a little. But when it closes abruptly with a quick drum roll seven minutes in, it gives the impression that the preceding was more of a sketch or one-take jam rather than anything designed for a specific effect, which slightly undercuts its power. The nearly 10-minute ""Sol y Sombra"" is the other long track, and it features spare hand percussion, acoustic guitars, and some distant electric guitar leads. It still scans as ""1970s Germany,"" but here the basic model is the pastoral psych of Popol Vuh from the middle of that decade. They both manage to capture a mood and wring feeling out of them, but ""Sol y Sombra"" and ""Out of the Eye"" sometimes have me reaching for the ""skip"" button. That's partly because Woods continue to craft such memorable tunes when working in guitar-pop mode. Like ""Pushing Onlys"", the early single from Sun and Shade, which has chiming guitars and a classic pop melody catchy enough to hang with 60s confections by the Turtles or the Hollies. While Jeremy Earl's cracking voice is in the long line of ""sounds kinda like Neil Young"" high tenors, Woods' Aquarian Age references often lean toward the bouncy and optimistic bubblegum of the era. Here, that spirit comes to the fore on the elegant shuffle ""Who Do I Think I Am?"" and ""What Faces the Sheet"", which is built around a guitar riff vaguely reminiscent of ""Then He Kissed Me"". Folkier songs like ""Be All Be Easy"" and ""Wouldn't Waste"" bring to mind the sound of folk-pop heroes growing into singer-songwriters, a spirit best exemplified by Graham Nash, whom Woods covered on Songs of Shame. In whatever mode they're working, the take-away is that Woods are good at all these sounds, and they seem to be striving to get even better. Despite their ultra-slack style and prodigious output, nothing about them says ""half-assed,"" so it's another year, another fine Woods album.","Woods' latest is another solid record that finds them returning in spots to the experimental vein explored on earlier records and in their live show.

Bachelorette,Bachelorette,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af599d034d5c69bf46dd/1:1/w_160/d2e6a532.jpg,2011-06-01 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15477-bachelorette/,Drag CityParticle Tracks,"""Not Entertainment"" is the closing track on Bachelorette's self-titled third album, and if you take project mastermind Annabel Alpers' lyrics at face value, it's also her swan song. Baldly she admits, ""Nothing Bachelorette makes ever sounds the way I'd like it to,"" and despite cherishing ""the number of believers in the independent music scene,"" Alpers concludes, ""I'd rather watch the others enjoy themselves/ And just be happy that I'm not a part of it."" The song may reflect a struggle on Alpers' part to find motivation and meaning in Bachelorette, and her new album itself often seems to suggest a low-burning flame. As with past Bachelorette ventures, Alpers layers her vocals in all sorts of pretty but unemotional ways to present brainy lyrics atop artily mannered synth tones, grooves, and loops. Her work has an appealing intellectualism, but Alpers often fails to locate the human connection that makes other artists of her ilk great. Her style owes something to Laurie Anderson, but Alpers lacks Anderson's humor. Meanwhile, Stereolab is no less arch, yet they've also made fun, massively grooving pop music. Even contemporary artists who are plying a similar approach, like Sufjan Stevens, Max Tundra, and St. Vincent, find means through hooks or noise or pure emotional expression to make a palpable communion with their audience. If you're willing to fully take Alpers on her own terms, however, there's value in Bachelorette. Specifically, there are a few songs here with lovely vocal melodies and harmonies, namely the stirring, hymn-like ""The Light Seekers"", the utterly gorgeous ""Sugarbug"", and the trilling ""Tui Tui"". You can't help but think that if Alpers lavished more attention on pure sound she wouldn't be far off from producing something similar to Julianna Barwick's The Magic Place. But her sonic backdrops never quite take hold, and modestly buzzy, bloopy tracks like ""Blanket"", ""Polarity Party"", and ""Digital Brain"" only barely compel interest. Meanwhile, Alpers' lyrics are almost uniformly delivered without emphasis and often are wholly indecipherable. Even though wordy, tech-obsessed Alpers leans too heavily at times on 10-cent verbiage, occasionally a meaningful or moving phrase will poke through, like her confession on ""Blanket"" that ""The only way to see you is through the hole in my chest."" Otherwise, lyrical opacity is just another way in which Bachelorette tends to keep you at arm's length. If Alpers' unease on ""Not Entertainment"" reflects a desire for a change, here's hoping she'll pursue avenues that better take advantage of her gifts.","The third album from the New Zealand-bred electro-popper finds her continuing her mix of layered vocals and dense lyricism.

Zayna Jumma,Group Doueh,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4613d197565213a25c/1:1/w_160/393343de.jpg,2011-06-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15461-zayna-jumma/,Sublime Frequencies,"A glorious kind of chaos infiltrated the earliest recorded output by the Western Saharan act Group Doueh (pronounced ""Doo-way"") on the Sublime Frequencies label. Much of the material spanned several decades of recordings culled from the tape archives of band leader Doueh (also known as Salmou Baamar). His disregard for time and trajectory was mirrored in the chopping up of styles from different eras that the band cultivated in their home in Dakhla. Doueh's childhood worship of Jimi Hendrix and James Brown could be keenly felt, but so could traditional forms of Saharoui and Gnawa music. Group Doueh is a family affair, with Doueh employing his wife Halima on vocals, and his sons El Waar (organ/keyboards) and Hamdan (drums). Doueh himself alternates between a three-stringed lute called a tinidit and an electric guitar. Like the prior Beatte Harab, this album was recorded by Sublime Frequencies' Hisham Mayet, who dampened the band's earlier lo-fi recording techniques while maintaining the raw heart of the Group Doueh sound. There has been some notable sonic evolution since Beatte Harab. The tinny percussion of that album is replaced by more boisterous playing from Hamdan, and Doueh is prone to more regularly swapping out the tinidit for his electric guitar. In short, the rock and pop melodies that have always been present are given greater clarity, although Zayna Jumma still rests firmly within that pan-global mash-up of cultures they've ingeniously threaded together. It begins in a place of abstract euphoria, through the casually faltering rhythms of the title track. At times it feels like the tinidit is falling out of sync with Hamdan's beat, but that slackness in the playing functions as the root of the song's slow-build arc into abandon and elation. By the end of the track, Halima and her co-singers are shouting the words as they get all caught up in that frenzied spot they've been teased into by the increasingly maniacal playing. That steady shift into vocal exultation is a common event on Group Doueh recordings, but they also know how to temper those urges, putting the brakes on at just the right time on restrained tracks like ""Met-Ha"" and ""Aziza"". Doueh breaks out some chunky wah-wah guitar to ease in ""Ishadlak Ya Khey"", which might be their most ""rock"" recording to date. But it retains vital components of the band's sound, such as the looseness in the playing that droops at just the right weight between the players. It's a credit to Mayet's work that he made these recordings sound as ""live"" as possible-- on ""Zaya Koum"" it feels like you're sitting in on a cozy session in Dakhla, where Doueh is happy to noodle his way into guitar oblivion while his family works around him. Similarly, on the sputtering ""Jagwar Doueh"", the vocal lines feel like wild one-off improvisations that would have taken on vastly different forms had they been recorded in another time and place. Repetition is a key trait in the Group Doueh sound, and they use it wisely throughout this record. Often it will be a thudding beat that cycles tirelessly in place, allowing Doueh to layer his flanged and wah-ed guitar over the top. At other times, such as on the closing ""Wazan Doueh"", a stringed instrument of some type will loop over and over to form the rhythmic hook. That track is the most trance-like piece here, and its airy delivery demonstrates the band's remarkable versatility. The lightness of touch forms a neat contrast to the raucous close in the opening ""Zayna Jumma"". Doueh seems like a humble man, who'll continue to run his cassette store and work in Group Doueh's primary outlet as a wedding band regardless of the focus afforded to this album. In fact, he resisted all attempts to release his music until Mayet trekked across a large part of northwest Africa to meet him after hearing a few of his songs on the radio. Thankfully that mixture of modesty and reticence didn't endure, because Zayna Jumma is a densely layered piece of cultural cross-pollination that consistently spills over into outright joy.","This Western Saharan family act, who records for Sublime Frequencies, maintains the raw heart of its sound while moving away from its lo-fi roots.

Echolocations EP,Lone,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af67c0084474cd0c1a85/1:1/w_160/c5a26edf.jpg,2011-06-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15488-echolocations-ep/,R&S,"It took me a while to warm to Lone's excellent 2010 LP, Emerald Fantasy Tracks. It's not that the album's charms were particularly subtle, it's that I had no idea where Lone fit in the evolving, chatty conversation that is electronic music. EFT's influences were certainly clear enough: late-1990s Warp beatniks like Boards of Canada and Plaid; Detroit techno; the lite-rave thrum of 808 State. For the first time in his career, Lone had combined them in a way that seemed both clever and obvious. He wasn't so interested in interacting or responding to his peers, but he wasn't sulking in the corner, either: more like industriously building his own fort in it. Echolocations is a six-song EP that feels very much like an extension of EFT. It's natural that, finally having exacted a sound of his own, he would want to refine it. On the whole Echolocations is quicker and more aggressive than his past work, though I'd hesitate to call it more dance-oriented. Lone used to trade in Dilla-style breakbeats, but his drum programming has grown more complex as his tracks have gained steam. Echolocations features his most detailed, strident work to date. Lone fills an impressive amount of space with his percussion. Far from the sparse, digital grooves that dominate techno, Lone organizes his rhythms into flowing streams of hi-hats and snares, interrupting them only to occasionally release his twirling synths upward. Lone has always had a way with keyboard melodies-- it's the Warp influence-- and Echolocations sounds busy, as if his superior drums are trying to ring his superior synths, and vice-versa. The opening track, ""Coreshine Voodoo"" is like watching two cats fight: lots of tussling with no one looking to deliver the killer blow. He smartly contrasts this with leaning, pulsing organ sounds that function more as stabilizing forces than melodic ones. Echolocations doesn't have the breadth of Emerald Fantasy Tracks, but it's probably not supposed to. It plays like an annex to that album, offering a slight, specific variant. But the strength of Echolocations isn't that it offers variety, just that it offers more. EFT was a coming-of-age, and Echolocations is proof that Lone is crafty enough to build upon it without abandoning his new-found identity.","This six-song EP feels very much like an extension of EFT, the electronic producer's last full-length. That proves to be a good thing.

Ukulele Songs,Eddie Vedder,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af66c0084474cd0c1a81/1:1/w_160/19480e0c.jpg,2011-06-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15486-ukulele-songs/,Monkeywrench,"If you include the soundtrack album he recorded for Into the Wild, Ukulele Songs is only Eddie Vedder's second solo album. Considering the size and devotion of his cult, coupled with Pearl Jam's ""No, you really shouldn't have"" over-generosity when it comes to releases, it's remarkable he hasn't put out five by now. This makes Ukulele Songs even more of a curiosity: As its title makes clear, the album consists of 16 tracks of Vedder pawing the tiny, four-stringed Hawaiian instrument and warbling love songs. That's it. In a way, it's as clear-cut a proposition as you're going to get these days. You either instantly know you need 35 minutes of this in your life or are already backing slowly away. The songs themselves date back, in some cases, 10 years or more-- presumably from around the same time Vedder wrote ""Soon Forget"", the two-minute ukulele ditty from Binaural. The rest of the songs occupy that same headspace. They are casual, sweet, and disarmingly unaffected, and you can practically smell the campus green wafting off them. That Vedder is putting Ukulele Songs out during this Big Blowout Year of Pearl Jam (Documentary! Festival! Reissue! Tour!) makes it seem even less of a solo project and more like a a souvenir for longtime Pearl Jam fans. It works best that way. Indeed, in small doses, Ukulele Songs is lovely. Vedder has always been affecting when he's lovelorn, and here he's more or less curled up in a ball of bewildered hurt. ""As I move myself out of your sight/ I'll be sleeping by myself tonight,"" he croons on ""Sleeping By Myself"". The album's best moments-- ""Sleeping By Myself"", ""Without You"", ""Longing to Belong""-- tap the same quietly wounded melancholy as Paul McCartney's 1971 proto-indie pop masterpiece Ram. Alas, 34 minutes is a perilously long time for most to to spend alone with just Eddie Vedder, a ukulele, and his feelings for company. Vedder's precious side has never been his best one (see: No Code's ""Sometimes""), and Ukulele Songs is so determinedly twee and relentlessly self-effacing that it can feel like watching a grown man attempting to morph into a baby koala before your eyes. By itself, hearing Chan Marshall playing Bernadette Peters to Vedder's Steve Martin for the duet ""Tonight You Belong to Me"" is winning and funny; in the context of a full ukulele album, it is slightly cloying. Vedder has said he wants this record to inspire people to pick up the instrument and sing with their friends, an old-fashioned sentiment impossible not to be charmed by. Like a lot of Vedder's experiments, the spirit is easier to admire than the final product. The ukulele might be a great campfire instrument, but sometimes what works best at the campfire should stay there.","Just like it says on the box: The Pearl Jam frontman strums and sings simple love songs.

Codes and Keys,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af61c0084474cd0c1a7b/1:1/w_160/40968f89.jpg,2011-06-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15482-codes-and-keys/,Atlantic,"Leading up to Death Cab for Cutie's last record, 2008's Narrow Stairs, guitarist/producer Chris Walla claimed that they were taking inspiration from Brainiac and ""heavy, sludgy, slow metal,"" and that the record contained a ""10-minute long Can jam."" But nothing on the record sounded remotely similar to those references; the jam in question, ""I Will Possess Your Heart"", actually ran a bit over eight minutes, and I don't think anyone mistook Ben Gibbard for Damo Suzuki. Leading up to the band's latest effort, Codes and Keys, the name-dropping returned, when Gibbard told SPIN that it was keyboard-heavy and ""not guitar-based,"" citing Brian Eno's Another Green World as a hint of what to expect. The claims of extended experimentation, though exaggerated, aren't as spurious this time around. Codes and Keys does sound different from the rest of the band's catalog. Soft pitter-pattered beats rustle underneath sparse melodies, while layers of extra instrumentation are placed atop already-busy arrangements. Two songs (the metronomic ""Doors Unlocked and Open"" and the unmoored piano meditation ""Unobstructed Views"") run well over the five-minute mark; swaths of gentle noise surround even the most straightforward cuts. If you come to this record looking for something as directly engaging as ""Cath..."" or ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"", you're going to walk away empty-handed. Death Cab still sound like Death Cab, but Codes and Keys is undoubtedly the least ""pop"" record they've made since breaking through to the mainstream with their last indie-situated effort, 2003's Transatlanticism. So there's new territory for the band explored here, and Walla, along with mixing maestro Alan Moulder, applies a label-money sheen that provides a decent frame for the record's sonic idiosyncrasies. But for a band so identified with exploring feelings and the details of relationships, the record comes off as chilly, diffident, and emotionally distant. The texture-heavy excursions (""Doors Unlocked and Open"", ""Unobstructed Views"", ""St. Peter's Cathedral"") are adrift and without direction, while early singles ""You Are a Tourist"" and ""Underneath the Sycamore"" sound like generic versions of the band from an earlier era. Indeed, even when the band revisits past glories on Codes and Keys' few highlights, Death Cab weirdly sound like they are imitating themselves. They borrow the baroque Brian Wilson-isms of Narrow Stairs' ""You Can Do Better Than Me"" for ""Portable Television"", copy the upward-moving bridge of The Photo Album's ""I Was a Kaleidoscope"" for the same structural change in ""Monday Morning"", and lift the basic structure of Plans opener ""Marching Bands of Manhattan"" for ""Underneath the Sycamore"". Anyone who's spent the last decade following along will get some warm fuzzies from these flashes of familiarity, but they tend to get stale with repeat listens. The rudderless quality might owe something to the album's sporadic recording process-- eight different studios were employed, and the members of Death Cab rarely sound like they're in the same room together. Most remote of all is Gibbard. His vocals are frequently treated with effects, creating an alienating space that, excepting the moony-eyed closing hymn ""Stay Young, Go Dancing"", robs him of his trademark intimacy. Lyrically, he largely plays it safe, engaging in nonsensical rhymes (""When you scream/ Love you seem"") and sweeping declarative generalizations. Gibbard's evocative narratives and incisive commentary, always overlooked with this band, are mostly missing. Over the last decade, both Death Cab and the landscape around them have changed considerably; while they've signed to a major label and topped the charts, the sensitive-guy Pac NW indie rock archetype they launched a decade ago has receded from the conversation. Another sound that Gibbard had a hand in introducing, however, still reverberates: the gentle, electronic bedroom-pop that he and producer Jimmy Tamborello made as the Postal Service. Those sounds never really infiltrated Death Cab until now, but Codes and Keys doesn't approach that project's level of emotional engagement. Here, Death Cab sound miles apart from each other and, ultimately, from us.","Death Cab are experimenting on their latest full-length, focusing less on tunes and melody and more on electronic sound.

Charade Is Gold,Pulseprogramming,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af63c0084474cd0c1a7e/1:1/w_160/230759a6.jpg,2011-05-31 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15483-charade-is-gold/,Audraglint,"Eight years ago, Pulseprogramming's mind was on the future. On their 2003 full-length, Tulsa For One Second, the Chicago-based group-- which bills itself as a multimedia arts-collective, instead of a rock band-- made glitch-pop. They used laptop computers to marry somber melodies to knock-and-bump rhythms wrought from abstract electronic noise. Nowadays, they're a little more interested in the past. On Charade Is Gold, Pulseprogramming-- now staffed by singer/composer Marc Hellner and vocalist Chanel Pease-- have swapped software for hardware, ditching their laptops for old-school drum machines and MIDI cables. Nearly a decade down the road from their last release, the band has chosen to head backwards in time, delivering a record heavily informed by the electronic music of the 1980s. With its rattling lo-bit snares and lush synth-strings, album opener ""Perfect Problematic"" sounds like it leapt straight out of the decade of Swatch watches and sweatbands, even if the lyrics are a tad dour. ""It's easier to fall apart than to heal/ To suffer the ache of age with nothing left to feel,"" sings Hellner. It sounds like OMD jamming with Ian Curtis after a week of overcast days. Ultimately, it's the sounds of synth-pop Pulseprogramming are interested in-- the woozy new-age chords, the twinkling analog arpeggios-- and not the genre's sunshiny sentiments. As a frontman, Hellner shies away from the soul music-informed delivery favored by his new romantic forebears. Instead he keeps his emotions pitched down and focused, for the most part, on disconnection, disappointment, and acceptance. ""Even though we wait patiently, the truth is, we live with what we get,"" he sings on ""So Right Words Strike Me"", his words frozen in a snowdrift of digital strings. Pulseprogramming's synth-pop ideal is dystopian, rather than utopian-- more Gary Numan than the Human League. Pease and Hellner use the stiff and gridded rhythms of primitive electronics to evoke the endless repetition of workaday life. For groups like Washed Out and Toro y Moi, who are also mining Reagan-era sounds, the past-- as evoked through swoony synths and Roland rhythm boxes-- is a place of bliss and innocence. On Charade Is Gold, Pulseprogramming's take is more moody. They've been around longer and, perhaps, have a clearer memory of the decade's dark side.","The Chicago electronic outfit moves from tech-focused glitch pop to a darker 80s sound with generally positive results.

Everything's Getting Older,Aidan MoffatBill Wells,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3fea9e61561daa6404/1:1/w_160/1f063789.jpg,2011-05-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15454-everythings-getting-older/,Chemikal Underground,"Aidan Moffat has always seemed older than his years. Even his first album with Arab Strap, The Week Never Starts Round Here, felt drawn from an acerbic place in someone with a few more creases in their brow. Moffat was in his early twenties around then, and has since made a career by siphoning his unseemly soliloquies into song. The aging process has often been on his mind throughout; the opening verse from ""The Night Before the Funeral"" from Arab Strap's 1998 record Philophobia reads: ""Too drunk and getting old."" Now he's teamed up with a fellow veteran of the Scottish music world, multi-instrumentalist Bill Wells, to really hammer that point home by titling this record Everything's Getting Older. The duo may have sprouted a few new gray hairs during its making, as the album took some eight years of sporadic recording to reach completion. Much of this record documents Moffat's attempts to reconcile his past and present lives. ""Let's Stop Here"" sets the tone by having him fend off the advances of a former object of his desire, principally due to the fact that he's settled down. But Moffat is happy to show off his fallibility, noting that a younger version of himself is still ticking away inside somewhere, possibly anguishing over his actions as he utters the title of the song. Wells demonstrates his versatility throughout-- ""Let's Stop Here"" is all somber, violin-driven balladry, while the following ""Cages"" is propelled by urgent piano stabs. The latter acutely captures Moffat's current mindset, with reminisces of his lifestyle from Arab Strap's ""The First Big Weekend"" coupled with words on the wretched mundanity of his present existence. Even Moffat's beloved watering holes are aging-- ""the pub's once brilliant copper roof has oxidized over the years and now it's a dull, pastel green,"" he muses in ""The Copper Top"". So Moffat is pretty much where you'd expect him to be as he settles into his late thirties, plagued by innumerable doubts and insecurities. Where Everything's Getting Older loses focus is in the desire of the two players to constantly canter through great stylistic shifts. Perhaps that's not surprising considering the long gestation period of this material. It's been patched together over vast stretches of time, and it shows. Moffat sounds like he's struggling to find his place in the disjointed rhythms of ""A Short Song to the Moon"" and the lite-funk riffing of ""Glasgow Jubilee"". It's when the pair keeps it simple that they stumble upon a space in which they can operate effectively. The basic piano backing of ""Ballad of the Bastard"" and ""The Copper Top"" afford Moffat plenty of room to sink into his particular brand of lyrical discomfort, helping both tracks to become wonderfully drab centerpieces to the album. After those peaks this sags into a marginal piece from both players. The lost spy-thriller theme ""Dinner Time"" and the stripped-down ""The Sadness in Your Life Will Slowly Fade"" are Moffat on autopilot, straining for insight. In the latter he circles back to the album's predominant theme, recalling another night out that made him feel old. But 10 songs into the record, we've now already got the point. Perhaps that's the idea, with Moffat keen to cast himself as an aging bellyacher slumped over the bar, recalling his youth and cursing his advancing years until someone hears him out. It's easy to romanticize such a figure after a one-off encounter, but here it feels like you're being forced to spend time with him on a daily basis. Fortunately Moffat is able to move beyond that with the last two tracks, which find him looking to the future as a father, albeit one with an inclination toward creepy lullabies in ""And So Must We Rest"". It's just a shame he could only chance upon scattered moments of inspiration while coming to uneasy terms with aging elsewhere on Everything's Getting Older.","Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat teams with fellow Scottish music vet multi-instrumentalist Bill Wells to tackle aging, mundanity, and insecurity.

Hungry Mother Blues,Phil Cook & His Feat,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3113d197565213a23c/1:1/w_160/3acfc41c.jpg,2011-05-31 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15442-hungry-mother-blues/,Trekky Records,"Megafaun stand out from a crowded field of Americana-inspired indie rock bands because of their investment in musical heritage, from old-time string bands and traditional folk ballads to jazz to 20th century classical. Last September in Durham, the historically rich North Carolina city the band calls home, they collaborated with former bandmate Justin Vernon, Brooklyn singer/songwriter Sharon Van Etten, and Virginia jazz combo Fight the Big Bull on an expansive reinterpretation of one of American folk's sacred documents, Sounds of the South, the anthology recorded by Alan Lomax circa 1960. It's no stretch to imagine that Megafaun multitasker Phil Cook's immersion in this venerable material shaped the deep-rooted simplicity of his solo debut. During the Sounds of the South premiere, I was especially enamored of Cook's sensitivity as an instrumentalist. On the piano, he had a gracefully leaping sense of melody, and on the banjo, he played clusters of sweet harmonics in places where a less humble musician might have soloed hard. This tasteful and generous temper suffuses Hungry Mother Blues, a collection of instrumental folk compositions mostly for acoustic guitar, banjo, and growling resonator; perhaps a dash of harmonica for color. Cook's Feat are actually just his feet, lightly whomping on a homemade stompbox. He's alone and yet not, conversing with a pantheon of American innovators who favor expressivity over flash: people such as slide guitarist Ry Cooder, the fingerstyle guitarist John Fahey, and the shapeshifting Bill Frisell. The album opens with the welcoming breeze of ""Frazee, Minnesota"", whose lead melody strongly resembles the vocal part of Arthur Russell's ""Maybe She"". While almost certainly coincidental, it gives you an idea of how melodically lucid Cook's writing is. The fluent ""Juniper"" is just as eminently hummable, to an almost crazy degree for instrumental music. These are simple, bucolic themes, brought to life with a deft assortment of bends, slides, and evolving transpositions. Offsetting the earworms are groove-and-atmosphere focused tracks such as the gently galloping, clawhammer banjo tune ""Waiting 'Round the Oven Buns"" and the Cooder-esque ""Ballad of a Hungry Mother"". Overall, it's a great chance to hear the subtle and relaxed touch Cook brings to Megafaun unadorned, save for the barest four-on-the-floor beats here and there. Still, let's be clear: This is not a Megafaun record. There are no freak-outs or electronic interventions or field recordings. It's eight casual-feeling songs in just under 20 minutes, though it's quite diverse within those narrow confines, flowing easily from the moony blues of ""Sparrowander"" to the cockier swagger of ""The Last Steam Engine Train"". Hungry Mother Blues shows us some of the basic underpinnings beneath Megafaun's gritty inventions, reminding us that if you want to make something really new, it helps to be deeply coversant with the old.","Megafaun member offers his solo debut, a collection of instrumental folk compositions mostly for acoustic guitar, banjo, and harmonica.

What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?,The Vaccines,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af04ea9e61561daa6394/1:1/w_160/d5192fbc.jpg,2011-05-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15406-what-did-you-expect-from-the-vaccines/,Columbia,"Late last summer, months before the Vaccines had gone on to grace the front of the NME above a cover line heralding ""The Return of the Great British Guitar Band,"" the magazine's website was already reporting concerns about the London band getting over-hyped. After the feverish debate that quickly ensued in the UK music press, such talk has come to sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Among the Vaccines' detractors, meanwhile, hardly a review deadline goes by without some pun on the quartet's debut album title, What Did You Expect From the Vaccines? The Vaccines, much to their credit, are savvier about expectations than their champions and critics alike. Led by singer Justin Young, who previously played indie-folk under the name Jay Jay Pistolet, and guitarist Freddie Cowan, whose older brother is in the Horrors, these guys know firsthand how hype can be a double-edged sword-- one that has already propelled their meat-and-potatoes pub rock near the top of the UK album charts, to uncertain impact on their long-term reputations. The real joke of the album title, after all, is that it raises the same question the band posed of ""Post Break-Up Sex"" on their bombastic, pleasant-enough second single. The answer, on that song, is that we should expect a chance to forget our past loves for a little while, followed by a sense of overwhelming guilt. For better or worse, there's nothing here that warrants either such reaction, let alone the paroxysms of hyperbole going on in the British press. Sure, the band's buzzing guitars, thick reverb, and bouncy rhythms lack any particular spark of originality that might help listeners avoid compulsively thinking of names like Ramones, the Jesus and Mary Chain, or, yes, the Strokes. Then again, there's no shame in catchy, concise, sharply executed tunes that communicate mildly fresh takes on relationships, either-- and this album has more than a few. The Vaccines are at their best when they're upbeat, flecked with surf, and surprisingly hard to get out of your head. Take ""If You Wanna"", which bops likably along like a somewhat higher-fidelity Best Coast as Young warbles about an ex he'd take back in a second, or ""Nørgaard"", a playfully loutish ode to a Danish model. But there's also ""Blow It Up"", which borrows from the Beatles' ""I Should Have Known Better"" a little too blatantly to enjoy in its own right. ""Under Your Thumb"", for its part, appears to take critic Ellen Willis's argument that the Rolling Stones' similarly titled tirade actually isn't sexist as a challenge to write a song about a man completely submitting to his (presumably, female-- name's Eleanor, anyway) lover. It's easy enough to imagine the Vaccines' slower songs going over well with an outdoor crowd drunk on sun and beer. Previous NME favorites Glasvegas already have the ""swooning anthems with girl-group beats"" thing pretty much covered, but the Vaccines do it here twice: over droning organ on ""Wetsuit"", which again recalls the U.S. beach-pop crowd, and then another time on the dreary ""All in White"", which occupies much the same U2-echoing expanse as lesser bands the Temper Trap or White Lies. The most awkward moment is slo-mo finale ""Family Friend"", which builds to an embarrassingly neutered wall-of-noise crescendo. In a final possible reference to Best Coast, Wavves, and their stoned sunshine set, Young wonders aloud if everybody really feels ""as high as a kite"": ""Well, I don't really know if they do, but they might."" An old ""MADtv"" sketch comes to mind: ""Lowered Expectations"".","Another retrograde UK guitar band held up as the Next Big Thing, the very solid Vaccines aren't either as good or bad as that claim suggests.

Circuital,My Morning Jacket,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af50c0084474cd0c1a5a/1:1/w_160/9ccff710.jpg,2011-05-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/,ATO,"My Morning Jacket have always been something of a mythic outfit. Back in 1999, when the band released its debut LP, The Tennessee Fire (and again in 2001, after the release of At Dawn), its legend was whispered quietly, like a ghost story: Kentucky, grain silos, reverb, that high, liquid voice. As 2001 was the apex of a certain kind of dark, New York City cool-- with the Strokes and Interpol slouching around the Lower East Side in threadbare t-shirts and tiny ties-- My Morning Jacket were steeped in a warm, eerie other-ness that culminated, cathartically, with Jim James howling ""All your life/ Is obscene."" Well, sure. In the ensuing decade, the band became legendary for its heroic live show (in 2008, they stormed through a near-four-hour set at Bonnaroo), but its studio work has always been a little less triumphant. On record, My Morning Jacket can sometimes sound like a band struggling against its own best interests, purposefully eschewing the exact thing-- huge, ghostly, terrifying rock'n'roll-- it does so disarmingly well. Accordingly, the reigning press narrative surrounding Circuital, MMJ's sixth LP, has been focused on the band's supposed ""return to form,"" a response that feels like a direct reaction to its title (or, more likely, to 2008's falsetto-addled Evil Urges, easily the band's most divisive record). But what are they returning to, exactly? My Morning Jacket’s early discography is rooted in oddball experimentation: Despite the open-mouthed riffing, impenetrable reverb, and whipping hair, they’ve never really been a straightforward rock band, especially on record. Jim James' penchant for psychedelic soul is constantly manifesting in new ways, and while Circuital is closer, certainly, to 2005's Z than Evil Urges, it doesn’t feel like a step backwards, or even like a lateral hop. The record opens with James tooting a half-serious introductory ""horn"" riff that belies a goofy sense of humor. James has always been something of a jokester (cue the whispered ""Shaaa!"" at the end of ""Circuital"" or the line, ""They told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen/ Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison,"" from ""Outta My System""), but his voice is so naturally dramatic that even silly bits can sound like earnest proclamations. That's why-- and this is unique to MMJ-- he often sounds best when he's delivering vague platitudes. Still, anyone who's ever heard James wail in concert is likely to be frustrated by the eternal underuse of his voice in the studio, even when the songs were ostensibly recorded live. There are a few tracks here where producer Tucker Martine captures it in all its intoxicating splendor-- the acoustic lament ""Wonderful (The Way I Feel)"" especially-- but most only hint at what James is capable of delivering in person. His falsetto (contentious since the days of ""Highly Suspicious"") comes back for ""Holdin on to Black Metal"", a bizarre bit of jam-funk that alternates between pleasantly spirited and genuinely stupid (it's a cautionary tale about not growing out of black metal fandom, and ends with a shout of ""Let's rock!""). On ""Slow Slow Tune"", James sounds remarkably vulnerable, singing to his future progeny over a barely there, bubblegum guitar figure that recalls the Everly Brothers before transitioning into a Flaming Lips-style burnout. Like nearly all of their studio albums, Circuital may not reach the heights of the band's live show-- a good MMJ concert can recalibrate your gut, it can change you-- but it’s a remarkably solid step for a band that's never stopped evolving.","Toning down some of the experimentation of Evil Urges, My Morning Jacket return with an album that touches on highlights from their earlier work.
